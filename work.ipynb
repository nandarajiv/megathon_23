      "- When you think about diabetes drugs, you may think of insulin or other medications that you get from a shot or a pump. But there are others that you take as a pill or that you inhale. Your doctor will consider exactly what you need, which may include more than one type of diabetes medicine. The goal is to get your best blood sugar control, and the oral drugs do that in several ways. Acarbose ( Precose) How it works: Blocks enzymes that help digest starches, slowing the rise in blood sugar. It belongs to a group of drugs called âalpha-glucosidase inhibitors.â Side effects for these kinds of drugs include stomach upset (gas, diarrhea, nausea, cramps). Alogliptin ( Nesina) How it works: Boosts insulin levels when blood sugars are too high, and tells the liver to cut back on making sugars. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â DPP- IV inhibitor.â These drugs do not cause weight gain. You may take them alone or with another drug, like metformin. Bromocriptine mesylate ( Cycloset, Parlodel) How it works: This tablet raises the level of dopamine, a brain chemical. It's approved help improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. It's not used to treat type 1 diabetes. Canagliflozin ( Invokana) How it works: Boosts how much glucose leaves your body in urine, and blocks your kidney from reabsorbing glucose. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â SGLT2 inhibitor.â Side effects can include: Vaginal yeast infections Urinary tract infections Dizziness, fainting Ketoacidosis or ketosis Increased risk of bone fracture Decreased bone mineral density Chlorpropamide ( Diabinese) How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â This drug is not used as often as newer sulfonylureas. Side effects of sulfonylureas include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Colesevelam ( Welchol) How it works: Lowers âbadâ ( LDL) cholesterol and improves blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Your doctor will call this type of drug a âbile acid sequestrant.â Dapagliflozin ( Farxiga) How it works: Boosts how much glucose leaves your body in urine, and blocks your kidney from reabsorbing glucose. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â SGLT2 inhibitor.â Empagliflozin ( Jardiance) How it works: Boosts how much glucose leaves your body in urine, and blocks your kidney from reabsorbing glucose. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â SGLT2 inhibitor.â Glimepiride ( Amaryl) How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â Side effects of sulfonylureas include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Glipizide ( Glucotrol and Glucotrol XL) How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â Side effects of sulfonylureas include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Glyburide ( Dia Beta, Glynase Pres Tab) How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â Side effects of sulfonylureas include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Inhaled Insulin ( Afrezza) How you take it: You put a cartridge, which contains a dose of this powdered, rapid-acting insulin, into an inhaler, and you use it before meals or soon after you start to eat. How it works: The insulin quickly moves from lung cells into the bloodstream. It doesn't replace long-acting insulin (which you can't inhale). You should not use it if you have a long-term lung disease, such as asthma or COPD, or if you smoke. It's not recommended for treating diabetic ketoacidosis. Linagliptin ( Tradjenta) How it works: Boosts insulin levels when blood sugars are too high, and tells the liver to cut back on making sugars. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â DPP- IV inhibitor.â These drugs do not cause weight gain. You may take them alone or with another drug, like metformin. Metformin ( Fortamet, Glucophage, Glucophage XR, Glumetza, Riomet) How they work: Improve insulin's ability to move sugar into cells, especially muscle cells. They also prevent the liver from releasing stored sugar. You should not take them if you have kidney damage or heart failure. Your doctor may call this type of drug a âbiguanide.â Side effects for biguanides include: Upset stomach (nausea, diarrhea) Metallic taste in mouth Miglitol ( Glyset) How it works: Blocks enzymes that help digest starches, slowing the rise in blood sugar. It belongs to a group of drugs your doctor may call âalpha-glucosidase inhibitors.â Side effects for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors include stomach upset (gas, diarrhea, nausea, cramps). Nateglinide ( Starlix) How it works: Makes the pancreas release more insulin, but only if your blood sugar levels are too high. Your doctor may call this type of drug a âmeglitinide.â Side effects of meglitinides include: Low blood sugar Stomach upset Pioglitazone ( Actos) How it works: Helps insulin work better in muscle and fat. It lowers the amount of sugar the liver releases and makes fat cells more sensitive to insulin's effects. It may take a few weeks for these drugs to lower blood sugar. Your doctor should talk with you about heart risks with this type of drug, which he may call âthiazolidinediones.â Side effects from this type of drug are rare but may include: Higher than normal levels of liver enzymes Liver failure Respiratory infection Headache Fluid retention Repaglinide ( Prandin) How it works: Makes the pancreas release more insulin, but only if your blood sugar levels are too high. Your doctor may call this type of drug a âmeglitinide.â Side effects of this type of drug include: Low blood sugar Stomach upset Rosiglitazone ( Avandia) How it works: Helps insulin work better in muscle and fat. It lowers the amount of sugar the liver releases and makes fat cells more sensitive to insulin's effects. It may take a few weeks for this kind of drug to lower blood sugar. Your doctor should talk with you about heart risks with this type of drug, which he may call âthiazolidinediones.â Side effects for thiazolidinediones are rare but may include: Higher than normal levels of liver enzymes Liver failure Respiratory infection Headache Fluid retention Saxagliptin ( Onglyza) How it works: Boosts insulin levels when blood sugars are too high, and tells the liver to cut back on making sugars. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â DPP- IV inhibitor.â These drugs do not cause weight gain. You may take them alone or with another drug, like metformin. Sitagliptin ( Januvia) How it works: Boosts insulin levels when blood sugars are too high and tells the liver to cut back on making sugars. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â DPP- IV inhibitor.â These drugs do not cause weight gain. You may take them alone or with another drug, like metformin. Tolazamide How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â This drug is not used as often as newer sulfonylureas. Side effects of this kind of drug include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Tolbutamide How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â This drug is not used as often as newer sulfonylureas. Side effects of this kind of drug include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Combination Medicines Several diabetes pills combine two medications into one tablet. They include: Alogliptin and metformin ( Kazano) Alogliptin plus pioglitazone ( Oseni) Dapagliflozin and metformin ( Xigduo XR) Empagliflozin and linaglipton ( Glyxambi) Empagliflozin and metformin ( Synjardy) Glipizide and metformin Glyburide and metformin ( Glucovance) Linagliptin and metformin ( Jentadueto) Pioglitazone and glimepiride ( Duetact) Repaglinide and metformin ( Prandi Met) Rosiglitazone and glimepiride ( Avandaryl) Rosiglitazone and metformin ( Avandamet) Saxagliptin and metformin ( Kombiglyze XR) Sitagliptin and metformin ( Janumet, Janumet XR)\n",
      "- If you have angina -- chest pain that happens when the arteries to your heart are blocked or narrowed -- your doctor may prescribe medicines called nitrates. They relax your arteries so blood can flow more easily to your ticker. Your doctor may also suggest you use nitrates along with another blood pressure drug (hydralazine) to treat congestive heart failure. Some nitrates include: Dilatrate- SR, Iso- Bid, Isonate, Isorbid, Isordil, Isotrate, Sorbitrate (isosorbide dinitrate) Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate) Bi Dil (hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate) Follow the label directions on when and how to take them. It's OK to take these drugs with or without meals. Sometimes, \"medication tolerance\" can set in, which means they don't work as well anymore. Keep up with your appointments so your doctor can monitor how well you respond to the drug. Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand how to take these medications during the day. The number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and how long you need to take them depend on your condition. While you're using nitrates, get your blood pressure checked regularly. Nitrates may make you feel dizzy. You may also get a rapid, irregular, or pounding heartbeat when you take the drugs regularly. It usually gets better after the first few weeks. If it keeps up, talk to your doctor. Some other side effects are: Headache Flushing of your face or neck. Call your doctor if it persists or is severe. Low blood pressure. You shouldn't take nitrates if you: Had severe allergic reactions to medicines with nitroglycerin or isosorbide Take some erectile dysfunction drugs such as Cialis (tadalafil), Levitra (vardenafil), or Viagra (sildenafil). Have narrow-angle glaucoma\n",
      "- Surgery can often cure long-term ulcerative colitis ( UC), but it's not for everyone. Your doctor may suggest an operation if your UC is severe and you don't get enough help from other treatments, like medicines and changes in your diet. It could also be an option to help you prevent colon cancer. There are two procedures. Both are major surgery on your digestive system. Get to know the details of each operation, and talk with your doctor about which one he recommends for you. What it is. In this procedure, also called IPAA (ileal pouch-anal anastomosis), your surgeon removes the part of your bowel that's causing trouble, including your colon and rectum. He'll use the end of your small intestine, called the ileum, to make a pouch inside your body that collects waste. Then he'll connect the pouch to your anus. What are the side effects? The pouch can become irritated or inflamed, which is called pouchitis. Antibiotics usually take care of the problem. What to expect after the surgery. Because muscles around your anus aren't affected, you'll eventually be able to get rid of food waste the usual way, on the toilet. At first, you'll need to wear a bag outside your body over a stoma -- a surgical hole in your belly connected to your intestine -- to remove the solid waste, while your new internal pouch heals. You'll still go to the bathroom often, but probably not as much as before the operation. In time, you may go even less frequently. You may find that you can eat more foods than before you had the surgery, or you may feel better with your familiar foods. Try items one at a time to see how you feel. And don't eat within 3-4 hours of bedtime. Give your recovery some time. Most people eventually get back to all of their usual activities. In the meantime, if you find that you tire out faster than usual, remember that you're healing from the operation. Your doctor can let you know about any limits you should have during your recovery. For instance, women who get the surgery should avoid sex for 6 weeks. What it is. The surgeon removes your colon, rectum, and anus. This operation reroutes part of your digestive system so food waste goes from your small intestine straight out of your body through a hole, or stoma. It collects in an external pouch, or bag, that's connected to the outside of your lower belly. You change it when it gets full. Your ileostomy may be permanent, or you might get it as a temporary measure before you get a J-pouch. What are the side effects? As with any operation, there is a chance of infection. What to expect afterward. You should be able to go back to many of your daily activities in about 4 to 6 weeks. You may need more time before you can do things that are physically hard, like heavy lifting. You can wear your regular clothes and even shower with the pouch on. It shouldn't show under your clothes or affect how you dress, but you might want to keep tight belts off of the stoma. If the bag is on securely, no one should smell any odors. It will probably take time to adjust to living with the stoma and the ileostomy system. But you should get used to emptying the pouch with a little practice. When you eat: Chew your food well. You may need to limit fiber, such as popcorn, foods with seeds, nuts, and raw veggies. Avoid gassy foods such as soda and beans. You can feel confident about being back in your regular routine. Once you've healed, you can do everything you did before the operation -- go to work, play sports, have sex. But it is an adjustment, so talk to your doctor about how you can handle this change.\n",
      "- Congratulations! You've survived the first two months, and will soon be getting a glimpse of your baby's personality. Even though your little one is just 2 months old, your baby may already be smiling, looking at you, and starting to hold her head up! This is a great time to talk to your baby's doctor about these exciting developmental milestones and more. Here's what to expect at your baby's 2-month checkup. Give your baby's first combination immunizations. These may include: DTa P (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) Hib (haemophilus influenzae type b) IPV (polio vaccine) PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) HBV (hepatitis B) RV (rotavirus) Remember, these vaccines are safe, and your baby really needs them to protect her from many life-threatening illnesses, such as pertussis or whooping cough. Is your baby getting tummy time? Can your baby hold her head up sometimes? Has your baby smiled yet? Is your baby alert to sounds? Is your baby stretching and moving her arms and legs well? Should my baby be nursing less often now? When is it time to start solid food? Continue to feed your baby when she wants to be fed, about 7 to 8 times a day. Your baby may be going longer between feedings and have fewer poopy diapers, and that's okay. Spitting up is common. Holding your baby upright in your arms, in a swing, or in a car seat for about 30 minutes after feeding may help. Make sure you continue to burp her after each feeding. Don't give your baby infant cereal, juice, or other solids yet. Her digestive system is not ready. And NO water. Breast milk or formula is all your baby needs right now! I'm so tired -- when will my baby sleep through the night? How can I help my baby learn to go to sleep on her own? Just hang in there! Your baby may start sleeping for 6-hour stretches at night very soon -- some babies do this as early as 10 weeks of age. To encourage night sleep, change or feed your baby at night with low lights on and don't play with your baby right before bed. This way, your baby knows it's time to sleep, not play. To help your baby go to sleep on her own, put your baby down when she's drowsy, not overly tired. This is also a great time to start talking to your baby. She'll be fascinated by your voice and will likely respond with coos and smiles! And enjoy every moment -- your baby will change quickly!\n",
      "- Biologics are genetically engineered proteins made from human genes. Unlike other RA medications that affect your entire immune system, biologics zero in on specific parts that control the inflammation process. Aggressive treatment can help prevent long-term disability from rheumatoid arthritis. So if you have moderate to severe RA and don't respond to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs), your doctor will probably say it's time for a biologic. You might take it alone or along with other rheumatoid arthritis medications. Abatacept ( Orencia) Adalimumab ( Humira), Adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), Adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita) Anakinra ( Kineret) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel), Etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria) Infliximab ( Remicade), Infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), Infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra) Rituximab ( Rituxan) Tocilizumab ( Actemra) Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz) There are several. They include: B-cell inhibitor: They affect B cells, which are white blood cells that carry a protein that can trigger your immune response. Interleukin-1 ( IL-1) blocker: Stops production of an inflammatory chemical your body makes Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) or interleukin-17 blocker: Stops inflammatory chemicals from attaching to cells Janus kinase ( JAK) inhibitor: Blocks proteins that trigger the inflammation process T-cell inhibitor: Blocks communication between T cells, a type of white blood cell T umor necrosis factor ( TNF) inhibitor: Blocks a chemical your body makes that drives the inflammation process Your doctor might give you a biosimilar. These are copies of existing biologics. Like generic medications, they cost less than the original. Unlike generic medications though, they aren't 100% the same. That's because biologics are made from living organisms. Don't worry, though. Drugmakers have to prove they're just as safe and effective as the original and that they work the same way. You get the same dose the same way at the same strength. You'll know your medication is a biosimilar if it has a dash after the generic name, followed by four letters. The FDA has approved these medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis. You might take a biologic alone or with another arthritis drug. As a general rule, you shouldn't take different biologic therapies at the same time. Abatacept ( Orencia): This medication works by blocking T cells. You get it in a shot every week or by IV once a month. The most common side effects include headache, a cold, a sore throat, and nausea. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita): These medications target tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You get them as a shot once every 2 weeks. The most common side effects are colds, a sinus infection, headache, and rash. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Anakinra ( Kineret): This medicine targets interleukin-1 ( IL-1). You take it as a shot once a day. The most common side effects are pain or skin reactions in the area where you get the shot, colds, headache, and nausea. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Certolizumab ( Cimzia): This biologic targets tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You take it as a shot every 2-4 weeks. ( Your doctor will decide how often you get it.) Its most common side effects are the flu or a cold, a rash, and urinary tract infections. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi): This medication targets tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You take it as a shot 1-2 times each week. The most common side effects are skin reactions or pain where you get the shot, sinus infections, and a headache. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too, Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria): These biologics target tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You'll take Simponi as a monthly shot and Simponi Aria every 8 weeks by IV. The most common side effects are a runny nose; sore throat; hoarseness or laryngitis; pain, skin reactions, or tingling where you got the shot; and viral infections like the flu and cold sores. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra): This medication targets tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You take it by IV. Your doctor will decide on the dose and how often you should take it. The most common side effects are respiratory infections (like sinus infections and a sore throat), headache, coughing, and stomach pain. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Rituximab ( Rituxan): This medication targets B cells. You take it as an infusion by IV. Your first two infusions will be 2 weeks apart. You can repeat the infusions every 6 months. The most common side effects are reactions to the infusion, chills, infections, body aches, tiredness, and a low white blood cell count. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Tocilizumab ( Actemra): This medication targets interleukin-6 ( IL-6). You can take it by IV once a month. Or you can get shots every week or every other week. The most common side effects are a cold, sinus infection, a headache, high blood pressure, or liver problems. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz): This medicine targets Janus kinase ( JAK) proteins. You take it as a pill either once or twice a day, depending on the dosage. The most common side effects are a cold, sinus infection, headache, high blood pressure, and liver problems. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis. They should check for changes to your cholesterol levels or liver enzymes and track your while blood cell count while you take it, too. The most common are pain and rash at the injection site. But they only affect a small number of people who take these drugs. Biologics can cause allergic reactions. Because they go directly into a vein, you'll get the infusion at a place where your doctor can keep an eye on you. Reaction symptoms include flu-like illness, fever, chills, nausea, and headache. As with any drugs that suppress your immune system, biologics can make you more likely to get infections and other diseases. See the doctor ASAP if you have a fever or unexplained symptoms. You may need to get vaccinations to prevent infections before you start a biologic. Don't get any while you're taking one, though. Biologics may cause some dormant chronic diseases (like tuberculosis) to flare. They may not be a good idea if you have multiple sclerosis or other conditions like severe congestive heart failure. Your doctor will give you a skin or blood test for tuberculosis before you start a biologic. You also need a test for chronic hepatitis B and C. Although animal studies of biologics show they don't affect fertility or hurt the baby, they can't always predict what will happen to humans who take the drugs. Because we don't know how they affect a developing child, pregnant women should use them only if the need is great. Your doctor will tell you to stop your biologic before surgery. You can start again when your wounds have healed and your chance of getting an infection has passed.\n",
      "- Let's start with the basics. Antacids neutralize excess stomach acid to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, acid indigestion, and stomach upset. They are sometimes prescribed in addition to other meds to help relieve the pain of stomach and duodenal ulcers. Some antacids also contain simethicone, an ingredient that helps eliminate excess gas. You should take antacids exactly as directed by your doctor, or according to the manufacturer's directions. For stomach or duodenal ulcers, take the medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. If you are using the tablets, chew them well before swallowing for faster relief. Serious side effects can occur with an overdose or overuse of antacids. Side effects include constipation, diarrhea, change in the color of bowel movements, and stomach cramps. Products containing calcium may cause kidney stones and are more likely to cause constipation. Products like famotidine ( Pepcid- AC) are called histamine-2 blockers or H2 blockers. These drugs reduce production of stomach acid. Pepcid AC and other H2 blockers, such as ranitidine ( Zantac 75) are available in prescription-strength or in lower doses in over-the-counter varieties. These products are for relief of heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach, and other conditions, such as stomach ulcers. Another type of heartburn medication, known as proton pump inhibitors, may be used when antacids or H2 blockers fail. PPIs block the secretion of acid from the stomach. Prilosec (omeprazole), Lansoprazole ( Prevacid), and esomeprazole ( Nexium 24 HR) can be bought over the counter. Pantoprazole ( Protonix), rabeprazole ( Aciphex), dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant), and esomeprazole ( Nexium) are examples of other PPIs that are available only by prescription. PPIs generally cause few side effects, but they do interact with other common drugs such as warfarin ( Coumadin), some heart medications and antibiotics, so it is important to review all medications with your doctor. Antacids work the quickest to relieve occasional heartburn. For patients who do not respond to antacids, H2 blockers and PPIs are alternatives. Remember, though, that frequent or severe episodes of reflux should always be discussed with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to take antacids when you start taking H2 blockers to help control your symptoms until the H2 blocker takes effect. If your doctor prescribes an antacid, take it an hour before or an hour after H2 blockers. Take H2 blockers regularly for as long as directed by your doctor, even if you do not have any pain or your symptoms improve. Possible serious side effects that need to be reported to your doctor right away include confusion, chest tightness, bleeding, sore throat, fever, irregular heartbeat, weakness, and unusual fatigue. Other less serious side effects include mild headache, dizziness, and diarrhea, which are usually temporary and will likely go away on their own. Occasional heartburn is common and generally not serious. However, prolonged heartburn can be a symptom of a serious problem, such as esophagitis. Esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of the esophagus, the food tube. Esophagitis occurs when stomach acid repeatedly comes into contact with the lining of the esophagus. If esophagitis is severe, the person can develop Barrett's esophagus and even cancer. Over time, this condition can narrow the passageway from the esophagus to the stomach. Your husband should consult his doctor for further evaluation. When a person requires more than twice-weekly over-the-counter drugs for heartburn, a doctor should be consulted. An endoscopy to visualize his esophagus may also be recommended. A hernia is the pressing of an organ through an opening in the muscle wall of the cavity that protects it. With a hiatal hernia, a portion of the stomach pushes through the hole where the esophagus and the stomach join. The most common cause of a hiatal hernia is an increase in pressure on the abdominal cavity. Pressure can come from coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, heavy lifting, or physical strain. Pregnancy, obesity, or excess fluid in the abdomen also can cause hiatal hernias. A hiatal hernia can develop in people of all ages and both sexes, although it frequently affects middle-aged people. In fact, the majority of otherwise healthy people over age 50 have small hiatal hernias. Many people with a hiatal hernia never have any symptoms. In some people, acid and digestive juices escape from the stomach into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). This causes: Heartburn A bitter or sour taste in the back of the throat Bloating and belching Discomfort or pain in the stomach or esophagus Vomiting Most hiatal hernias do not cause problems and rarely need treatment. Successful treatment of hiatal hernias usually involves treating the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) that are triggered by the additional pressure in the abdomen. Treatment includes: Making lifestyle changes, such as: Losing weight, if you are overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight Having a common-sense approach to eating, such as eating moderate to small portions of foods, and limiting fatty foods, acidic foods (such as tomatoes and citrus fruits or juices), foods containing caffeine, and alcoholic beverages Eating meals at least three to four hours before lying down and avoiding bedtime snacks Elevating the head of your bed by 6 inches (this helps allow gravity to keep the stomach contents in the stomach) Not smoking Wearing looser clothing, especially around the waistline Taking medications, such as over-the-counter antacids or H2 blockers or PPIs. Note: If you take over-the-counter drugs and see no improvement or take them for longer than two weeks, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe a stronger medication. If medications and lifestyle changes are not effective in treating your symptoms, diagnostic tests may be performed to determine if surgery is necessary. People with a hiatal hernia who also have severe, chronic esophageal reflux may need surgery to correct the problem if their symptoms are not relieved through these management techniques. Surgery may also be needed to reduce the size of the hernia if it is in danger of becoming constricted or strangulated (so that the blood supply is cut off). During surgery, gastroesophageal reflux is corrected by pulling the hiatal hernia back into the abdomen and creating an improved valve mechanism at the bottom of the esophagus. The surgeon wraps the upper part of the stomach (called the fundus) around the lower portion of the esophagus. This creates a tighter sphincter so that food will not reflux back into the esophagus. Hiatal hernia surgery can be performed either by opening the abdominal cavity or laparoscopically. During laparoscopic surgery, five or six small (5 to 10 millimeter) incisions are made in the abdomen. The laparoscope and surgical instruments are inserted through these incisions. The surgeon is guided by the laparoscope, which transmits a picture of the internal organs on a monitor. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery include smaller incisions, less risk of infection, less pain and scarring, and a more rapid recovery. More than half of all pregnant women report heartburn, particularly during their third trimester. Heartburn occurs during pregnancy, in part, because your digestive system works more slowly due to changing hormone levels. Also, your enlarged uterus can crowd your stomach, pushing stomach acids upward. Here are some ways you can reduce your heartburn during pregnancy: Eat several small meals each day instead of three large ones. Eat slowly. Avoid fried, spicy, or rich foods, or any foods that seem to increase your heartburn. Don't lie down directly after eating. Keep the head of your bed higher than the foot of your bed. Ask your doctor about trying over-the-counter heartburn relievers such as Tums or Maalox. If your heartburn persists, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe drugs that are safe to take during pregnancy. What's on your plate can impact heartburn, GERD, and Barrett's esophagus. Eating certain foods, including onions, peppermint, and high-fat foods, as well as drinking alcohol, can cause the lower esophageal sphincter muscle, which controls the opening between the esophagus and the stomach, to relax. Usually, this muscle remains tightly closed except when food is swallowed. However, when this muscle fails to close, the acid-containing contents of the stomach can travel back up into the esophagus, producing a burning sensation commonly referred to as heartburn. Caffeinated beverages and foods (such as coffee, tea, colas, and chocolate) can also aggravate heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD). Tomatoes, citrus fruits, or juices also contribute additional acid that can irritate the esophagus. In addition, smoking relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, contributing to heartburn and GERD. Improving your eating habits can also reduce reflux. After eating, keep an upright posture. Eat moderate portions of food and smaller meals. Lastly, eat meals at least three to four hours before lying down, and avoid bedtime snacks. Barrett's esophagus is a change in the lining of the lower esophagus that develops in some people who have chronic GERD or inflammation of the esophagus. The symptoms of Barrett's esophagus are the same as those of GERD, although often more severe. These symptoms include a burning sensation under the chest and acid regurgitation. These symptoms generally decrease with drugs that reduce acid in the stomach. Some people with Barrett's esophagus may not have any symptoms at all. The only way to confirm the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is with a test called an upper endoscopy. This involves inserting a small, lighted tube (endoscope) through the throat and into the esophagus to look for a change in the lining of the esophagus. While the appearance of the esophagus may suggest Barrett's esophagus, the diagnosis can only be confirmed with small samples of tissue (biopsy) obtained through the endoscope. The treatment of Barrett's esophagus is similar to the treatment of reflux. This includes lifestyle changes, such as avoiding certain foods and eating late in the evening, smoking cessation, and wearing loose-fitting clothing, along with using medications that will decrease acid production by the stomach. Patients with Barrett's esophagus typically need PPI drugs to reduce acid. Barrett's esophagus may lead to the development of cancer of the esophagus in some patients, although this risk is smaller than once thought. Up to 0.5% of those with Barrett's esophagus will develop esophageal cancer each year. Esophageal cancer develops through a sequence of changes in the cells of the esophagus known as dysplasia. Dysplasia can only be detected by a biopsy. Patients with Barrett's esophagus should talk to their doctors about having regular screening exams to detect cancer at an early and potentially curable stage. Studies are in progress to develop a more effective treatment for Barrett's esophagus. One treatment, known as ablation therapy, removes the abnormal cells with heat or laser light. Other new treatments are also under development.\n",
      "- Diets based on the glycemic index -- Sugar Busters, the Zone Diet, and Nutrisystem - are more famous than the original â G. I. Diet.â The glycemic index was designed to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. And what works to control blood sugar, the theory goes, should help you drop extra weight. Like its better-known children, the glycemic index diet focuses on carbs. It gets a little complicated, but here's the basic idea: Some foods -- like white bread, cookies, and white potatoes -- make your blood sugar rise quickly. On the glycemic index diet, you eat carbs that produce a steadier rise in blood sugar; and the fiber in those foods helps you feel full longer. You're not as hungry, and you feel more satisfied. Sticking to a low glycemic index diet may help prevent conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it's not certain that this diet can help you lose weight any better or faster than a low-fat, low-carb, generally healthy diet. One study showed that people on a low-glycemic diet lost more fat than those on a high-glycemic diet with the same calories. Overall, the scientific evidence is mixed and unable to show consistent findings. Foods on the glycemic index diet are scored on a scale of 0 to 100 based on how much they raise your blood sugar level. High- GI foods (70 or higher): white rice, white bread, pretzels, white bagels, white baked potatoes, crackers, sugar-sweetened beverages Medium- GI foods (56-69): grapes, spaghetti, ice cream, raisins, corn on the cob Low- GI foods (55 and under): oatmeal, peanuts, peas, carrots, kidney beans, hummus, skim milk, most fruits (except those listed above and watermelon) On the diet, you try to eat more foods in the low- GI category, and fewer in the high- GI group. You don't have to do any calorie counting or portion control, and you can eat a pretty varied diet. You also don't need to cut out almost all carbs. You do need to be selective about your carbs, checking the glycemic index value of the foods you eat. Limitations: The glycemic index diet can be confusing. Just because a food is low on the index doesn't mean it's healthy. And some high glycemic index foods offer a lot of nutrition. For example, parsnips have a higher glycemic index value (52) than vanilla cake (42). Also, the diet doesn't offer advice on non-carb foods. It's up to you to figure out how many calories and how much fat you're getting each day. And eating some foods in combination -- like a high glycemic index carb with protein and fat, for example -- can affect how much your blood sugar rises. Cooking and shopping: You can shop and cook like you normally would, but you need to use ingredients that are low on the glycemic index. Packaged foods or meals: None are required, but certain programs -- like Nutrisystem -- that follow the glycemic index diet do include packaged meals. In-person meetings: No. Exercise: Exercise is not part of this diet. Yes. People who are on vegetarian, gluten-free, and other diets that are restrictive can follow this plan. You can choose foods you like, but you may need to make substitutions. Your diet needs to be healthy, and that involves more than the glycemic index. Be wary of diets that recommend extreme approaches, like eating a lot of meat or other foods that are high in saturated fat. Cost: How much you spend depends on where you shop for groceries and the foods you buy. If you join a plan, you will have to pay the cost of packaged food. Support: Usually you'll do this program on your own. You can get food and menu ideas in books like The Glucose Revolution or Sugar Busters! Does It Work? The glycemic index diet is really not a weight loss diet. For people with diabetes who count carbs to manage their blood sugar, this diet will help you choose carbs wisely. Keep in mind that the glycemic index diet doesn't cover everything you eat or should eat for a healthy diet. Some higher-glycemic foods are still healthy for you, like sweet potatoes. And some lower-glycemic foods can pack a lot of calories if you eat too many, like nuts. So while the glycemic index may guide your choice of carbs, you'll have to decide how much of them to eat. And you'll have to monitor how much protein and fat you're getting, as well. There are other diet plans that remove the guesswork by putting all this information together, so those might work better for you. If you are at risk for diabetes, then incorporating the glycemic index may help you keep your blood sugars in check. Is It Good for Certain Conditions? It can help if you have diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends traditional carb counting for blood sugar control with the glycemic index information to help âfine tuneâ meal planning. This diet may also help if you are insulin-resistant or have prediabetes. If you have a combination of high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol, and are overweight, that may include you. Research suggests that people with insulin resistance lose weight more easily on a low-carb diet. The added benefit of better blood sugar control is you lower your odds of getting complications from diabetes, including heart, eye, and kidney disease. The Final Word The glycemic index diet was developed to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar, and that's what it's best for. For those with diabetes or prediabetes, this diet is an important piece in the big picture of taking charge of the food you eat and staying healthy and active.\n",
      "- Smart eating habits can make your life a little easier when you have irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, or IBS- D. And you don't have to completely give up any foods you like. \" Moderation is important,\" says Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, author of the American Dietetic Association ( ADA) Guide to Better Digestion. It's important to stick to a balanced diet when you have IBS. So never totally avoid certain groups of food, or you may be depriving yourself of nutrients you need. Experiment with what you eat to find out what works for you Bonci says. \" People could be selective with what they have, saying, ' OK, I'm no good with apples, but I'm alright with a pear. Or grapes don't work for me, but I'm OK with having a little bit of a banana.'\" Keep a symptom journal to track which foods and which amounts seem to give you diarrhea. It's the best way to figure out which eats might be causing you problems. Remember, different foods affect people differently. You could also try an elimination diet -- if you think certain foods might be triggering your symptoms, stop eating them one at a time, and see how that makes you feel. Don't avoid fiber if you have diarrhea. It helps protect your body against heart disease, by lowering your LDL cholesterol, and certain cancers, so you need it. Simply eat more soluble fiber, rather than the insoluble kind, Bonci says. Soluble fiber stays in the gut longer, which helps the colon work normally. You find soluble fiber in foods such as: Oats Peas Beans Apples Citrus fruits Carrots Barley Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, is found in things like: Whole-wheat flour Wheat bran Nuts Beans Cauliflower Green beans Potatoes Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help. Examples of supplements include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly to help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake. As long as your doctor has not restricted your fluids, shoot for six to eight 8-ounce glasses of plain H2 O each day, but not always with meals. \" Water just makes everything run through a little more rapidly,\" Bonci says. She suggests you drink it an hour before or an hour after meals. Only you know which ones give you IBS- D symptoms. But while you figure out your own triggers, you might want to take special care with foods known to cause symptoms in some people with your condition: Broccoli, onions, and cabbage Fried or fatty foods like French fries Milk or dairy products such as cheese or ice cream Alcohol Caffeine in coffee, teas, and some sodas Carbonated sodas Chocolate Gluten, found in wheat, rye, and barley Sorbitol, a sugar substitute found in gum and mints, and fructose, a simple sugar in honey and some fruits, also trigger IBS symptoms in some people. How you eat may also give you trouble. You might be bothered by foods with extreme temperatures, especially if you have them together, like ice-cold water with steaming hot soup. Many people get symptoms after large meals. Try to eat less at each meal, or have four or five small meals a day. Remember, your reactions to what you eat are unique, Bonci says. So experiment with different foods until you've come up with your own IBS nutrition prescription. \" There isn't an IBS diet, per se,\" Bonci says. â Some people will find they're OK with particular foods, and other people find there's just no way.\"\n",
      "- When you have type 2 diabetes, you want to get the most bang for your exercise buck. You'll need to fuel up the right way before, during, and after you work out. If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack. What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar. If your reading is between 200 and 300 mg/dl and you've already eaten at least once that day, you probably don't need to eat anything. But you do need to check for ketones if it's over 250. Your body makes them when it burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. Don't exercise if you have them. If your reading is over 300, ask your doctor if exercise is OK. Otherwise, grab a snack with 15-30 grams of carbs. The lower your blood sugar is before you start and the longer you plan to work out, the larger your snack should be, up to 30 grams of carbs. You'll probably have to try a few options and amounts to see what works best. These snacks offer 15 grams of carbs with little prep time: 1 small piece of fresh fruit (4 ounces) 1 slice of bread (1 ounce) or 1 (6-inch) tortilla 1/2 cup of oatmeal 2/3 cup of plain fat-free yogurt or sweetened with sugar substitutes These have 30 grams of carbs: 1/2 peanut butter sandwich (1 slice whole wheat bread with 1 tablespoon peanut butter) and 1 cup milk 1 English muffin and 1 teaspoon low-fat margarine 3/4 cup whole grain, ready-to-eat cereal and 1/2 cup fat-free milk If your reading is below 150 mg/dl and you plan to work out for at least an hour, choose something with protein. These choices have it and less than 5 grams of carbs each: 15 almonds 1 tablespoon peanut butter 1 hard-boiled egg 1 piece of string cheese Many people with diabetes find that snacks with a ratio of 3 grams of carbs to 1 gram of protein work well. There's no need to take a protein supplement. Your food has enough. If you like to work out in the a.m., make sure you eat breakfast first, no matter what your blood sugar is. Exercising on an empty stomach in the morning can raise it. But food sends a signal to your pancreas to make insulin, which keeps it at a safe level. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise. If you're going to head out for a bike trip, marathon, or day-long hike, take some snacks with you. Food may not be easy to carry around if you're in a race. Glucose gels and tablets or sports drinks can be good options. Count the carbs like you would with food. Tip: Your body will absorb carbs more quickly if they're in liquids and gels. This can come in handy if you're going full tilt. Check your blood sugar every hour. How many carbs your snacks should have depends on how much longer you plan to exercise and what your reading says. The idea is to eat enough carbs to keep you from having a low reading or just plain conking out, but not so many that your levels spike. It may take a few tries to figure out the right balance. Test again. If it's less than 100 mg/dl, have a snack. If your next regularly scheduled meal or snack is 30-60 minutes later, 15 grams of carbs should hold you. If your next meal or snack is more than an hour away, have about 15 grams of carbs and 7 or 8 grams of protein. Your sugar level can drop for up to 24 hours after moderate or intense exercise. If it's still below 100 mg/dl at bedtime, double up on your snack. If you take insulin, ask your doctor if it's OK to lower your dose at bedtime. Even if you don't need a snack right after you work out, you'll still need to build your energy back to help your muscles recover. The best time to eat is between 30 minutes and 2 hours after you're done.\n",
      "- Alpha, beta, hydroxy acids, vitamins, and derivatives -- the words on skin care products can be confusing. This simple guide will help you understand the ingredients that may benefit your skin. Then, if you're still unsure which skin care products are right for you, ask your dermatologist or consult with a skin aesthetician at your local salon or beauty counter. Alpha-hydroxy acids include glycolic, lactic, tartaric, malic, and citric acids. They have become increasingly popular over the last 20 years. In the U. S. alone, there are over 200 makers of skin care products containing alpha-hydroxy acids. Creams and lotions with alpha-hydroxy acids may help with fine lines, irregular pigmentation, and age spots. Side effects of alpha-hydroxy acids include mild irritation and sun sensitivity. For that reason, sunscreen should be used every morning. To help avoid skin irritation with alpha-hydroxy acids, it's best to start with a product with low concentrations of AHA. Also, give your skin a chance to get used to the product. Start out by applying AHA skin products every other day, gradually working up to a daily application. Don't use too much; follow the instructions on the package. Salicylic acid exfoliates skin, unclogs pores and can improve its texture and color. It also helps with acne. Many skin care products contain salicylic acid. Some are available over-the-counter and others require a doctor's prescription. Studies have shown that salicylic acid is less irritating than skin care products containing alpha-hydroxy acids but has similar results in improving skin texture and color. Warning: People who are allergic to salycylates (found in aspirin) should not use products containing salicylic acid. Salicylic acid can be absorbed into the bloodstream and may cause an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis. Pregnant or nursing women should not use products containing salicylic acid. Skin care products containing hydroquinone are often called bleaching creams or lightening agents. These skin care products are used to lighten hyperpigmentation, such as age spots and dark spots related to pregnancy or hormone therapy (also called melasma). Some over-the-counter skin care products contain hydroquinone. Your doctor can also prescribe a product with a higher concentration of hydroquinone if your skin doesn't respond to over-the-counter treatments. If you are allergic to hydroquinones, you can use products containing kojic acid or niacinamide (vitamin B3) instead. Pregnant women cannot use hydroquinone. Kojic acid is a more recent remedy for treating pigment problems and age spots. First developed in 1989, kojic acid has a similar effect as hydroquinone. Kojic acid is made from a fungus, and studies have shown that it is effective at lightening skin. Retinol is made from vitamin A, and it's in many non-prescription skin care products. Retinol's stronger counterpart is tretinoin, which is the active ingredient in Retin- A and Renova, available by prescription only. If your skin is too sensitive to use Retin- A, retinol is an alternative, although the effects are less impressive. Retinol may improve mottled pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture, and skin tone and color. You may also hear about retinyl palmitate. This is in the same family as retinol, but if the skin care product you choose contains retinyl palmitate, you will need to use more of this product than one that contains retinol to get the same effect. Pregnant women or nursing mothers cannot use retinol. Vitamin C helps to minimize fine lines, scars, and wrinkles. It's the only antioxidant that is proven to boost production of collagen, which is a key part of skin's structure. Be choosy when selecting a vitamin C product. Vitamin C in its most commonly found forms is highly unstable when exposed to oxygen, making it useless. Choose one in a tube or a pump. Also, many topical vitamin C preparations do not penetrate the skin enough to make a difference. If you are considering using a topical vitamin C preparation, ask your dermatologist which product will be the most effective for you. Skin care products containing hyaluronic acid are often used with vitamin C products to assist in effective penetration. Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally (and quite abundantly) in people and animals and is found in young skin, other tissues, and joint fluid. Hyaluronic acid is part of the body's connective tissues, and is known to cushion and lubricate. Aging destroys hyaluronic acid. Diet and smoking can also affect your body's level of hyaluronic acid over time. Skin care products with hyaluronic acid are most frequently used to treat wrinkled skin although they don't replace anything the body has naturally lost. These are very effective moisturizers. Studies have shown that copper peptide promotes the production of collagen and elastin in your skin. It also acts as an antioxidant and promotes production of glycosaminoglycans (such as hyaluronic acid). Studies have also shown that copper-dependent enzymes help firm, smooth, and soften the skin quicker than most other anti-aging skin care products. In addition, copper peptides have been shown to remove damaged collagen and elastin from the skin and scar tissue. Be wary of these claims, however, since the effects on your skin may be far less than is seen in laboratory testing. Alpha-lipoic acid diminishes fine lines, gives skin a healthy glow, and boosts levels of other antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Alpha-lipoic acid can enter all parts of a skin cell. Due to this quality, it is believed that alpha-lipoic acid can provide more protection than other antioxidants against so-called free radicals that can damage skin. The brain makes DMAE. DMAE in skin care products shows minimal effects at best when applied on skin for the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.\n"
