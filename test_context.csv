0,"Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that lie just below your rib cage, on each side of your spine. They remove waste and fluid from your body, level out your blood pressure, and keep your bones strong. They also ensure that you have the right amount of minerals, like potassium and sodium (salt), in your blood. Finally, they make the hormone that causes your body to create red blood cells. It's a treatment that takes over your kidney functions if those organs stop doing their job. There are two types of dialysis: Hemodialysis: Your blood is put through a filter outside your body, cleaned, and then returned to you. This is done either at a dialysis facility or at home. Peritoneal dialysis: Your blood is cleaned inside your body. A special fluid is put into your abdomen to absorb waste from the blood that passes through small vessels in your abdominal cavity. The fluid is then drained away. This type of dialysis is typically done at home. If your kidney disease becomes very severe and crosses a point where there's not enough function to maintain the body, then you need either a transplant or dialysis. You typically start dialysis when you have symptoms or your lab tests show toxic levels of waste in your blood. Symptoms of kidney failure include nausea, fatigue, swelling, and throwing up. When you should start dialysis depends on your age, energy level, overall health, lab test results and how willing you are to commit to a treatment plan. Although it can make you feel better and live longer, it involves a lot of your time. Your doctor will let you know when you should start treatment. He'll also explain which type might work best for you. First, you'll need minor surgery to create direct access to your bloodstream. This can be done in a few ways: Fistula (also known as arteriovenous fistula or A- V fistula): An artery and vein are joined together under the skin in your arm. Most of the time, this is done in the one you don't write with. An A- V fistula needs 6 weeks or longer to heal before it can be used for hemodialysis. Then, it can be used for many years. Graft (arteriovenous graft or A- V graft): A plastic tube is used to join an artery and vein under your skin. This heals in only 2 weeks, so you can start hemodialysis faster. This won't last as long as a fistula. You'll likely need another graft after a few years. The risk of infection is greater with a graft. You'll also have to see your doctor more often so he can make sure the graft stays open. Catheter (central venous catheter): This method is an option if you need to start hemodialysis very quickly. A flexible tube (catheter) is put into a vein in your neck, below your collarbone, or next to your groin. It's only meant to be used for a short time. During hemodialysis, you'll sit or lie back in a chair. A tech will place two needles in your arm where the fistula or graft is located. A pump in the hemodialysis machine slowly draws out your blood, then sends it through another machine called a dialyzer. This works like a kidney and filters out extra salt, waste, and fluid. Your cleaned blood is sent back into your body through the second needle in your arm. Or, if there's a catheter, blood comes out of one port and then is returned via a second port. You can have hemodialysis in a hospital, a dialysis treatment center, or at home. If you have it in a center, the sessions last 3 to 5 hours, and you'll likely only need them three times a week. If you have hemodialysis at home, you'll need treatments 6 or 7 days for 2 to 3 hours each time. Some people read or watch TV during treatment. If you have hemodialysis at home, you may be able to do it at night while you sleep. It uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood. A few weeks before you start treatment, a catheter is placed near your navel. Once the area heals, you'll be trained on how to do PD since you'll be giving it to yourself. You'll use the catheter to transfer dialysis solution from a bag into your belly. This special fluid contains water with salt and other additives. It soaks up waste and extra fluids inside your body. After a few hours, you'll drain it out into a separate bag. This process is called an âexchange.â There are two kinds of PD: Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis ( CCPD): This uses a machine to do your exchanges. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD): You'll do your exchanges by hand. You'll likely do four to six exchanges each day. Your doctor can help you decide which type fits your lifestyle. Some people do both. It shouldn't hurt. If you have pain during or after treatment, tell your doctor right away. You may have side effects, though. Low blood pressure is common. You could also have nausea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, muscle cramps, or feel very tired. You can lessen side effects by being careful about what you eat and drink. Your doctor can advise how much fluid, protein, and salt you should have. Try to stay away from things that can harm your kidneys, like alcohol, smoking, or illegal drugs. Hemodialysis patients are also at an increased risk for infections. Try these tips to stay healthy: Check your access site daily for redness, pus, and swelling. If you see any, call your doctor. Keep the bandage that covers your catheter clean and dry. Make sure anyone who helps with your treatment washes their hands before and after with soap and water. This treatment should maintain or improve your quality of life. But you can choose not to have it or stop at any time. If you do, make sure to talk to your doctor about other treatments that can help you. Changes to your diet or lifestyle may improve your quality of life. If you want to stop dialysis because you feel depressed or ashamed, your doctor may urge you to speak to a counselor first. Sharing your feelings, taking antidepressants, or doing both of these things may help you make a more informed decision. Dialysis is not for everyone, particularly for the very elderly and those with very severe medical conditions."
1,"Many people with polycythemia vera ( PV) live a normal life with this rare blood cancer under control. The goal is to avoid complications like blood clots, which may happen because PV thickens your blood. To prevent those problems, your doctor will recommend treatments to improve your blood flow and help you feel better. When blood gets thick, it can stick together and form clots inside your veins. This can happen in different places in your body. Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) is a clot in a vein deep inside your leg. Sometimes a clot gets loose and travels through a blood vessel. From there, it can move into your lung and get stuck. This is a pulmonary embolism, and it's an emergency. A clot can also lodge in the brain and cause a stroke. Or it can block a blood vessel in the heart and cause a heart attack. These problems don't happen to everyone who has polycythemia vera. They're more likely if you're older than 60 or have already had a blood clot or complication. You'll want to work with your doctor to get a sense of your risk and how to lower it. Watch for signs of a clot, such as: Chest pain Shortness of breath Dizziness Pain and swelling in your leg Call your doctor or go to an emergency room right away if you have these signs. It could be something else, but you need to find out ASAP. A blood clot can also form in the main blood vessel that leads to the liver. This rare condition is called Budd- Chiari syndrome. Its symptoms may include: Pain in the upper right part of your belly Yellow color in your skin and the whites of your eyes Swelling in the belly or arms Bleeding in your digestive tract, from the esophagus or gut To prevent clots, your doctor will remove a small amount of blood with a treatment called phlebotomy. This is similar to giving blood during a blood drive. You may also get medicines like low-dose aspirin, hydroxyurea, or interferon alfa to thin your blood and stop your body from making too many blood cells. Blood carries oxygen around your body. When PV slows blood flow, it's hard for oxygen to reach your organs. Signs that your body isn't getting enough oxygen include: Fatigue Weakness Headache Dizziness Shortness of breath Ringing in your ears Vision changes, such as flashes of light Chest pain PV treatments can improve blood flow and oxygen transport to prevent these symptoms. Sometimes polycythemia vera prompts your body to make extra platelets. Platelets normally help your blood clot, but the extra ones in PV don't always work well. They prevent your blood from clotting the way it should. Some people with this condition bleed too easily. They may have: Bleeding gums A bleeding ulcer or other bleeding in the GI tract Nosebleeds Bruises or pooled blood under the skin If you take aspirin to prevent clots, it could make the bleeding worse. Your doctor might need to change your medicine until the bleeding is under control. Some people with PV -- about 4 out of 10 -- have itchy skin. Many things can cause itching. With PV, it can happen because the extra red blood cells prompt your immune system to release a chemical called histamine. This is the same chemical your body releases during an allergic reaction. Histamine makes your skin itch. To prevent itchiness: Keep the water cool when you shower or take a bath. Gently pat your skin dry when you get out of the water. Don't rub it dry. Use moisturizer every day. Your doctor may recommend an antihistamine or low-dose aspirin. A rise in histamine levels also causes your stomach to make more acid. This acid can leave sores called peptic ulcers in the lining of your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine. When you have PV, these are about 3 to 5 times more likely than in other people. If you get an ulcer, you'll likely have stomach pain, along with nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of fullness. You may also feel fatigued and have dark, tarry stools. Doctors treat ulcers and prevent new ones from forming with medicines that curb acid production, such as proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers. Your spleen is in the upper left part of your belly. One of its main jobs is to recycle old red blood cells. PV makes the spleen work harder to remove all the extra blood cells. All that extra work makes the spleen grow bigger. About 3 out of 4 people with PV have an enlarged spleen. Doctors call this âsplenomegaly.â If your spleen is enlarged, you may have symptoms like: A feeling of fullness Swelling in your belly Weight loss Stomach pain If your enlarged spleen causes problems, you may need to take medicine for it, or you may need surgery to remove it. Gout is a type of arthritis. It's caused by the buildup of uric acid in your joints. Uric acid forms into hard crystals that leave the joints sore and swollen. You get gout when cells turn over too quickly in your body -- like in PV. Signs of gout include swelling and pain in your joints, especially in your big toe. Your doctor can prescribe medicines such as allopurinol to control gout and prevent future attacks. After years of pumping out extra red blood cells, your bone marrow can become so filled with scar tissue that it can't make enough blood cells to meet your body's needs. Doctors call this condition myelofibrosis. It's rare, but abnormal bone marrow cells grow out of control. This can lead to acute myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Again, these problems aren't likely. Your doctor will closely follow your health to make sure you're doing well and staying free of complications."
2,"Supplements can help your bones, your muscles, and many other parts of your body. What about your heart? Research shows that some of them may help lower cholesterol, improve blood pressure, and other things that put you at risk for heart disease. It's unclear, though, if they help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. Here are six nutrients that can be a good addition to your heart-healthy lifestyle. Fiber. Found naturally in fruits, grains, vegetables, and legumes, fiber cuts down the amount of cholesterol your body soaks up from food. Try to get at least 25 to 30 grams of it every day. Men less than age 51 should aim for 38 grams a day. It's best to get your daily dose from your diet, but supplements are another option. There's good evidence that blond psyllium husk -- common in fiber supplements -- can lower âbadâ LDL cholesterol. It can also raise the âgoodâ kind, HDL. Other fiber supplements include methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil.. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly. This can help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake. Sterols and stanols. Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements. They reduce the amount of cholesterol that your body absorbs from food. They're also added to many foods, such as some margarines, orange juice, and yogurts. Experts recommend 2 grams a day to help lower LDL cholesterol for people who have high cholesterol. Coenzyme Q10 ( Co Q10 ). Your body naturally makes small amounts of this enzyme, also known as ubiquinone and ubiquinol. As a supplement, Co Q10 may help lower blood pressure, either on its own or along with medications. Other studies have found that adding it to heart failure drugs may help people feel better day to day. Co Q10 pills are also popular as a treatment for the side effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. Why? These meds can sometimes lower the amount of Co Q10 the body makes on its own. Some doctors suggest adding a Co Q10 supplement to make up for the loss, hoping it will relieve problems like muscle pain and weakness. But study results have been mixed. Fish oil . Full of omega-3 fatty acids, it can slash levels of triglycerides -- an unhealthy fat in your blood -- by up to 30%. It may also improve blood pressure. But it's not clear if non-prescription fish oil supplements lower your risk of heart attack and stroke. Your best bet may be to eat fish with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends that all adults eat at least two 3.5-ounce servings of fish a week. Garlic. Not only does it make just about anything taste delicious, it could also slightly lower blood pressure. It may slow the buildup of plaque in your arteries, lowering your risk of blood clots. Research shows that both garlic in food and in supplements may help. Green tea . Research shows that both the extract and the drink may lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and raise HDL levels. Don't take a supplement just because it's labeled ""heart healthy."" Not all of them are guaranteed to help you, and it can be dangerous to get too much of some of them. Pay attention to what the supplement does, and make sure you really need it. Ask your doctor which product is most likely to help. If you have a heart condition or for a high risk for a heart attack, you must follow your doctor's advice. It's way too risky to try to treat a serious health condition on your own with over-the-counter supplements."
3,"Statins lower cholesterol for millions of people. They also can help protect you from heart attacks and strokes. But for some people who take them, they don't work well enough. If your statin doesn't help, don't worry. Your doctor can help you find other treatments. But first, she'll give you a few tests to see why the statin didn't work and how much extra help you need. Then, you and your doctor will talk about all of your risk factors and your preferences to come up with your new treatment plan. One of the first things your doctor will do is talk with you more about your family history. You can tell her more about any heart problems that your parents or siblings have had in the past. If your father or a brother had a heart attack before age 55, or if your mother or a sister had a heart attack before age 65, your chances of heart disease are higher. If your family history puts you at higher risk, your doctor may decide to prescribe either a higher dose of your statin or add another cholesterol drug. Blood tests can give your doctor a better idea of why your statins aren't working well, or why you have side effects from them. Muscle pain or dark urine are signals that your medication might be damaging your muscles. If that's the case, one type of blood test will show that you have a higher amount of a substance called creatine kinase ( CK). Your doctor may also check your amount of âbadâ LDL cholesterol to see if the statins aren't working. He may ask about your diet and whether you drink alcohol to see if they're boosting your LDL cholesterol. Inflammation may be linked to high cholesterol. Your doctor can look for subtle signs of it in your blood, including one called the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs- CRP). If your hs- CRP levels are 2 mg/ L or higher, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of your statin or another drug. Your doctor may test your thyroid gland, too. If it's not making enough hormones, a condition called hypothyroidism, it may cause muscle pain when you take statins. A high cholesterol level is one of the main things that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. When your doctor is thinking about how to bring your levels down, she might use a few different tests to check how high your risk is for these problems. That will help her decide what changes to make to your treatment plan. Carotid ultrasound. Two of the major blood vessels in your neck are your carotid arteries. When they have thick, fatty deposits of cholesterol inside, it's a sign you're at higher risk for a heart attack or stroke. Your doctor might do an ultrasound scan of your neck called a carotid intima-media thickness test to check them out. Coronary calcium scan. This CT scan of your chest can help doctors spot calcium buildup in the arteries around your heart, a sign that they have too much plaque. Ankle brachial index test. High blood pressure is a major sign of heart disease risk. This test measures the blood pressure in your legs. Your doctor will put a blood pressure cuff around your ankles as you lie on a table. It helps your doctor compare your blood pressure in both your legs and your arms. Your total score is the division of your ankle blood pressure reading by your arm blood pressure reading. Scores above 1.4 may mean you have calcium buildup in your blood vessels. Scores below 0.9 are a sign of peripheral artery disease ( PAD). Some people have very high cholesterol because of a problem with one of their genes. This condition is called familial hypercholesterolemia or FH. If you have it, statins may not be able to lower your levels enough. You may need stronger treatment or, in some cases, a liver transplant. A blood test can offer other clues. If your total cholesterol levels are above 300 mg/d L, or if your LDL is above 200 mg/d L, your doctor may run tests to see if you have FH. Your doctor might also study how well your heart works while you walk on a treadmill, called a stress test. If your treatment plan doesn't reduce your cholesterol enough, your doctor might: Change your medication dosage Try a stronger statin Add or switch to another type of cholesterol drug Suggest changes to your lifestyle, such as diet or exercise"
4,"A clinical trial is a research study conducted with patients to evaluate a new arthritis treatment, drug, or device. The purpose of clinical trials is to find new and improved methods of treating arthritis. Clinical trials make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances in arthritis to patient care. During a clinical trial, doctors use the best available arthritis treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. The new treatments are considered to be at least as effective or possibly more effective than the standard. New treatment options are first researched in a laboratory where they are carefully studied in the test tube and in animals. Only the treatments most likely to work are further evaluated in a small group of humans prior to applying them in a larger clinical trial. When a new arthritis treatment is studied for the first time in humans, it is not known exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to the following questions: Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work? Clinical trials are conducted in phases, each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous phases. In a phase I clinical trial, the new arthritis treatment being investigated is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely. Phase II clinical trials determine the effect of the research treatment on patients and usually the best dosage. In Phase III clinical trials, the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. The advantages of participating in a clinical trial include the following: You may receive a new arthritis treatment before it is widely available to the public. You can provide researchers with the information they need to continue developing new procedures and introducing new treatment methods. Your arthritis treatment costs may be decreased, since many of the tests and doctor visits that are directly related to the clinical trial are paid for by the company or agency sponsoring the study. Be sure to discuss your treatment costs with the doctors and nurses conducting the clinical trial. Potential side effects from participating in a clinical trial will depend on the type of treatment and the patient's condition. All of the risks and side effects of the treatment being researched are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. Since this is the case, there may be unknown side effects, as well as hoped-for benefits. It's important to note that most arthritis treatments -- as well as the disease or condition itself -- have potential side effects. Patients will be informed of any known, possible side effects as well as any ""new"" side effects that occur or become known while they are participating in the trial. There are some differences in receiving arthritis treatment in a clinical trial vs. receiving regular treatment. You may receive more exams and tests than are usually given for your particular condition. The purpose of these tests is to follow your progress and collect study data. Of course, tests can carry certain benefits and risks or discomforts of their own. Although they can be inconvenient, these tests can assure an extra ounce of observation along the way. Depending on the type of clinical trial you are participating in, you may be asked to stop or change medications you are currently taking. You may also be asked to change your diet or any activities that may affect the outcome of the trial. Some clinical trials are double-blind, placebo-controlled. This means that the clinical trial participants may receive the real drug or an inactive substance that looks exactly like the drug (called a placebo). Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which drug the patient is receiving. This is done to make certain that the real drug is effective. Clinical trial participants are willing volunteers. Even though patients may be asked by their doctors to take part in a clinical trial, it is up to each patient to make the final decision. Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The doctors and nurses conducting the trial will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks. You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the doctor or nurse to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse to sign the consent form. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way. Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments. The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial. Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate. In some instances, you may be required to undergo certain tests to confirm your acceptance. Every patient faces a new world of medical terms and procedures. Fears and myths of ""experimentation"" or ""being a guinea pig"" are common concerns of arthritis patients who are thinking about participating in a clinical trial. Even though there are always going to be fears of the unknown, understanding what is involved in a clinical trial before agreeing to participate can relieve some of your anxieties. Here's some information that may help ease your concerns: The personal information gathered about you during the clinical trial will remain confidential and will not be reported with your name attached. If at any time during the trial your doctor feels it is in your best interest to exit the trial and use other known treatments, you will be free to do so. This will not in any way affect your future arthritis treatment. Clinical trial participants typically receive their care in the same places that the standard arthritis treatments are given -- in clinics or doctors' offices. Clinical trial participants will be watched closely and data on their case will be carefully recorded and reviewed. If you are thinking about taking part in a clinical trial, find out as much as possible about the study before you decide to participate. Here are some important questions to ask: What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests given? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? Are there standard treatment options for my arthritis, and how does the study treatment compare with them? How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? ( Note: There can also be side effects from standard arthritis treatments and from the disease itself.) How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require extra time on my part? Will I have to be hospitalized? If so, how often and for how long? If I agree to withdraw from the clinical trial, will my care be affected? Will I need to change doctors?"
5,"If you're ready to add probiotics to your diet, you have a lot of options. Now that more research shows these ""good bacteria"" may help with digestive problems, you just need to know where to find them. One common source is supplements. You can buy them as tablets, capsules, powders, or liquids. Look for them in health food stores, grocery stores, drugstores, and online. You can also find probiotics in many foods. Yogurt is the most well-known source, but they're also in: Dairy foods like buttermilk, some soft cheeses, fermented milk, and kefir Soy drinks and products like miso and tempeh Kimchi, sauerkraut, and many pickles Many types of bacteria are probiotics. Each has its own benefits, so talk to your doctor about which one might help you the most. For example, different strains of lactobacillus bacteria, found in some yogurts, can help with some types of diarrhea. If you choose yogurt or another dairy food, look on the label for the phrase ""contains live active cultures"" or ""contains probiotics."" Not all yogurts have them. Some frozen yogurts have live cultures and some do not. If you go with a supplement, know that the FDA regulates these products but treats them like foods and not medications. Unlike drug manufacturers, supplement makers don't have to show their products are safe or effective to sell them. That means that these firms are in charge of checking the safety and labeling of their products before they sell them to make sure they meet FDA rules. How a probiotic works can vary from brand to brand. That's why it's key to get as much info as you can before you buy. Here are some things you should be able to find on the label: The genus, species, and strain of the probiotic ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, for example) The number of organisms that will be alive by the use-by date The dose The company name and contact information If you can't find this on the label, you may be able to find it on the company's website. While you're there, look for studies that back up the product's health claims. Some companies have been around for years, and you may know their names. Those that have made probiotics for a while may be more likely to have tested and studied them over and over. It's smarter to choose a product from a reputable maker. Check a third-party certifier (like Consumer Lab or the USP) to see if they have tested the product and found that it's safe and reliable. If you're in doubt, ask your doctor. If your doctor has suggested probiotics, follow his instructions. If you stop taking them, the good effects will end within a couple of weeks. If you have questions, it's always a good idea to ask your doctor. Probiotic-rich foods, like yogurt, can become a part of a healthy diet, too."
6,"You should work with your doctor to treat any thyroid problem. For thyroid disorders stemming from the over- or under-production of thyroid hormones, you want to try to restore the hormone levels to their proper balance. Hyperthyroidism needs treatment that will slow down the making of thyroid hormone, while hypothyroidism needs hormone replacement. Drugs and surgery are usually effective ways to adjust hormone levels. Other treatments, including diet supplements, herbal remedies, and special exercises, may relieve some of the discomfort and help the thyroid gland work better. Before she decides which treatment is best for you, your doctor will consider your particular thyroid condition as well as your age, general health, and past medical issues. Your doctor can diagnose hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism by testing the levels of thyroid hormones in your blood. The tests measure hormones from the thyroid itself, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH), a chemical released by the pituitary gland that triggers your thyroid. When you are hypothyroid, you have higher TSH levels because your body is trying to tell your thyroid to make more hormones. The reverse is true with hyperthyroidism: TSH levels are below normal and thyroid hormone levels are high. One uncommon type of thyroid cancer can be diagnosed through a blood test that measures levels of a hormone called calcitonin that's needed to build bones. Doctors often use this to identify the cause of hyperthyroidism. It tracks the amount of iodide absorbed by the thyroid gland. We get this mineral from the foods we eat. It's a key ingredient of thyroid hormone, so the amount of iodide your thyroid absorbs is a good way to tell how much hormone the gland is making. First, the doctor places a device over your neck to measure how much background radioactivity there is. Then, you swallow a small amount of radioactive iodide in a liquid or as a capsule. After a time, usually 4-6 hours and at most 24 hours, she takes another measurement to see how much of the radioactive iodide has gathered in your thyroid. When the gland has a lot of iodide, the doctor may do a radioactive iodide uptake scan. She'll use a special film to make a picture that shows the exact location of the radioactive iodide in your thyroid. Iodide collecting in nodules suggests that they're responsible for the extra hormone. If the scan shows that the iodide is spread throughout the gland, the whole thyroid is involved. Nodules that appear suddenly are typically fluid-filled sacs. Your doctor can check them with an ultrasound exam. Depending on a nodule's size, how it looks on ultrasound, and your chances for getting thyroid cancer, your doctor may do an aspiration or biopsy, She'll take a tissue sample of the nodule and examine it. Further tests will show if the nodule has the potential to become cancerous. You should get regular checkups when you have a nodule on your thyroid gland. Although subacute thyroiditis can bring on temporary hyperthyroidism, this condition doesn't require medical treatment. You can take acetaminophen or aspirin for any pain from the inflamed thyroid. ( Children under age 19 shouldn't take aspirin because it's been linked to Reye's syndrome.) If over-the-counter drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs like prednisone or dexamethasone for a short time. Thyroid hormone production can be slowed or stopped completely with: Radioactive iodide treatment Anti-thyroid medication Surgery If your doctor decides that radioactive treatment is best, you'll swallow a tablet or liquid with enough radioactive iodide to damage the cells of your thyroid gland so they can't make hormones. Sometimes you'll need more than one treatment to cut back hormone production to a normal level. Many people develop hypothyroidism as a result of this procedure. After you start using anti-thyroid medications, your symptoms should begin to disappear in about 6-8 weeks. But you'll typically need to keep taking the medication for about a year. At that time, your doctor will check to see if you can stop. You'll need regular checkups once you're off the medicine to make sure your hormone levels stay balanced. Doctors don't usually do surgery unless you're pregnant (and can't take anti-thyroid medicine) or have a large goiter or cancerous nodule. Someone with hypothyroidism will have to take thyroid hormone replacement for the rest of his/her life. No surgery, drugs, or complementary medicine can boost your thyroid once it slows down. Doctors generally prescribe man-made forms of thyroid hormone, such as levothyroxine. Side effects are rare, but some people have nervousness or chest pain while taking these drugs. Adjusting the dose of medication usually gets rid of any unpleasant effects. Let your doctor know about everything you're taking, because some things could affect how well the medication works: Diabetes Antidepressants Estrogen in hormone replacement therapy or birth control The blood-thinning drug warfarin The heart drug digitalis Supplements and products with magnesium, aluminum, iron, or soy The first way to treat thyroid cancer is usually by removing either the cancerous tissue or the whole thyroid gland, a surgical procedure known as a thyroidectomy. If the cancer has spread, any other affected tissue, such as the lymph glands in the neck, will be removed, too. Some people try other therapies to cleanse the body, restore immune function, and balance the production and release of hormones. You should talk to your doctor if you're interested in these other methods to make sure they won't harm you or interfere with your treatment. A naturopath may use homeopathic mixtures, herbs, preparations based on traditional Chinese medicine (which links thyroid problems to emotional distress), and acupuncture to remove blocks to your ''life force energy.'' Naturopaths are authorized to treat thyroid disease in some states, but in others, it's illegal. While they may help with the stress associated with thyroid disease, there are no good studies showing that these therapies are effective for treating thyroid disorders. Chiropractors use spinal manipulation to treat symptoms of thyroid disorders by easing muscle tension and improving blood circulation. Protein, calcium, magnesium, and iodine help your thyroid work. Make sure you're getting plenty of all the B vitamins, vitamin A, and vitamin C. If you don't have enough iodine in your system, taking selenium can cause hypothyroidism. Avoid these products: Pseudoephedrine (found in over-the-counter cold remedies) can cause nervousness, insomnia, headache, and high blood pressure. Alkaloids, including caffeine, morphine, and quinine, can raise your blood pressure and heart rate."
7,"These days, many of us have jobs that require us to stare at computer screens for hours at a time. That can put a real strain on your eyes. Eye problems caused by computer use fall under the heading computer vision syndrome ( CVS). It isn't one specific problem. Instead, it includes a whole range of eye strain and discomfort. Research shows that between 50% and 90% of people who work at a computer screen have at least some symptoms. Working adults aren't the only ones affected. Kids who stare at tablets or use computers during the day at school can have issues, too, especially if the lighting and their posture are less than ideal. CVS is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive motion injuries you might get at work. It happens because your eyes follow the same path over and over. And it can get worse the longer you continue the movement. When you work at a computer, your eyes have to focus and refocus all the time. They move back and forth as you read. You may have to look down at papers and then back up to type. Your eyes react to images constantly moving and changing, shifting focus, sending rapidly varying images to the brain. All these jobs require a lot of effort from your eye muscles. And to make things worse, unlike a book or piece of paper, the screen adds contrast, flicker, and glare. What's more, it is proven that we blink far less frequently when using a computer, which causes the eyes to dry out and blur your vision periodically while working. You're more likely to have problems if you already have eye trouble, if you need glasses but don't have them, or if you wear the wrong prescription for computer use. Computer work gets harder as you age and the natural lenses in your eyes becomes less flexible. Somewhere around age 40, your ability to focus on near and far objects will start to go away. Your eye doctor will call this condition presbyopia. There's no proof that computer use causes any long-term damage to the eyes. But regular use can lead to eye strain and discomfort. You may notice: Blurred vision Double vision Dry, red eyes Eye irritation Headaches Neck or back pain If you don't do anything about them, it could affect more than your eyes. You could also have issues with your work performance. A few simple changes to your workspace can improve your symptoms and prevent new problems: Cut the glare. Change the lighting around you to reduce the effect on your computer screen. If light from a nearby window casts a glare, move your monitor and close the shades. Ask your employer to install a dimmer switch for the overhead fixtures if they're too bright, or buy a desk lamp with a moveable shade that casts light evenly over your desk. You can also add a glare filter to your monitor. Rearrange your desk. The best position for your monitor is slightly below eye level, about 20 to 28 inches away from your face. You shouldn't have to stretch your neck or strain your eyes to see what's on the screen. Put a stand next to your monitor and place any printed materials you're working from on it. That way, you won't have to look up at the screen and back down at the desk while you type. Give your eyes a break. Follow the 20-20-20 rule. Look away from the screen every 20 minutes or so and look at something around 20 feet away for about 20 seconds. Blink often to keep your eyes moist. If they feel dry, try some eye drops. Tweak your settings. You don't have to live with the factory-installed presets if you're uncomfortable. Adjust the brightness, contrast, and font size until you find what's best for you. Visit your eye doctor regularly for exams and to keep your prescriptions up to date. Let him know about any problems you have. You may need glasses or contact lenses. He'll decide if you can wear your regular glasses for computer work or if you need a special pair. He might prescribe a single or bifocal lens, or tinted lens material to boost contrast and filter out glare. Get your kids' eyes checked, too. Make sure any computers they use are set up at the right height and in the best light. Encourage them to take frequent breaks from the screen to give their eyes a rest."
8,"One of the goals when you take drugs for high blood pressure is to be sure the medication is working effectively. One step toward achieving this goal is to avoid some medications. What kinds of problems might other drugs cause? Some drugs can make blood pressure rise. If you have high blood pressure to begin with, it can rise to dangerous levels. Some medications may interact with blood pressure medicine. This can prevent either drug from working properly. Here are common types of medication that can make high blood pressure worse. NSAIDs -- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- include both prescription and over-the-counter varieties. They are often used to relieve pain or reduce inflammation from conditions such as arthritis. However, NSAIDs can make the body retain fluid and decrease kidney function. This may cause blood pressure to rise even higher, putting greater stress on your heart and kidneys. Common NSAIDs include: Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen You may also find NSAIDs in over-the-counter medication for other health problems. Cold medicine, for example, often contains NSAIDs. It's a good idea whenever you purchase an over-the-counter drug to check the label for NSAIDs. Ask your doctor if any NSAID is OK for you to use. Your doctor may be able to recommend alternatives, such as using acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen. Many cough and cold medications contain NSAIDs to relieve pain. NSAIDs may increase your blood pressure. Cough and cold medicines also frequently contain decongestants. Decongestants can make blood pressure worse in two ways: Decongestants may make your blood pressure and heart rate rise. Decongestants may prevent high blood pressure drugs from working properly. What can you do? Avoid using cough and cold medicine that contains NSAIDs or decongestants. Ask your doctor for suggestions about other ways to ease symptoms of cold, flu, or sinus problems. Some migraine headache drugs work by tightening blood vessels in your head. This relieves migraine pain. However, the medication also constricts blood vessels throughout your body. This can make blood pressure rise, perhaps to dangerous levels. If you have high blood pressure or any other type of heart disease, talk with your doctor before taking medication for migraines or severe headaches. Some weight loss drugs may make heart disease worse. Appetite suppressants tend to ""rev"" up the body, increasing both the heart rate and the blood pressure. When the blood pressure rises, it can put more stress on your heart. Before using any weight loss drug, whether prescription or over-the-counter, be sure to check with your doctor. These medications may do you more harm than good. Be sure any medications you choose to use are safe for people who have high blood pressure. These suggestions can help: Give a list of ALL the medications you use, both prescription and over-the-counter, to every doctor you visit, including dosages. Read medication labels before buying over-the-counter preparations. Make sure the medicine doesn't contain ingredients that could make your high blood pressure worse, such as NSAIDs or decongestants. Talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medication, herbal preparation, vitamins, or other nutritional supplements. Ask for alternatives to potentially harmful medicines."
9," Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum, the tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers and supports most of your abdominal organs. Peritonitis is usually caused by infection from bacteria or fungi. Left untreated, peritonitis can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) and to other organs, resulting in multiple organ failure and death. So if you develop any of the symptoms of peritonitis -- the most common of which is severe abdominal pain -- it's essential to seek prompt medical evaluation and treatment that can prevent potentially fatal complications. The first symptoms of peritonitis are typically poor appetite and nausea and a dull abdominal ache that quickly turns into persistent, severe abdominal pain, which is worsened by any movement. Other signs and symptoms related to peritonitis may include: Abdominal tenderness or distention Chills Fever Fluid in the abdomen Not passing any urine, or passing significantly less urine than usual Difficulty passing gas or having a bowel movement Vomiting The two main types of peritonitis are primary spontaneous peritonitis, an infection that develops in the peritoneum; and secondary peritonitis, which usually develops when an injury or infection in the abdominal cavity allows infectious organisms into the peritoneum. Both types of peritonitis are life-threatening. The death rate from peritonitis depends on many factors, but can be as high as 40% in those who also have cirrhosis. As many as 10% may die from secondary peritonitis. The most common risk factors for primary spontaneous peritonitis include: Liver disease with cirrhosis . Such disease often causes a buildup of abdominal fluid (ascites) that can become infected. Kidney failure getting peritoneal dialysis. This technique, which involves the implantation of a catheter into the peritoneum, is used to remove waste products in the blood of people with kidney failure. It's linked to a higher risk of peritonitis due to accidental contamination of the peritoneum by way of the catheter. Common causes of secondary peritonitis include: A ruptured appendix, diverticulum, or stomach ulcer Digestive diseases such as Crohn's disease and diverticulitis Pancreatitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Perforations of the stomach, intestine, gallbladder, or appendix Surgery Trauma to the abdomen, such as an injury from a knife or gunshot wound Noninfectious causes of peritonitis include irritants such as bile, blood, or foreign substances in the abdomen, such as barium. If you have any symptoms of peritonitis, call your doctor right away. Seeking prompt medical attention is especially important for peritoneal dialysis patients who have a combination of abdominal pain and a clouding of the peritoneal fluid, which is caused by a buildup of infection-fighting white blood cells. Because peritonitis can rapidly lead to potentially fatal complications such as sepsis and septic shock, which causes a massive drop in blood pressure, organ failure, and death, it's essential to receive a quick diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and conduct a thorough physical examination, including assessment of tension and tenderness in the abdomen. Diagnostic tests for peritonitis may include: Blood and urine tests Imaging studies such as X-rays and computerized tomography ( CT) scans Exploratory surgery Your doctor also may perform a paracentesis, a procedure in which fluid from the abdominal cavity is withdrawn through a thin needle and checked for infection. Paracentesis is useful for identifying primary spontaneous peritonitis and secondary peritonitis caused by pancreatitis. If you're diagnosed with peritonitis, you'll be admitted to a hospital. Typically, you'll immediately start receiving intravenous antibiotics or antifungal medications to treat the infection. Additional supportive treatments will be necessary if organ failure from sepsis develops as a complication of the infection. Such treatments may include intravenous fluids, drugs to maintain blood pressure, and nutritional support. If you have peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, you may receive medications that are injected directly into the peritoneal tissue, a strategy that some studies have reported to be more effective than intravenous medications. Until the peritonitis is cured, you will need to use another method of dialysis, such as hemodialysis. In many cases, emergency surgery is required, especially if peritonitis has been caused by conditions such as appendicitis, a perforated stomach ulcer, or diverticulitis. Infected tissue such as a burst appendix or abscess will be surgically removed. So will any part of the peritoneal tissue that has been seriously damaged by infection. During your hospitalization, you will be closely monitored for signs of sepsis and septic shock, which usually require immediate transfer to an intensive care unit. For select people with cirrhosis and ascites, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to prevent peritonitis. Although peritonitis can be a complication of peritoneal dialysis, it's much less common than it used to be because of improved technology and self-care techniques that are taught during initial training. If you're receiving peritoneal dialysis, you can lower your risk of peritonitis by following these tips: Thoroughly wash your hands, including the areas between your fingers and under your fingernails, before touching the catheter. Wear a mouth/nose mask during exchanges. Observe the proper sterile exchange technique. Apply an antibiotic cream to the catheter exit site every day. Immediately report any possible contamination of your dialysis fluid or catheter to your peritoneal dialysis nurse. In many cases, a single dose of antibiotics can prevent a contamination from turning into an infection."
10,"Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, put nicotine into your lungs and bloodstream. And they do it without the smoke and tar of a regular cigarette. But other harmful things can get into your body when you vape. That's especially true if you use flavored cigarettes. E-cigarettes, sometimes called vapes, run on batteries and heat up nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. They turn them into a vapor you can breathe in. Many chemicals that cause cancer are in this vapor. That includes formaldehyde, heavy metals, and particles that can get stuck in the deepest parts of your lungs. It's hard to know how much of these chemicals you breathe in when you vape. The levels are usually lower in e-cigarettes than regular cigarettes. But some studies show that high-voltage e-cigarettes have more formaldehyde and other toxins than standard e-cigarettes. Also, some chemicals in e-cigarettes can irritate the airways in your lungs. This can cause problems. Studies have found that flavorings like cinnamon can cause inflammation of lung cells. But more research is needed to understand the long-term health risks of vaping. One chemical in some e-cigarette flavorings is a buttery-flavored one called diacetyl. It's been linked to a serious lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans. It's also known as popcorn lung. The disease gets its name because people working in a microwave popcorn factory got sick with serious lung problems from breathing in diacetyl. It was being used to flavor popcorn, caramel, and dairy products. The way the chemical is breathed in with e-cigarettes is a lot like the way the workers at the microwave popcorn plants inhaled it. The chemical can cause a dry cough that won't go away. It also causes shortness of breath, wheezing, headache, fever, aches, and other health problems. The vapors also can irritate your eyes, skin, nose, and throat. Diacetyl scars the tiny airs sacs in your lungs. That makes your airways thick and narrow. After the link between diacetyl and lung disease was found, many popcorn companies took the chemical out of their products. But it's still used in many e-cigarette flavors, including vanilla, maple, and coconut. It's also been found in many alcohol-flavored, candy-flavored, and fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. These are choices that often appeal to kids, teenagers, and young adults. There's no cure for popcorn lung, but some medications can help keep it from getting worse. These include certain kinds of antibiotics, steroids to calm inflammation in your lungs, and drugs to slow down your immune system."
11,"When your doctor tells you that you have prediabetes, you might think there's no reason to take action just yet. Or you might assume that you're definitely going to get diabetes. Not so! You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there's still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That's what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you're overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you're not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don't. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight. If you take metformin, you'll need to follow up with your doctor. You'll also need to keep up a healthy lifestyle. Take action now, and ask for extra help from your doctor, a nutritionist, or personal trainer if you need it."
12,"Are you searching for what causes osteoporosis? You may be surprised to learn that many factors contribute to the condition. For instance, a decrease in estrogen at menopause is one cause. There is also a genetic component. If your mother or grandmother had osteoporosis, the chances are higher that you will develop it, too. Eating a diet that's low in calcium, getting little exercise, and smoking cigarettes can also increase your chances of getting osteoporosis. It's important to know all you can about what causes osteoporosis. Then you can take preventive steps to stop this disease and lower your risk of bone fractures. In childhood and adolescence, the body constantly breaks down old bone and rebuilds new bone. It does this through a process called ""remodeling."" During this time, the body builds more bone than it removes, and so bones grow and get stronger. You often hear how important it is for women to get enough calcium. But it's just as important -- maybe even more important -- that kids and teens get ample bone-boosting calcium. It's also important for them to exercise daily to build strong bones. For most women, the total amount of bone peaks somewhere between ages 25 and 30. It may peak even sooner for some women, depending on their risk factors for osteoporosis. When the total amount of bone peaks, the tide turns. At some point, usually around age 35, women start to lose bone. While some bone is lost each year, the rate of bone loss increases dramatically in the five to 10 years after menopause. Then, for several years, the breakdown of bone occurs at a much greater pace than the building of new bone. This is the process that eventually causes osteoporosis. During this time, even though your bones may still be strong enough to prevent unusual fractures and you have no signs to alert you to the disease, bone loss may become detectable with a bone density test. Yes. Men get osteoporosis. In fact, about 2 million men over age 65 have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis usually starts later and progresses more slowly in men. Still, osteoporosis in men can be just as disabling and painful as it is in women. With the aging of America, osteoporosis is becoming increasingly common. Among people ages 50 and older, 55% are at significant risk for osteoporosis. In the U. S., more than 10 million men and women have osteoporosis. And nearly another 34 million are thought to have low bone mass. That places them at increased risk for osteoporosis. The rate of bone loss varies from person to person. But around midlife, bones become thinner. How fast or how slow you lose bone depends on a number of factors Your activity level How much calcium you get Your family history Your history of taking certain medications Your lifestyle habits, such as whether you smoke or how much alcohol you consume The onset of menopause Estrogen is important for maintaining bone density in women. When estrogen levels drop after menopause, bone loss speeds up. This can happen with natural menopause or an early surgical menopause if you have your ovaries removed. During the first five to 10 years after menopause, women can lose about 2.5% of bone density each year. That means they can lose as much as 25% of their bone density during that time. Accelerated bone loss after menopause is a major cause of osteoporosis in women. For women, having the strongest bones possible before you enter menopause is the best protection against debilitating fractures. About half of all women over age 50 and about one in four men will break a bone due to osteoporosis. But there are many things you can do to prevent osteoporosis and avoid painful fractures. For instance, make sure you get plenty of calcium in your daily diet. You can get calcium from both foods and supplements. You can also check your osteoporosis risk factors and change those you can control. For example, stop smoking if you are a smoker. If you need them, your health care provider can make recommendations about using osteoporosis medications. A very important thing you can do is be sure to get plenty of exercise. Weight-bearing exercises stimulate the cells that make new bone. By increasing weight-bearing exercises, you encourage your body to form more bone. This can delay or even reverse the destructive process of osteoporosis that results in painful or debilitating fractures. By adding strength training to your exercise routine, you improve your muscle strength and flexibility and reduce the likelihood of falling. Talk to your health care provider about suitable exercise options for you."
13,"As many as 18% of women and 6% of men in the U. S. have migraine. Yet despite how common these painful, throbbing headaches are, treatment often remains a challenge. Migraine headaches are complex and still not completely understood. Certain nerves cells and brain chemicals play a role. When blood vessels in your brain get inflamed and swollen, it sets many other changes in motion. In addition to that throbbing pain in your head, you could have problems with your vision, feel very sensitive to noise and light, have diarrhea, or throw up. Every person with migraine has different symptoms. Everyone's triggers are different too, although some common ones include lack of sleep, certain foods, and stress. As doctors learn more about migraine and what parts of the brain are involved, they're finding better ways to prevent these headaches. Right now, there are two methods. Acute treatments: These drugs stop a headache after it starts. A group of drugs called ergots are the oldest treatments for migraine. Triptans, a newer drug, work the same way as ergots but are more powerful. They affect the release of certain brain chemicals and block pain pathways in your brain. Still, these drugs aren't for everyone. If you have uncontrolled high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, a history of strokes, and other heart problems, you probably can't take them. There are risks if you're pregnant. Your doctor will discuss them with you. If you have frequent attacks, your doctor may prescribe a drug to reduce the number of migraines you have. It could also help any acute drugs you take work better. Drugs used to prevent migraines include: Antidepressants: amitriptyline and venlafaxine ( Effexor) Anti-seizure drugs: gabapentin ( Neurontin), topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax, Trokendi XR) and valproate ( Depakote) Beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol CGRP Inhibitors: erenumab ( Aimovig), fremanezumab ( Ajovy), and galcanezumab-gnlm ( Emgality) Although they can offer help, some of these medications were made to treat other health problems. Their effect on migraines was discovered by chance. Some work better for some people than for others, and side effects are common. There are also several devices which can prevent migraines: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS): During this treatment, you'll hold a small device called Spring TMS to the back of your head. It sends a split-second pulse which interrupts abnormal electrical activity caused by migraine, thus aborts the migraine. Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation ( TSNS): Cefaly uses transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation and is worn as a headband on the forehead and turned on daily for 20 minutes to prevent migraine from developing. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (n VS): gamma Core is a n VS and works by being placed placed over the vagus nerve in the neck. It releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain. Doctors keep looking for drugs that do a better job of stopping migraines before they even start. Some treatments in the pipeline include: EP4 receptor antagonists: Prostaglandins are hormones that boost inflammation throughout your body. They're also believed to play a role in migraines. Clinical trials are under way to test drugs that block prostaglandins in people. Although new drugs are on the way to prevent migraines, research continues to show that natural, drug-free techniques help, too. After all, stress is the most common trigger. Studies show that people who learn to better deal with their worries actually start to have fewer migraines. You can try: Biofeedback: This type of therapy teaches you to be aware of how your body reacts to stress, whether that's tense muscles, a fast heart rate, or cold, clammy hands. A trained professional teaches you how to change that response and calm down. Studies show that people who use biofeedback have 55% fewer migraines. This therapy may work even better when you also take medicine that prevents headaches. Progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR): This relaxation technique helps stop your body's response to stress before it triggers a migraine. A therapist will show you to tightly contract, then fully release, each of your muscles. He'll also teach you to deepen and slow your breathing. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT): A psychologist can help you learn how your thoughts and habits affect your migraines. She'll also teach you to change the way your body reacts to the pain you feel during an attack."
14,"Psoriasis can make your skin crawl. It itches. It burns. It hurts. So when a flare turns painful, you want relief -- ASAP. Having some remedies on hand can soothe your sore skin when you need it the most. Before you do anything, make sure you don't have a bigger problem on your hands. If the pain is really bad or your skin is crusty yellow or oozing, call your doctor. That's a sign of an infection. It can spread and become much worse than a regular flare. You may need an antibiotic. Otherwise, try these self-care tips for the pain and itch. Quench thirsty skin. Your psoriasis may be uncomfortable because your skin is dry, scaly, and inflamed. A moisturizer is your friend. Thicker or greasier is usually better. Pick creams and ointments that come in a tub or tube. Lotions, on the other hand, tend to be watered down. Look for moisturizers with an ingredient called ceramide. Even something as basic as petroleum jelly can help your skin and lock in moisture. Soften scales. Lotions with salicylic, lactic, or glycolic acids can break up dead skins cells that build up on psoriasis plaques. Slather it on at night and cover the area with plastic wrap. This helps keep the lotion in place so you skin absorbs it better. Turn up the heat. The ingredient that makes chili peppers hot can ease pain. Check your drugstore for products with capsaicin. This can block nerve endings that transmit pain. One study showed it may help psoriasis pain, redness, swelling and other symptoms. Knock out itch. Several over-the-counter medications can control itch -- which can feel more like a burning or biting feeling when you have psoriasis. Ask your pharmacist for lotions and creams with pramoxine or menthol. Hydrocortisone, a mild steroid, can help, too. Resist the urge to scratch. That only makes it worse and can injure you skin, which makes it hurt even more. Chill out. Cold packs can take the itch out by short-circuiting the itch-scratch cycle. They âconfuseâ your brain because it's hard for it to feel itch and cold at the same time. Take a soak. Draw a warm bath and sprinkle in some Epsom salts. Soak for about 15 minutes. This soothing brew helps remove scales and eases itch. Oatmeal baths can take the tickle out, too. After your bath, pat your skin dry and put on moisturizer right away. Thinking outside the box may do you some good. Consider these non-mainstream therapies to put the brakes on discomfort and improve your psoriasis. Wash with vinegar. Apple cider vinegar can help soothe itchy scalp psoriasis. Massage it into your scalp a few times a week. If it burns your head, use a half water-half vinegar mixture. Or rinse your scalp after the vinegar dries to prevent irritation. If it's going to work, you should see results in about 2 weeks. Take a pass if your scalp is cracked or bleeding. Needle your pain. Acupuncture stimulates specific points on your body, most often with thin needles inserted into the skin. It's often used to treat pain. In China and elsewhere in Asia, it's widely used for psoriasis. Some studies show acupuncture doesn't make a meaningful difference, while others find it helps. One recent study found that acupuncture therapies were simple, effective, and had few side effects. Run it by your doctor before you get acupuncture. Relax. Stress is a trigger for psoriasis. So try to find ways to relax if you have it. Meditation can relieve anxiety. Sit comfortably on the floor with your eyes closed. For 15 minutes, put all other thoughts out of your mind, and just focus on your breathing. You can use an app, too. Exercise boosts your mood and can fight anxiety. One big study found that women who exercise vigorously are less likely to get psoriasis than women who are less active. Remember, self-care remedies don't replace your doctor's treatment plan. Call her if your psoriasis gets worse, you're depressed, your skin is red all over, or your joints hurt."
15,"Antibiotics are medicines that help stop infections caused by bacteria. They do this by killing the bacteria or by keeping them from copying themselves or reproducing. The word antibiotic means âagainst life.â Any drug that kills germs in your body is technically an antibiotic. But most people use the term when they're talking about medicine that is meant to kill bacteria. Before scientists first discovered antibiotics in the 1920s, many people died from minor bacterial infections, like strep throat. Surgery was riskier, too. But after antibiotics became available in the 1940s, life expectancy increased, surgeries got safer, and people could survive what used to be deadly infections. Most bacteria that live in your body are harmless. Some are even helpful. Still, bacteria can infect almost any organ. Fortunately, antibiotics can usually help. These are the types of infections that can be treated with antibiotics: Some ear and sinus infections Dental infections Skin infections Meningitis (swelling of the brain and spinal cord) Strep throat Bladder and kidney infections Bacterial pneumonias Whooping cough Only bacterial infections can be killed with antibiotics. The common cold, flu, most coughs, some bronchitis infections, most sore throats, and the stomach flu are all caused by viruses. Antibiotics won't work to treat them. Your doctor will tell you either to wait these illnesses out or prescribe antiviral drugs to help you get rid of them. It's not always obvious whether an infection is viral or bacterial. Sometimes your doctor will do tests before deciding which treatment you need. Some antibiotics work on many different kinds of bacteria. They're called âbroad-spectrum.â Others target specific bacteria only. They're known as ânarrow-spectrum.â Since your gut is full of bacteria -- both good and bad -- antibiotics often affect your digestive system while they're treating an infection. Common side effects include: Vomiting Nausea Diarrhea Bloating or indigestion Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Occasionally, you may have other symptoms, like: Hives â a raised, itchy skin rash Coughing Wheezing Tight throat or trouble breathing These symptoms can mean you're allergic to your antibiotic, so let your doctor know right away if you have them. If you're taking birth control pills, antibiotics may keep them from working as well as they should, so speak to your doctor about whether alternative birth control methods might be a good idea. Women can also get vaginal yeast infections while taking antibiotics. The swelling from it causes itching, burning, vaginal discharge (looks similar to cottage cheese) and pain during sex. It's treated with an anti-fungal cream. Antibiotics are a powerful germ-fighting tool when used carefully and safely. But up to one-half of all antibiotic use isn't necessary. Overuse has led to antibacterial resistance. Bacteria adapt over time and become âsuper bacteriaâ or âsuperbugs.â They change so that antibiotics no longer work on them. They pose a big threat, because there aren't any medicines to kill them. The best way to help slow the spread of super bacteria is by being smart with antibiotics. Here's how: Trust your doctor if she says you don't need them. Don't take them for a viral infection. Only take the ones your doctor has prescribed for you. Take them as directed. Don't skip doses. Take them for the full number of days your doctor prescribes. Don't save them for later."
16,"As your body experiences light, sound, touch, and other sensations, your brain takes in that information as a series of electrical signals. If you have multiple sclerosis ( MS), the disease causes damage to your nerves that may slow down, garble, or stop this activity entirely. Evoked potential tests can help doctors see if this is happening to you. The tests measure the electrical activity in parts of the brain caused by light, sound, and touch. They can help doctors diagnose someone with MS because they can detect problems along some nerves that are too subtle to find through other exams. There are three main types of evoked potential tests: Visual evoked potentials ( VEP): You sit in front of a screen and watch an alternating checkerboard pattern. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEP): You hear a series of clicks in each ear. Sensory evoked potentials ( SEP): You get short electrical pulses on one of your arms or legs. A fourth type of test, motor evoked potentials, can find damage along nerves in the brain and spinal cord that make your body move. But doctors don't usually use this type to diagnose MS. When you have the tests, you'll have wires placed on your scalp. It's safe and painless. It usually takes about 2 hours to do all three types of evoked potential tests. A doctor with special training in these tests will interpret the results. While evoked potentials can help diagnose MS, they can't let your doctor know for sure whether the condition is causing problems with the signals in your nerves or if they're happening because of another health problem. Your doctor will consider the results of these tests along with those of other lab tests and your symptoms before he makes a diagnosis."
17,"If you have migraines, you know these throbbing, pulsing headaches can put a damper on an otherwise good day. While medications can help you manage them, there can be side effects. That's why some people with migraines like to go âall naturalâ to find relief. The good news is there is some evidence these supplements, which include things like vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes, may help. But the science is limited. Remember, âall naturalâ doesn't necessarily mean safe. Any supplement you take should be discussed with your doctor. It's important to note that the FDA doesn't have the authority to review these kinds of products for safety and effectiveness before they're put on the market. So your best bet may be to look for a â USP Verifiedâ label. That means it's at least been tested by the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention for things like purity and potency. It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly. Researchers have tested magnesium supplements for treating and preventing migraines. So far, the results are mixed. If you want to try it, you should take about 400 milligrams each day. You have to take it for at least 3 months to know whether it works for you. Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics. Better known as vitamin B2, this may make migraines less frequent and less severe for some people. It's found naturally in foods like: Meat Eggs Milk Green veggies Nuts Enriched flour And like many of the other B vitamins, it's also found in daily vitamin pills. Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them. This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation. Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines. But most results have been mixed. None of the studies showed that feverfew caused any serious side effects. If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results. Don't take feverfew if you take an anticoagulant drug. Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective. You may have popped some melatonin to get a good night's rest after a stress-filled week or taken it to adjust your sleep-wake cycle during a bout of jet lag. Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective. Melatonin generally works well with your body, but it can cause daytime sleepiness. In rare cases, it can cause abdominal discomfort and even short bouts of depression. If you take an anticoagulant, an immunosuppressant, diabetes medications, or birth control pills, talk to your doctor since it can interact with these drugs."
18,"You've taken the anti-inflammatory medications. You've done the pain pills. You've even tried the hard-to-pronounce glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, the alternative supplements for osteoarthritis. You've stayed off your knee. Walked with a cane. Done the cortisone injections and given physical therapy your best shot. You've even lost a few pounds to ease the pressure. But your knee still hurts. A lot. You feel it before you get out of bed in the morning. Or maybe it stays swollen and has begun to bow. If any of these symptoms sound familiar, you may need knee replacement surgery. The knee is the most commonly replaced joint in the body. But your orthopedic surgeon won't make the decision to operate lightly. They'll take your complete medical history, everything from your overall health to specifics about your knee pain and how it affects your life. You'll also have a physical exam so your surgeon can check out how your leg lines up and how much motion, strength, and stability you have in your knee. X-rays are a key tool. They'll give your surgeon a better idea of whether your bone is damaged or deformed. An imaging test called an MRI will give a more detailed look into the bone and soft tissues around your knee. You also may get a blood test to rule out, or point to, other causes for your knee pain. If your doctor decides a total knee replacement is the way to go, you can learn about how much it might help, possible complications, and what to expect after surgery. If you are obese, most surgeons will insist you lose some weight. Your surgeon may decide that a total knee replacement isn't right for you. They may talk about other treatment options like arthroscopic surgery, joint preservation procedures, or a partial knee replacement."
19,"Cervical spondylosis is also called cervical osteoarthritis. It is a condition involving changes to the bones, discs, and joints of the neck. These changes are caused by the normal wear-and-tear of aging. With age, the discs of the cervical spine gradually break down, lose fluid, and become stiffer. Cervical spondylosis usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly people. As a result of the degeneration of discs and other cartilage, spurs or abnormal growths called osteophytes may form on the bones in the neck. These abnormal growths can cause narrowing of the interior of the spinal column or in the openings where spinal nerves exit, a related condition called cervical spinal stenosis. Cervical spondylosis most often causes neck pain and stiffness. Although cervical spondylosis is rarely progressive, corrective surgery can be helpful in severe cases. Aging is the major factor for developing cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis). In most people older than age 50, the discs between the vertebrae become less spongy and provide less of a cushion. Bones and ligaments get thicker, encroaching on the space of the spinal canal. Another factor might be a previous injury to the neck. People in certain occupations or who perform specific activities -- such as gymnasts or other athletes -- may put more stress on their necks. Poor posture might also play a role in the development of spinal changes that result in cervical spondylosis. The symptoms of cervical spondylosis include: Neck stiffness and pain Headache that may originate in the neck Pain in the shoulder or arms Inability to fully turn the head or bend the neck, sometimes interfering with driving Grinding noise or sensation when the neck is turned Symptoms of cervical spondylosis tend to improve with rest. Symptoms are most severe in the morning and again at the end of the day. If cervical spondylosis results in pressure on the spinal cord (cervical stenosis), it can put pressure on the spinal cord, a condition called cervical myelopathy. Symptoms of cervical spondylosis with myelopathy include: Tingling, numbness, and/or weakness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet Lack of coordination and difficulty walking Abnormal reflexes Muscle spasms Loss of control over bladder and bowel (incontinence) Another possible complication of cervical spondylosis is cervical radiculopathy, when bone spurs press on nerves as they exit the bones of the spinal column. Pain shooting down into one or both arms is the most common symptom. The doctor will generally begin by asking you about symptoms and taking a medical history. This will be followed by a physical exam of the body, with a focus on the neck, back, and shoulders. The doctor is also likely to test reflexes and the strength of hands and arms, check for loss of sensation, and watch you walk. Other tests that might be done include imaging exams such as X-rays, computed tomography ( CT), and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). MRI scans use large magnets, radio waves, and a computer to produce the best images of the body. You might also be referred to a neurologist. In most cases, cervical spondylosis treatments are conservative. They include: Rest Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) or other non-narcotic products to relieve pain from inflammation Chiropractic manipulation that can help to control episodes of more severe pain Wearing a cervical collar to limit movement and provide support Other forms of physical therapy, including the application of heat and cold therapy, traction, or exercise Injecting drugs (corticosteroids and a local anesthetic) into the joints of the spine or the area surrounding the spine, known as epidural steroid injection or cervical facet joint injection Cervical spondylosis tends to be a chronic (long-term) condition. But in most cases, it is not progressive. Surgery is required only in rare cases. The goal of surgery is to remove the source of pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. The surgery may also include adding stabilization in the form of implants or through fusion of the vertebrae. But surgery is considered only when there is a severe loss of function. For instance, it might be considered if you had a progressive loss of feeling and function in your arms, legs, feet, or fingers. Any type of spinal cord compression could result in permanent functional disability. The surgeon can approach the cervical spine from the front (anterior) or the back (posterior). Approaching from the front might be used to remove the discs and spurs that are causing pressure. The disc may be replaced with an implant. A more extensive surgery calls for the removal of both discs and parts of the vertebra. These parts are replaced with a bone graft or implant. Approaching from the back would be used to perform either a laminectomy or a laminoplasty. In a laminectomy, the rear parts of the vertebrae in the neck -- the lamina and spinous processes -- are removed. In a laminoplasty, the vertebra is left in place, but is cut free along one side. Both procedures relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. As with any surgery, there is risk of infection or complications with anesthesia. Surgery is usually followed by a rehabilitation program."
20,"Stimulant medications are usually a doctor's first choice for treating ADHD, but they're not for everyone. They can cause bad side effects for some people. For others, they just don't work very well. If you're looking for other medications that work for the disorder, you've got several choices. Sometimes your doctor will add one of these medicines to the stimulant you take, or he might have you take one of the following by itself. There are three main groups of nonstimulant medications for the condition: ADHD-specific nonstimulants. These were specifically created to treat the disorder and are FDA-approved for that. Blood pressure medications. They can also help some people control ADHD. Some of these have the same active ingredient as ADHD-specific nonstimulants. Antidepressants . These can help against the disorder by working on chemicals in the brain. They're also helpful for people who have ADHD and depression, anxiety, or another mood disorder. Atomoxetine ( Strattera) is OK for children, teens, and adults. It seems to boost the amount of an important brain chemical called norepinephrine. This appears to increase a person's attention span and lessen their impulsive behavior and hyperactivity. Clonidine ER ( Kapvay) and Guanfacine ER ( Intuniv) are approved for children ages 6 to 17. Doctors also prescribe them to adults. These two drugs have an effect on certain areas in the brain. Studies show they lower distractibility and improve attention, working memory, and impulse control. Nonstimulants don't tend to cause agitation, sleeplessness, or lack of appetite. They also don't pose the same risk of abuse or addiction. Plus, they have a longer-lasting and smoother effect than many stimulants, which can take effect and wear off abruptly. Atomoxetine might cause: Upset stomach Less appetite, which may cause weight loss Nausea Dizziness Fatigue Mood swings Other less-common risks include: Jaundice and liver problems. Call your doctor right away if you get yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. Suicidal thinking. There's a possibility that atomoxetine, like many antidepressant drugs, may slightly raise the risk of these thoughts in kids, teenagers, and young adults. Erections that last more than 4 hours. Serious allergic reactions. Some people get rashes, hives, or swelling, although this is rare. Clonidine ( Kapvay) and Guanfacine ( Intuniv) side effects include: Sleepiness, fatigue, sedation Headache Dizziness Since it can cause drowsiness, make sure you know how it affects you before you drive or use heavy machinery. Rarer and more serious side effects include: Low blood pressure Heart rhythm changes Talk to your doctor about your medical history and go over all the risks. You should probably not take atomoxetine ( Strattera) if you: Have been diagnosed with narrow angle glaucoma (a condition that causes pressure in the eyes and can lead to blindness) Use a depression drug called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI), like phenelzine ( Nardil) or tranylcypromine ( Parnate) Have an allergy to any of the ingredients in atomoxetine ( Strattera) Have jaundice or liver problems Don't take clonidine ( Kapvay) if you're allergic to it. You should probably not take guanfacine ( Intuniv) if you: Have an allergy to any of the ingredients in it Take other products containing guanfacine, like the blood pressure medicine guanfacine hcl ( Tenex) Before you take this type of medicine, be sure to tell your doctor if you: Are nursing, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant Take any prescription medications for other conditions, like blood pressure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives, or antipsychotics Take any dietary supplements, herbal medicines, or over-the-counter medications Have any medical problems, including high or low blood pressure, seizures, heart disease, glaucoma, mental health issues, liver disease or jaundice, or kidney problems Have had an allergic reaction to any medications Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependency Become agitated or irritable, or have suicidal thoughts If you and your doctor decide nonstimulants are right for you, take your medicine exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may order some lab tests once in a while to make sure the drug is working well and not causing you any problems. Some drugs normally taken for high blood pressure, like clonidine ( Kavpay) and guanfacine hcl ( Tenex), may help control symptoms of the disorder. They also can help lower some of the side effects of stimulant meds, especially sleeplessness and aggressive behavior. They can be used alone or along with stimulants. Experts aren't sure, but it's clear that they have a calming effect on certain areas of the brain. Combining stimulants with one of these drugs is controversial, though. Some children taking both stimulants and clonidine hcl have died. It's unclear whether their deaths were due to the combination of drugs. If you take them together, your doctor should watch you closely to help lower your risk of problems. They can screen you for heart rhythm irregularities, check your blood pressure often, and do electrocardiograms or a pre-existing heart conditions. If your doctor thinks that taking these two medications has more possible benefits than risks, it may be a good option for you. They might not be a good fit if you have a history of low blood pressure or if you or a family member has had a heart problem. The most common ones include: Drowsiness Lowered blood pressure Headache Dizziness Rarely, the drugs can cause irregular heartbeats. When taking one of these meds for your ADHD, be sure to tell your doctor if you: Are nursing, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant Are taking or plan to take any dietary supplements, herbal medicines, or nonprescription medications Have any medical problems now or in the past, including low blood pressure, seizures, heart rhythm disturbances, and urinary problems Start having irregular heartbeats (heart palpitations) or fainting spells Also, keep these guidelines in mind: Always take or give the medication exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor about any problems or questions. It's best not to miss doses or patches, since this may cause the blood pressure to rise quickly, which may cause headaches and other symptoms. Your doctor will probably want to start the medication at a low dose and increase it gradually until your symptoms are under control. For very young children, clonidine tablets can be changed into a liquid by a compounding pharmacy. This will make it easier for them to take. Tablets can be crushed and mixed with food if you have to. Do not stop taking clonidine or guanfacine suddenly. This can cause an increase in blood pressure. These medications must be tapered off gradually. Several types of these can treat the disorder, too. They're sometimes the treatment of choice for children or adults who have ADHD and depression. Antidepressants seem to improve attention span, impulse control, hyperactivity, and aggressiveness. Children and teens who take them are often more willing to take direction and are less disruptive. But these drugs generally don't work as well as stimulants or nonstimulants to improve attention span and concentration. Antidepressants have the advantage of a low potential for abuse, and there is no evidence that they suppress growth or contribute to significant weight loss. Most of them work by boosting the levels of brain messenger-chemicals (neurotransmitters), such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. How high blood pressure drugs work in treating ADHD is not yet known, but it is clear that they have a calming effect on certain areas of the brain. Clonidine and guanfacine can help reduce some of the side effects of stimulant therapy, especially sleeplessness and aggressive behavior. However, combining stimulants with one of these drugs is controversial, because there have been some deaths in children taking both stimulants and Catapres (a patch form of clonidine). It is not known whether these deaths were due to the combination of drugs, but caution should be exercised whenever such combinations are used. Careful screening for heart rhythm irregularities and regular monitoring of blood pressure and electrocardiograms help reduce these risks. If your doctor thinks that combining these two treatments offers more benefits than risks, it may be a good option. The main kinds of these drugs used to treat ADHD are: Tricyclic antidepressants. They've been shown to be helpful and are relatively inexpensive. But they can cause some unpleasant side effects, like dry mouth, constipation, or urinary problems. Options include: Desipramine ( Norpramin, Pertofrane) Imipramine ( Tofranil) Nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor) Bupropion ( Wellbutrin) is a different type of antidepressant that is very effective in treating ADHD in adults and children. It's generally well-tolerated, but it also has some side effects that may be a problem for some people who have anxiety or seizures. Monoamine oxidase ( MAO) inhibitors are a group of antidepressants that can treat ADHD with some benefit. But they're rarely used because they sometimes have dangerous side effects and can cause serious problems when you take them with foods and other medications. They may help people if no other medications have worked. Examples include phenelzine ( Nardil) or tranylcypromine ( Parnate). Venlafaxine ( Effexor and Effexor XR) is a newer antidepressant that boosts the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. It helps improve mood and concentration. It's not often used to treat ADHD, though. In October 2004, the FDA determined that antidepressant medications raise the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children and teens with depression and other psychiatric disorders. Discuss any questions or concerns with your doctor. Don't take them if you: Have a history or a tendency toward manic behavior or manic depression (bipolar disorder). Have taken a MAO inhibitor antidepressant, such as phenelzine ( Nardil) or tranylcypromine ( Parnate), within the last 14 days. Bupropion ( Wellbutrin) can't be taken if you have any history of seizures or epilepsy. Talk about the pros and cons of antidepressants with your doctor to figure out if they might be right for you. The most common side effects of tricyclics include: Stomach upset Constipation Dry mouth Blurred vision Drowsiness Low blood pressure Weight gain Tremors Sweating Trouble peeing An overdose can be deadly. Tricyclics have the potential to cause certain heart defects, too. You may need ECG tests at a doctor's office to look for these problems. Bupropion ( Wellbutrin) sometimes causes stomach upset, anxiety, headaches, and rashes. Venlafaxine ( Effexor) can cause nausea, anxiety, sleep problems, tremor, dry mouth, and sexual problems in adults. MAO inhibitors can cause a wide variety of side effects, including dangerously increased blood pressure when combined with certain foods or medications. When taking one of these meds, be sure to tell your doctor if you: Are nursing, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant Take or plan to take any dietary supplements, herbal medicines, or nonprescription medications Have any medical problems now or have had any in the past including high blood pressure, seizures, heart disease and urinary problems Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependency, or if you have had mental health problems, including depression, manic depression, or psychosis Get any depressive symptoms or feelings that you might harm yourself Start to have irregular heartbeats (heart palpitations) or fainting spells Keep these tips in mind if you take antidepressants or give them to your child: Always give the medication exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor with any problems or questions. Antidepressants usually take at least 2 to 4 weeks before you start to notice if they're working. Be patient, and don't give up before giving them a chance to work. Your doctor will probably want to start your medication at a low dose and raise it slowly over time until your symptoms are under control. It's best not to miss doses. You take most once or twice a day. If you miss a day or two of venlafaxine ( Effexor), it can cause an unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Tell your doctor if you notice any new or unusual side effects."
21,"Urinary incontinence -- when you accidentally leak urine -- is a problem that affects millions of Americans, most of them women. There are several different types, causes, and treatments. With this type, urine leaks due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and tissues. It can happen when pressure on your bladder increases -- such as when you exercise, laugh, sneeze, or cough. Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken a woman's pelvic floor muscles. Other things that can lead to stress incontinence are being overweight or obese, taking certain medications or, in men, having prostate surgery. This is also called overactive bladder ( OAB). With this type, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time. Causes of overactive bladder include: Damage to the bladder's nerves Damage to other parts of the nervous system Damage to muscles Aging Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and stroke can affect nerves, leading to urge incontinence. Bladder problems, such as infections and bladder stones, and certain medications can also cause it. If you can't empty your bladder, you may have overflow incontinence. This means you may dribble urine. Causes include: Weak bladder muscles Nerve damage Conditions that block the flow of urine, such as tumors or an enlarged prostate Constipation Certain medications You need to get the condition treated. If your bladder can't empty, that can lead to infections and other problems. Mental or physical problems such as dementia or arthritis prevent you from getting to the bathroom in time. This means you have any two types of the condition. Many women have both stress and urge incontinence. Lifestyle changes and treatments can help with symptoms. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan that's right for you. For stress incontinence, treatments include: Pads and Vaginal Inserts. Pelvic floor exercises. If you've had a baby, chances are you've been told to do Kegel exercises. These help to strengthen the pelvic floor after childbirth. They also help prevent stress incontinence. Best of all, you can do Kegels anytime, anywhere. Here's how: Squeeze the muscles that you use stop the flow of urine. Hold the squeeze for 10 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Do 3 or 4 sets daily. Note: You can learn how to do Kegels by stopping your urine, but don't do this routinely. Stopping the flow of urine can lead to an infection. Biofeedback . A probe is inserted to monitor when your bladder muscles squeeze. When you're able to recognize it as it's happening, you can start to gain control of it. It's often used in combination with Kegel exercises. Pessary. For women, doctors may prescribe a device called a pessary that is inserted into the vagina. It repositions the urethra to help reduce leakage. Injections and surgery. Shots to bulk up your urethral area may help. In more extreme cases, you may need surgery. One procedure pulls the bladder (urethra) back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage. Another surgery involves securing the bladder (urethra) with a ""sling,"" a piece of material that holds up the bladder to prevent leakage. For urge incontinence, treatment options include: Timed voiding and bladder training. First, you complete a chart of the times you pee and the times you leak. You observe patterns and then plan to empty your bladder before an accident would happen. You can also ""retrain"" your bladder, gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. Kegel exercises are also helpful. Medications, electrical stimulation, or surgery. Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines (or inject Botox in the bladder) that block the contractions of an overactive bladder. Electrical stimulation of the bladder nerves helps in some cases. Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery. Meds called alpha-blockers often can help if the problem is caused by an enlarged prostate. If there's a blockage, you may need surgery. Catheter. Some people use a catheter to make sure their bladder is emptied. It's a thin plastic tube that you insert in your urethra. A doctor or nurse can teach you how to insert it for yourself. It's important to identify any underlying disease or blockage causing overflow incontinence and treat that. You might feel embarrassed to talk about your urinary incontinence, but it's worth it. Your doctor can help you figure out what's causing your problem. That's the first step to getting help. Be straightforward. Just tell your doctor you're having problems. Keep it simple: "" I'm having bladder problems."" Your doctor should ask questions, like how long the leakage has been happening, how bad it is, and how much it upsets your life. She may suggest tests or refer you to an expert in this kind of problem."
22,"Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) mainly affects the joints. But it, and many of the medications that treat it, can also affect the skin. Do you recognize any of these problems? About 1 in 5 of people with rheumatoid arthritis get rheumatoid nodules. These hard lumps of tissue range in size from about the size of a pea to as large as a ping pong ball. They may develop under the skin over bony areas such as the elbow, ankle, or finger. They can also form on organs such as the lungs. For some people, treatment with â DMARDsâ (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) or steroid shots may shrink nodules. You may need surgery to remove them if they get infected or become painful. It's rare, but in some people, nodules are a sign that they have rheumatoid vasculitis, which is inflammation of the small and medium-sized blood vessels. Only about 1 in 100 people with rheumatoid arthritis get vasculitis. The most commonly affected blood vessels are arteries that carry blood to the skin, nerves, and internal organs. When the small vessels of the fingertips and around the nails are affected, the result can be small pits on the fingertips or small sores or redness around the nail. If it happens in larger blood vessels, it can cause a painful rash, often on the legs. In serious cases, ulcers can form and there's a chance they could become infected. The skin problems people with RA have are often related to the medications they take to ease symptoms or control their disease. Drug-related skin problems include: Skin rashes . This can happen if you take drugs such as: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac ( Voltaren) Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) Ibuprofen Leflunomide ( Arava) Methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall) Minocycline ( Minocin) Naproxen Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Tolmetin ( Tolectin) A skin rash can be a sign of an allergic reaction to a drug. So you should let your doctor know if your skin breaks out or starts itching. Depending on the type of rash you have and how severe it is, your doctor may lower the dose or stop your medication altogether. In some cases, you may need another drug, such as a corticosteroid or antihistamine, to stop the reaction. Easy bruising. Certain arthritis medications make you more likely to bruise because they thin the skin or interfere with blood clotting. These include aspirin and steroids such as prednisone. Sun sensitivity. Drugs that can make your skin more sensitive to sun include: Cyclosporine ( Sandimmune, Neoral) Diclofenac ( Voltaren) Diflunisal ( Dolobid) Ketoprofen Methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall) Naproxen ( Naprosyn) Piroxicam ( Feldene) If you take medicines that do this, avoid direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Don't use tanning beds. When outdoors, wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more that protects against UVA and UVB rays."
23,"Stress and pain often go hand in hand. Hypnosis, meditation, and relaxation may help break the cycle. If you're thinking about trying these ways to work on your pain, you'll want to know what to expect and how well they work. If you're picturing a stage act led by a man with a swinging watch who gets volunteers to walk like a chicken or bark like a dog, forget that. Clinical hypnosis is a real therapy in which you learn how to use the power of your mind to help make positive changes. And you're in control. During hypnosis, you'll focus on relaxation and letting go of distracting thoughts. You may become more open to specific suggestions and goals, such as lowering pain. After your session, your therapist will go over the things that you can do to help you reach those goals. Research shows that medical hypnosis can help with both sudden (acute) and long-term (chronic) pain from cancer, burns, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also ease the anxiety some people feel before surgery. When researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York analyzed 18 studies, they found moderate to large pain-relieving effects from hypnosis, supporting its use for pain management. To find a licensed hypnotherapist, speak to your doctor or contact the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. Meditation is like brain training. Anyone can do it -- anytime, anywhere. Studies suggest that making meditation a habit may help people manage their pain and self-esteem and lower their anxiety, depression, and stress. The details vary, depending on what type of meditation you choose to do, but it comes down to spending a few minutes (or longer) focusing your attention on one thing -- such as your breathing or a word or phrase that inspires or comforts you. As you meditate, other thoughts are bound to come up. That's OK. Just direct your attention back to the thing you chose to focus on. Meditation is safe to try in addition to (not instead of) treatments that your doctor recommends. These include techniques that aim to ease stress. In addition to meditation, the major types include: Progressive muscle relaxation . You slowly tense each muscle group, hold the tension briefly, and then let it go. You'll do this in a systematic way -- for instance, starting with the muscles in your toes and working your way up your body. It helps you become aware of -- and release -- areas where you're tense. If you have cardiovascular (heart) disease that's not under good control, you should skip progressive muscle relaxation. Tensing your abdominal muscles can build up pressure in the chest cavity, slow your pulse, and hamper the flow of blood returning to the heart. Autogenic training . This technique uses visual imagery and body awareness to help you relax. The person imagines being in a peaceful place and then focuses on different physical sensations, such as heaviness of the limbs or a calm heartbeat. People may practice on their own, creating their own images, or be guided by a therapist. Breathing. It's something you do every second of every day -- but often, we forget that it's happening at all. You can practice tuning into your breathing as a form of meditation: in and out, in and out. You can also learn to do breathing exercises. For instance, you can breathe in slowly while you count to 4, hold your breath for 7 more counts, and then exhale for 8 counts. The best way to learn relaxation techniques is with the help of a trained practitioner. Usually, these techniques are taught in a group class and then practiced regularly at home. If you've had psychosis or epilepsy, you may want to speak with your doctor before trying meditation. There have been reports of some people having further acute episodes after deep and prolonged meditation. Hypnosis or deep relaxation can sometimes worsen psychological problems in people with posttraumatic stress disorder or who are vulnerable to false memories. You should check with your doctor first."
24,"Medicines can ease migraines and other types of headaches, but people often use complementary and alternative treatments to get relief. Stress is known to lead to some of the most common types of headaches, including migraines and tension headaches. So scientists have studied alternative treatments aimed at stress reduction, such as biofeedback and relaxation, and found that they often work well. Some people get relief from nontraditional headache treatments -- including acupuncture, massage, herbs, and diets -- but others don't. Some tried and true methods include: Electromyographic ( EMG) biofeedback Botox Stress management Acupuncture Massage Herbs Aromatherapy Diet changes Biofeedback helps you use information (feedback) about muscle tension, skin temperature, brain waves, and other body signals to ease your stress. A technician places small metal sensors, called electrodes, on your skin to measure those signs. A machine shows that data as numbers, electrical waves, or sounds on a screen. Studies show there are differences in blood flow in the brain during migraine attacks and in the pain-free periods in between. Using biofeedback training, you can change the blood flow to your brain and better manage a headache. Most studies on biofeedback show that it makes headaches shorter and happen less often in children and adults. In general, its effects seem similar to many drugs that treat headaches, and it can be part of early treatment for migraines. You can work with a specialist at the psychology, psychiatry, and integrative medicine departments of many medical centers to learn how to use biofeedback. Though it's best known for the role it plays in smoothing out frown lines, Onabotulinumtoxin A ( Botox) can also help treat chronic migraines. That means you have both: A history of migraine headaches Headaches (including tension-type) on most days (15 or more) of the month, of which 8 are migraines Doctors think Botox works for migraine headaches because it blocks chemicals called neurotransmitters that carry pain signals from your brain. Botox is like a roadblock in that pathway. It stops the chemicals before they get to the nerve endings around your head and neck. Botox won't work for you if you: Get headaches 14 or fewer days each month Have other types of headaches, like cluster ones You'll get the treatment every 3 months for a year or more. It consists of shots in these areas: Bridge of your nose Forehead Temples Back of your head Neck Upper back It may be a couple of weeks after the first shots before results show up. Life events that increase stress, anxiety, and depression have been linked with chronic migraines and other headaches. Studies show that a combination of stress management and some antidepressant drugs ease headaches and the use of pain medications. Along with a regular practice of relaxation, it may also help to get enough sleep and eat a healthy diet. A specialist in psychology, psychiatry, or integrative medicine can teach you how to use relaxation training. In this ancient Chinese technique, practitioners insert fine needles into points on your body. They say it helps ease headaches by correcting energy imbalances and making your body better able to resist or overcome illness. Research shows acupuncture may cause your body to release chemicals that block pain, like endorphins. It also may tell your brain to give off other chemicals and hormones that send signals between different types of cells, including those of the immune system. Acupuncture seems to help with a variety of health problems. The World Health Organization recognizes more than 30 conditions it can improve, from allergies to tennis elbow. Other studies, though, suggest it mainly helps people because they believe it will work. This is what doctors call the placebo effect. What makes acupuncture a unique pain treatment is that its effects may be long-lasting. In one study, it eased chronic pain in the neck and shoulder areas and the headaches it caused, and the effects lasted for months. If you try this approach, be sure to look for an experienced, well-trained acupuncturist who uses sterile needles. Many states require a license, certification, or registration to practice it, so check the laws in your area. Clinical trials haven't shown convincing evidence that massage treats headaches. But it's a great way to reduce stress and relieve tension. It especially helps with tightness of tender muscles, such as those in the back of the head, neck, and shoulders, and it boosts blood flow in those areas. For some people, massage may relieve headaches caused by muscle tension. People use a variety of herbs for migraine and headache treatment and prevention. Most of the studies on effectiveness and safety have looked at two: Feverfew is the most popular herbal way to prevent migraines, and studies have shown that it may be helpful, with only mild side effects. But there are no convincing data that it is more effective than a placebo (a fake pill). Scientists need to do more research on these treatments. Butterbur got the nod for making migraines less frequent. Only use products that have been processed to remove plant chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids ( PAs). They can cause liver damage and serious illness. Keep in mind that there isn't much information about the long-term effects of butterbur. Before you try any herbs or supplements, talk to your doctor to be sure they're safe for you and they won't interfere with other medicines you're taking. In this type of treatment, you breathe in essential oils or rub them on your skin to help you relax and change how you perceive pain. Many people say that lavender, ginger, or peppermint oils may help relieve tension headaches. Scientists need more research to know how well this therapy works. Also, be careful when you put oils on your skin. Some can irritate it. Certain foods, such as chocolate, aged cheese, citrus fruits, and red wine, may trigger headaches for some people. If this is true for you, try to identify and avoid food-related headache triggers. ( The same goes for other things that bring on headaches, including stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue.) You can start by keeping a careful diary of your headache symptoms and eating habits. Researchers have done only a few studies to test if diet changes can ease headache pain. Some found that people who ate less fat had fewer migraines. Others suggest adding omega-3 fatty acids to your diet. Supplements that might help include magnesium, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, and melatonin. Again, more research is needed on to know if they're safe and effective. Your best bet is to eat a well-balanced diet. Don't skip meals or fast. Each can trigger a migraine. Talk to your doctor before you start a new diet or take any new medications, including vitamins, herbs, and supplements."
25," Are you worried about your mental sharpness? Or maybe that of a loved one's? Mild forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging. If you have trouble remembering someone's name but it comes to you later, that's not a serious memory problem. But if memory problems are seriously affecting your daily life, they could be early signs of Alzheimer's disease. While the number of symptoms you have and how strong they are vary, it's important to identify the early signs. You need to ask yourself some tough questions. 1. Memory loss This is the most common symptom. Do you easily forget information you just learned? Do you lose track of important dates, names, and events? Do you forget big things even happened? Do you ask for the same information over and over? Do you rely heavily on memory aids like Post-it notes or reminders on your smartphone? 2. Trouble planning and problem solving Do you have trouble making plans and sticking to them? Is it tricky to follow a recipe, even one you've used many times? Is it hard to concentrate on detailed tasks, especially if they involve numbers? For example, can you keep track of your bills and balance your checkbook? 3. Daily tasks are a challenge Even familiar things can become hard. Do you have trouble driving to a location you go to often? Can you complete an ordinary task at work? Do you forget the rules of your favorite game? 4. Times and places are confusing Can you fully grasp something that's not happening right now? Are you disoriented? Do you get lost easily? Do you forget where you are? Do you remember how you got there? 5. Changes in vision Is it harder to read the words on the page? Do you have trouble judging distance? Can you tell colors apart? This is important because it can affect your driving. 6. Words and conversations are frustrating Vocabulary becomes hard. Can you find the right word you're looking for? Or do you call things by the wrong name? Conversations can be a struggle. Do you avoid joining in? Are you able to follow along? Do you suddenly stop in the middle of a discussion because you don't know what to say? Do you keep repeating yourself? 7. You lose things Everyone misplaces things from time to time, but can you retrace your steps to find them again? Do you put things in unusual places, like your watch in the refrigerator? Do you accuse people of taking things? 8. Lapse in judgment Have you made poor decisions lately? Do you make mistakes with money, like giving it away when you normally wouldn't? Are you showering as often? Do you take less care of yourself? Do you dress for the wrong weather? 9. Social withdrawal Are you scaling back on projects at work? Are you less involved with your favorite hobbies? Do you lack motivation? Do you find yourself watching television or sleeping more than usual? 10. Mood changes Do you get upset more easily? Do you feel depressed, scared, or anxious? Are you suspicious of people? If you notice these signs, talk with your doctor. She will evaluate your physical and mental health. She will look over your medical history and do a mental status test, which looks at your memory, ability to solve simple problems, and thinking skills. She may also do blood or brain imaging tests. She may then refer you to someone who specializes in Alzheimer's, like a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in treating the brain and nervous system), psychiatrist, psychologist, or geriatrician (a doctor who specializes in treating older people). You can also find a specialist through your local Alzheimer's Association or Alzheimer's Disease Centers. The sooner you know, the better. Starting treatment may help relieve symptoms and keep you independent longer. It also helps you plan better. You can work out living arrangements, make financial and legal decisions, and build up your support network."
26," Peripheral artery disease, sometimes called peripheral arterial disease, is a condition in which your arteries are narrowed and can't carry as much blood to the outer parts of your body, like your arms and legs. It's a form of peripheral vascular disease. If you don't get treatment, you could be more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. It can also lead to you needing to have a limb removed (amputation). You may have muscle pain or cramping because there's less blood flow to your legs. This type of pain is called claudication. You usually feel it when you walk or climb stairs, but it stops when you rest. It can affect different muscle groups, including: Buttock and hip Calf (most common) Foot (less common) Thigh Some people have a sense of burning or numbness. If you have an advanced form of peripheral artery disease, your toes or feet might hurt even while you're resting. Other signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease include: Changes in the color of your legs Erectile dysfunction Leg weakness Legs that are cooler than your arms Loss of hair on your legs Fainter pulse in your feet Shiny skin on your legs Slow toenail growth Wounds or sores on your toes or feet that don't heal well You can also have severe blockages with no pain at all. This usually is because your body grows blood vessels around the blockages. Things in your bloodstream like fat and cholesterol form plaques that build up in your arteries. That makes those arteries harder and narrower. This condition, called atherosclerosis, is the most common cause of peripheral artery disease. Things that raise your risk of having peripheral artery disease include: Age (over 50) Diabetes High cholesterol High blood pressure Obesity Not being active Smoking Your doctor will start with a physical exam to look for signs of peripheral artery disease. They might check blood flow in your legs and feet and listen for a whooshing sound in your leg arteries. You might get other tests, including: Angiogram, in which your doctor uses a needle to put dye into your bloodstream before taking an X-ray to find blocked arteries Ankle-brachial index, which compares blood pressure in your lower leg and your upper arm Blood tests to check for risk factors like diabetes or high cholesterol Ultrasound to check blood flow and find blocked arteries Some simple things you can do to manage your symptoms and keep peripheral artery disease from getting worse include: Control your cholesterol and blood pressure Eat a healthy diet Exercise Don't smoke You also might need medical treatments including: Angioplasty. This procedure uses a catheter, a thin tube, to put a tiny balloon into your artery. When it's inflated, the balloon pushes plaque out to widen the artery and restore blood flow. Your doctor might also put a mesh tube called a stent into your artery to keep it open. Medications. The drug cilostazol eases symptoms in many people. Pentoxifylline is another medication that can help with poor circulation. Doctors may also prescribe aspirin or other anti-clotting drugs. You also might take medicines to lower your cholesterol, blood pressure, or blood sugar. Surgery. If needed, your doctor can route your blood flow around a blocked artery with a procedure called a bypass graft."
27,"Rheumatoid arthritis treatment includes medications that slow the progression of joint damage from rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs are called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs), and they are an important part of an overall treatment plan. What are these drugs, and how do they work? Disease-modifying drugs act on the immune system to slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. This is why they are called ""disease-modifying."" Many different drugs can be used as DMARDs in the treatment of RA, but some are used more often than others. Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) are used for mild rheumatoid arthritis. They are not as powerful as other DMARDs, but they usually cause fewer side effects. In rare cases, Plaquenil can adversely affect the eyes, and patients taking this medicine should be seen by an ophthalmologist at least once a year. Leflunomide ( Arava) works about as well as methotrexate and can work even better in combination with it. The side effects are similar to methotrexate. Sometimes, Arava causes diarrhea and can't be used. Since Arava is known to cause harm to a fetus, women must take special precautions to prevent pregnancy. Methotrexate is the most commonly used DMARD. This is because it has been shown to work as well or better than any other single medicine. It is also relatively inexpensive and generally safe. Like other DMARDs, methotrexate has side effects; it can cause rash and stomach upset, can be toxic to the liver or bone marrow, and can cause birth defects. In rare cases, it can also cause shortness of breath. Regular blood work is necessary when taking methotrexate. Taking folic acid helps reduce some of the side effects. Methotrexate's biggest advantage could be that it has been shown to be safe to take for long periods of time and can even be used in children. Minocycline ( Minocin) is an antibiotic that is not often prescribed. But it may help RA by stopping inflammation. It can take several months to start working and up to a year before the full effects are known. When taken for long periods, minocycline can cause discoloration of the skin. Biologic drugs: abatacept ( Orencia), adalimumab ( Humira), anakinra ( Kineret), certolizumab ( Cimzia), etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria), and infliximab ( Remicade). These are the newest drugs for RA and are either injected under the skin or given directly into a vein. They work by neutralizing one of the immune system's signals ( TNF) that lead to inflammation and joint damage. Rituximab ( Rituxan) and tocilizumab ( Actemra) are biologics, but do not block TNF. Rituxan target B cells and actemra affects IL-6. When used with methotrexate, these medicines help most people with rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs are thought to have fewer side effects than other DMARDs. One side effect is the risk for potentially severe infections. These medicines can also, although rarely, adversely affect your liver or blood counts. Other potential long-term effects won't be known until the drugs have been used by patients for many years. Azathioprine ( Imuran) is used for many different inflammatory conditions, including RA. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, sometimes with stomach pain and diarrhea. Long-term use of azathioprine is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Cyclosporine ( Neoral ) is a powerful drug that often works well in slowing down joint damage. But because it can hurt the kidneys and has other potential side effects, it is usually used for severe RA after other drugs fail and is not in widespread use at this time. Baricitinib ( Olumiant), tofacitinib ( Xeljanz) iand upadacitinab ( Rinvoq) are drugs classified as JAK inhibitor. They are often used in people who no longer respond to methotrexate. Tofacitinib comes as a pill taken twice a day, while baricitinib or upadacitinib are taken once a day with or without food. Because they inhibit immune responses, they addsto a person's risk of serious infections, cancers, and lymphoma. The drugs will carry a ""black box"" warning about these risks. DMARDs slow down rheumatoid arthritis and improve quality of life for most people. Some will even achieve a remission while taking them. More commonly, the disease activity continues, but at a slower, less intense pace. While taking one or more DMARDs, you may have longer symptom-free periods, or flare ups that are less painful or stressful. Your joints may take less time to loosen up in the morning. At a check-up, your rheumatologist may end up telling you that your most recent X-rays are free of any new damage. Taking a DMARD regularly makes you less likely to have long-term damage to your joints, too. The FDA has approved all DMARDs. Many people take them without ever having problems. But because they work throughout the body to fight RA, their powerful action typically does cause some side effects, commonly: Stomach upset. DMARDs sometimes cause nausea, sometimes with vomiting, or diarrhea. Other medicines can help treat these symptoms, or they often improve as you get used to the drug. If the symptoms are too uncomfortable to tolerate, your rheumatologist will try a different medication. Liver problems. These are less common than stomach upset. Your doctor will check blood tests on a regular basis to make sure your liver is not being harmed. Blood problems. DMARDs can affect the immune system and raise the risk of infection. Infection-fighting white blood cells may also be decreased. Low red blood cells (anemia) can make you tired more easily. A simple blood test by your doctor every so often will make sure your blood counts are high enough. You should learn about possible side effects of any medicine you are taking and discuss them with your doctor until you feel comfortable. To minimize side effects, DMARDs are sometimes started one at a time and increased gradually. The goal is to minimize both rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and medication side effects. It often takes more than one DMARD to get control of active rheumatoid arthritis. How do you know you're on the ""right"" regimen? There's no easy way. Rheumatologists use all their training and experience to determine what's right for you. Though DMARDs can have side effects, there is a good reason to take them -- they're proven to work against rheumatoid arthritis. Even if you are in remission, many rheumatologists believe you should keep taking a DMARD, just to keep your RA at bay. There is also a likelihood of recurring disease when stopped altogether."
28,"A tremor is when a body part moves or shakes and you can't control it. Many people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) have some form of tremor they can't control, in different parts of their bodies, like their head, arms, or legs. Intention tremor. There's no shaking when you're at rest. It starts when you try to reach or grasp something or move your hand or foot to a precise spot. This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Postural tremors. You shake when you sit or stand, but not when you lie down. Resting tremor. You move more when you're sitting still and less when you move. This is more common with Parkinson's disease than MS. Nystagmus. This type causes jumpy eye movements. This disease damages the protective sheath (myelin) that covers the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. Tremors result from damage to a part of your brain called the cerebellum. It controls your balance and coordination and smooths out the actions that you make when you move your limbs and eyes or speak. These problems are one of the hardest MS symptoms to treat. There aren't any drugs made just to treat MS tremors. Your doctors will probably prescribe drugs for another condition, like: Acetazolamide ( Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Buspirone ( Buspar) and clonazepam ( Klonopin), which are anti-anxiety drugs Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril), an antihistamine Isoniazid ( INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone ( Mysoline), a seizure medicine Propranolol ( Inderal), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement. A brace on your ankle or foot can make it easier to walk. They can help control your arm, hand, or neck, too. Deep brain stimulation: This experimental approach is mostly used for people who have tremors from Parkinson's disease. A doctor implants electrodes into your brain. Wires connect them to a gadget in your chest. You use it to send your brain signals that stop the tremors. Medical cannabis: There's little evidence that cannabis can help with tremors, but study results are mixed and usually only include small numbers of people. Physical therapy: It can show you exercises that increase your range of motion, improve your posture and balance, and make your body more stable Speech therapy: If you have tremors in your lips, tongue, or jaw, a health professional can work with you to slow your speech, make it clearer, and control the volume. Occupational therapist: This person will set you up with special tools called adaptive or assistive devices. They can help you grab things from up high or off the floor, pull up a zipper, or hold a fork more easily. Weights: Adding extra weight to a body part can help keep it still. You can also add weights to commonly used items like forks, pencils, pens, eating utensils, canes, and walkers. Tremors can be tough to handle in social situations. You may feel like you want to be alone, but that can make you feel lonely and depressed. A psychologist or counselor can help you find ways to feel more comfortable in public and keep the tremors from changing how you live your life."
29,"LASIK, which stands for laser in-situ keratomileusis, is a popular surgery used to correct vision in people who are nearsighted, farsighted, or have astigmatism. All laser vision correction surgeries work by reshaping the cornea, the clear front part of the eye, so that light traveling through it is properly focused onto the retina located in the back of the eye. LASIK is one of a number of different surgical techniques used to reshape the cornea. LASIK has many benefits, including: It has been around for over 25 years and it works! It corrects vision. Around 96% of patients will have their desired vision after LASIK. An enhancement can further increase this number. LASIK is associated with very little pain due to the numbing drops that are used. Vision is corrected nearly by the day after LASIK. No bandages or stitches are required after LASIK. Adjustments can be made years after LASIK to further correct vision if vision changes while you age. After having LASIK, most patients have a dramatic reduction in eyeglass or contact lens dependence and many patients no longer need them at all. Despite the pluses, there are some disadvantages to LASIK eye surgery: LASIK is technically complex. Rare problems may occur when the doctor creates the flap, which can permanently affect vision. This is one reason to choose a surgeon who is very experienced at performing these surgeries. LASIK can rarely cause a loss of ""best"" vision. Your best vision is the highest degree of vision that you achieved while wearing your contacts or eyeglasses. Some patients experience discomfort in the first 24 to 48 hours after LASIK eye surgery. Other side effects, although rare, may include: Glare Seeing halos around images Difficulty driving at night Fluctuating vision Dry eyes Before LASIK eye surgery, you will meet with a coordinator or eye surgeon who will discuss what to expect during and after the procedure. During this session, your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be fully examined. Likely initial tests include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, corneal mapping, eye pressure, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through the initial evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the procedure. If you wear rigid gas permeable contact lenses, you should not wear them for at least three weeks before your evaluation. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to the evaluation. Be sure to bring your eyeglasses to the surgeon so your prescription can be reviewed. On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye makeup or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you are not feeling well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed. During LASIK eye surgery, an instrument called a microkeratome or femtosecond laser is used to create a thin flap in the cornea. The cornea flap is then painlessly peeled back and the underlying corneal tissue is reshaped using another laser. After the cornea is reshaped so that it can properly focus light onto the retina, the cornea flap is put back in place and the surgery is complete. LASIK is performed while the patient is under local anesthesia in the form of eye drops (no shots, no needles) and usually takes about 10 minutes to complete. Patients may also request mild sedation. Plan to have someone drive you home after surgery. Your eyes will temporarily be dry even though they do not feel that way. Your doctor will give you prescription eye drops to prevent infection and inflammation and eyedrops to keep your eyes moist. These drops may cause a momentary slight burn or blurring of your vision when you use them. Do not use any eye drops not approved by your eye doctor. Healing after LASIK eye surgery usually occurs very rapidly. Vision may be blurry and hazy for the first day, but most patients notice improved vision within a few days of surgery. Specific follow-up after the surgery varies from one surgeon to another. You will revisit the doctor for an evaluation 24 to 48 hours after LASIK eye surgery, as well as at regular intervals within the first six months."
30,"This procedure uses energy to make small scars in your heart tissue. They stop abnormal electrical signals that move through your heart and cause an irregular heartbeat (the doctor might call it arrhythmia). Cardiac ablation can also treat atrial fibrillation ( AFib), also a type of irregular heartbeat. The doctor may try cardiac ablation if medications and resetting your heartbeat -- he'll probably refer to it as cardioversion -- don't work. Catheter ablation, also called radiofrequency or pulmonary vein ablation, isn't surgery, and it's the least invasive option. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel in your leg or neck. Then, it's guided to your heart. When it reaches the area that's causing the arrhythmia, It sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps get your heartbeat regular again. There are two main types: Radiofrequency ablation: The doctor uses catheters to send radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) that creates circular scars around each vein or group of veins. Cryoablation: A single catheter sends a balloon tipped with a substance that freezes the tissues to cause a scar. Surgical ablation involves cutting into your chest. There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement. The surgeon makes small cuts in the upper part of the heart. They're stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Mini maze: Most people with AFib don't need open-heart surgery. That's where this less invasive option comes in. The doctor makes several small cuts between your ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters for either cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. Some hospitals offer robotic-assisted surgery that uses smaller cuts and makes the procedure more precise. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. Convergent procedure: This pairs catheter ablation with a mini maze. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart. You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation. The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay a night or longer in the hospital. Drugs can treat the AFib and keep your heart at a regular rhythm, but they may cause side effects or stop working. Cardiac ablation might be the next option. It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms. And many don't need to take heart rhythm medicine afterward."
31,"Cardiac cachexia is a condition that can happen to people who have heart failure. It means you lose a serious amount of body fat, muscle, and bone. Doctors often call this âbody wasting.â Once it begins, you can't reverse it simply by eating more. It's a complex disorder that has to do with the way your body absorbs and uses the nutrients and calories you eat. The main symptom of cardiac cachexia is weight loss. You may also feel: Very weak and tired Short of breath Unable to exercise or be active Nauseated Not very hungry Constipation Changes in how food tastes Some of these symptoms make you more likely to lose even more weight. The condition also has serious effects on many parts of the body, including the digestive tract, lungs, and heart, and the body's ability to make blood cells. Doctors are not exactly sure what causes cardiac cachexia. It involves many different body systems. Some experts think it may happen when there's an imbalance in the way your body's nervous system tells your digestive tract how to break down food. But scientists know a few things about how the condition affects the body and causes symptoms: Fluid buildup from congestive heart failure can sometimes make it harder to absorb nutrients from food. Malnutrition keeps the liver from making a protein called albumin, which helps the blood carry important chemicals throughout your body. The condition makes your body use more energy to do basic things, like breathing. So you burn more calories, but at the same time, you can't absorb them from food. Your body breaks down muscle proteins. That leads to symptoms like fatigue. The condition causes a problem with some of the hormones your body uses to control blood pressure and blood sugar levels. It also increases inflammation and chemicals in your blood that can cause muscle breakdown. There's no specific test that can diagnose cardiac cachexia. In most cases, doctors will try to rule out other health problems that may be causing your weight loss. If you've lost more than 5% of your body weight in 6 months without trying, your doctor may test your blood to look for substances linked to cardiac cachexia, like the protein albumin. Keep in mind that sometimes it's hard to notice that a person with heart failure has lost weight. A failing heart makes the body to retain water and swell. That can increase your body weight and make you look like you have body fat when you don't. Your doctor can use other tests to figure out if you've lost muscle mass, including measuring how well you do physical activities like walking or how strong your grip is. There are no specific medicines that treat cardiac cachexia. Your doctor will continue to treat your heart failure and try to improve your symptoms. You may get medicines to get rid of the extra fluid that makes you swell. Other treatments may be: Exercise training to build muscle mass or strengthen existing muscles Teaching you how to eat right for your condition Supplements of important nutrients, like vitamins C and D and folate Medicines to make you feel hungrier"
32,"This long-lasting liver infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus. It begins as an acute hepatitis that starts within the first 6 months of exposure to the virus. For most people who get it -- up to 85% -- the illness moves into a long-lasting stage. This is called a chronic hepatitis C infection. Most people catch the hep C virus when blood from someone who has it gets into their body. This can happen if you share needles to use drugs, or get stuck by one because you work in a hospital or doctor's office. People born to a mother have a 6% risk that they will get it, too. You can also get it from having sex with someone who has the virus. Your chances go up if you have a sexually transmitted disease, several partners, or take part in sex that's rough enough to cause bleeding. You can't get hepatitis C by touching, kissing, coughing, sneezing, sharing utensils, or breastfeeding. The CDC recommends you get tested for hepatitis C if: You received blood from a donor who later found out they had hepatitis C You've ever injected drugs You had a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before July 1992 You got a blood product used to treat clotting problems before 1987 You were born between 1945 and 1965 You've had long-term kidney dialysis You have HIV You were born to a mother with hepatitis C Since July 1992, all blood and organ donations in the U. S. are tested for the hepatitis C virus. The CDC says it is now rare that someone getting blood products or an organ would get hepatitis C. You can have the disease and not have symptoms for years. You may not find out you have it until your doctor does a blood test for some other reason and notices a problem with your liver enzymes. If you have chronic hepatitis C, you may notice: Fatigue Upset stomach Drop in appetite Joint and muscle pain You may also have symptoms related to cirrhosis. This condition, which affects people who've had hep C for a long time, causes your liver to scar over: Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) Dark yellow urine Bleeding or bruising easily You can find out if you have a hep C with blood tests. If they're positive, you'll likely have more done to make sure your liver is healthy. You may also need a liver biopsy and imaging tests. Treatment is different for every person. The FDA has approved: Daclatasvir ( Daklinza) Elbasvir-grazoprevir ( Zepatier) Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir ( Harvoni) Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir ( Mavyret) Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, dasabuvir, ritonavir ( Viekira Pak) Ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir ( Technivie) Peginterferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys) Peginterferon alfa-2b ( PEGIntron, Peg Intron RP) Ribavirin ( Copegus, Rebetol, Ribasphere) Sofosbuvir ( Sovaldi) Hepatitis C treatments are changing quickly. Until recently, the most common method was a blend of shots and pills. It most often combined a shot of interferon or peginterferon with the pills ribavirin and one of several other drugs. This caused some unpleasant side effects. Your treatment will depend on many things including what type of hepatitis C virus you have. In the U. S., the most common type is genotype 1, followed by genotypes 2 and 3. Genotypes 4, 5 and 6 are very rare in the U. S. Treatment now centers around direct acting antiviral drugs ( DAAs). These medicines are highly effective for most people with hepatitis C and are interferon-free and often ribavirin-free. This means they typically have fewer side effects. The treatments are often simpler -- consisting of fewer pills for a shorter amount of time. DAAs are available as either single drugs or combined with other medicines in one pill. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir ( Mavyret) offers a shorter treatment cycle of 8 weeks for adult patients with all types of HCV, with or without cirrhosis. They may also be used to treat adult patients with a genotype 1 infection who have been treated with either an HCV NS5 A inhibitor or an NS3/4 A protease inhibitor, but not both. The length of treatment is longer for those who are in a different disease stage. Elbasvir-grazoprevir ( Zepatier), ledipasvir-sofosbuvir ( Harvoni), sofosbuvir-velpatasvir ( Epclusa), and sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir ( Vosevi) are once daily combination pills. Depending on the type of hepatitis C infection, these can often cure the disease in 8 to 12 weeks. Other treatment options include: daclatasvir ( Daklinza); ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir plus dasabuvir ( Viekira Pak); ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir ( Technivie); or some combinations of simeprevir ( Olysio); sofosbuvir ( Sovaldi); peginterferon or ribavirin. Ask your doctor what's best for you, based on your medical needs. All of these drugs are quite expensive, so check with your insurance company or ask your doctor about any drug company assistance programs. The outlook for most people with hepatitis C who are treated is now very good. With new treatments, the viral cure rate is above 90%. The hepatitis virus is considered to be âcuredâ if no virus shows up in a blood test that is done 3 months after your treatment ends. After treatment, make sure you stick with the healthy habits your doctor has instructed and follow up with her regularly. People in whom the virus has not been successfully treated may go on to get cirrhosis and liver disease may need a liver transplant."
33,"The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA) states that all children in the U. S. have a right to a ""free appropriate public education."" For children with autism and children with certain other disabilities, this act mandates the creation of an Individualized Education Program ( IEP). Each IEP is designed for one child. Its purpose is to meet that child's specific special education needs. It sets goals and objectives and describes what services a child will receive as part of his or her special education program. Before an IEP can be created for a child with autism, there is a process to determine whether he or she is eligible for special education. To start the process, your child needs to be evaluated for a disability. That includes autism spectrum disorder or ASD. Either you as a parent or an educational professional in your child's school district needs to request evaluation. If the district makes the request, your consent is needed before the evaluation can be done. Professionals within your child's district are usually the ones who do the evaluation, but it can also be done by a developmental pediatrician or psychologist. The evaluation is what determines that your child is eligible for special education. It also helps identify the special services your child might need. If you think your child's evaluation isn't accurate, you can ask for an independent evaluation. That will be done by a professional from outside the school district. Your child's district may pay for that evaluation. If the evaluation shows your child needs special education or services, creating an Individualized Education Program is the next step. The IEP will be tailored to your child's needs and abilities. The next step after evaluation is the IEP meeting, which is required by law. The Individualized Education Program is supposed to address all aspects of your child's education. So, a number of different people will need to attend the meeting. At the very least, the meeting should include you, your child's teacher, and a special education teacher. Others who are familiar with different aspects of your child's needs and abilities -- social workers, school psychologists, therapists, or doctors -- also should attend. When appropriate, your child may also participate and offer input at the meeting. The people who attend make up a team. That team will discuss how to best meet your child's educational needs. To prepare for the meeting -- and if your child is able to articulate answers -- you may find it helpful to ask your child questions about school such as: "" What is your favorite subject?"" "" What is the hardest thing for you at school?"" "" What is the easiest thing for you at school?"" Understanding how your child and his or her team view your child's strengths and weaknesses can be a big help in the development of the IEP. You should also come prepared with questions for the team, such as how their recommendations will benefit your child and which services will likely be the most effective. After it's written, the IEP will include information about your child's current performance in school. It will also contain a series of annual goals, and each goal will have a set of measurable objectives. Those objectives will be used to determine whether your child has moved toward or reached a particular goal. That way, your child's progress can be assessed each year. The IEP will also identify the special education and services your child will receive. For instance, it could list and describe the assistive-technology devices your child will be able to use. The IEP document will also describe in detail how your child will interact with children who don't have disabilities. In addition, it will specify whether your child needs any modifications to standardized tests. According to the law, the IEP needs to be reviewed annually. The purpose of the review is to assess your child's progress and make any needed modifications in the educational program. How autism hinders a child's educational progress depends on each child. By carefully designing an IEP for autism, it is possible to create a plan that will help your child develop in many ways -- academically, socially and behaviorally. An IEP for a child with ASD might contain goals like the following: Academic: The child will learn new skills, such as adding or subtracting. Social: The child will develop appropriate play skills, such as interacting with classmates during group activities. Behavioral: The child will acquire new coping mechanisms, such as asking for help and replacing problem behaviors, such as yelling or hitting, with socially acceptable ones. Motor: The child will work on ADL skills or handwriting to assist his or her academic progression. In the IEP, each of these goals should be broken down into measurable objectives so that the IEP team will be able to assess your child's progress. For instance, a goal for a child to learn addition and subtraction might contain the following objective: "" The child will correctly subtract two-digit numbers 90% of the time in a one-on-one situation with a special education teacher."" Many children with ASD find it difficult to develop the skills they need. Engaging a child or teen in the IEP process provides an opportunity to teach a child with autism to advocate for himself or herself. For some children, involvement may be limited to attending the IEP meeting. Over time, and depending upon the degree of the disability, some children may be able to take more ownership. When they do, they will more actively participate in designing their IEP for autism. They may be able to identify their own problem areas and help create reasonable goals for themselves. And they may be able to determine which special education services would help them meet their educational potential. Since an Individualized Education Program details the special services to which a child is entitled, it can be used to guarantee that particular areas of deficit will be addressed. If your child needs special services, such as counseling, occupational therapy, or physical therapy, the IEP should include information about the frequency and length of meetings with appropriate professionals and how progress will be assessed. Because the plan is reviewed annually, it can be modified over time to meet your child's changing needs and abilities. An IEP can also help your child make the transition to adulthood. When your child turns 14, the IEP must include information about which academic courses are needed to help your child meet his or her post-high-school goals. At age 16, the IEP must detail which transition services, if any, your child will need in preparation for completing school."
34,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) makes it harder to focus, pay attention, and sit still. Most people who have ADHD are also very sensitive to what other people think or say about them. This is sometimes called rejection sensitive dysphoria ( RSD). "" Dysphoria"" comes from a Greek word that means âhard to bear."" People who have RSD don't handle rejection well. They get very upset if they think someone has shunned or criticized them, even if that's not the case. Up to 99% of teens and adults with ADHD are more sensitive than usual to rejection. And nearly 1 in 3 say it's the hardest part of living with ADHD. People who have the condition sometimes work hard to make everyone like and admire them. Or they might stop trying and stay out of any situation where they might get hurt. This social withdrawal can look like social phobia, which is a serious fear of being embarrassed in public. RSD can affect relationships with family, friends, or a romantic partner. The belief that you're being rejected can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you act differently toward the person you think has rejected you, they may begin to do so for real. People with RSD may: Be easily embarrassed Get very angry or have an emotional outburst when they feel like someone has hurt or rejected them Set high standards for themselves they often can't meet Have low self-esteem Feel anxious, especially in social settings Have problems with relationships Stay away from social situations and withdraw from other people Feel like a failure because they haven't lived up to other people's expectations Sometimes think about hurting themselves Some of these symptoms are also common in other mental health conditions. RSD can be confused with: Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) Depression Social phobia One difference is that RSD episodes are intense but don't last very long. Because RSD can look like other mental health disorders, it's important to get the right diagnosis. If you have ADHD and you've had any of these symptoms, see a psychologist, counselor, or other mental health provider for help. Doctors believe gene changes that are passed down through families cause RSD. Serious trauma -- like abuse or neglect -- can make the symptoms worse. When you have ADHD, your nervous system overreacts to things from the outside world. Any sense of rejection can set off your stress response and cause an emotional reaction that's much more extreme than usual. Sometimes the criticism or rejection is imagined, but not always. ADHD researchers estimate that by age 12, children with ADHD get 20,000 more negative messages about themselves than other kids their age. All that criticism can take a real toll on their self-esteem. Two types of medicine work well to ease symptoms: Guanfacine ( Intuniv) and clonidine ( Kapvay) are drugs that lower blood pressure, but they also help with RSD symptoms. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors like tranylcypromine ( Parnate) treat the inattention, impulsive behaviors, and emotional symptoms of ADHD. Therapy can help with other symptoms of ADHD, but it doesn't do much for RSD. This is because RSD episodes happen suddenly and without warning. But a therapist can help you learn how to get a handle on your emotions and deal with rejection in a more positive way. Another way to deal with RSD is to manage the stress in your life. You're more likely to have an emotional breakdown when you're stressed out. Eat right, sleep well, and do things like yoga or meditation to keep your mind calm."
35,"The term ""phobia"" refers to a group of anxiety symptoms brought on by certain objects or situations. A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapromay have potential value for some patients. More recently, common blood pressure drugs called beta-blockers have been used to treat anxiety related to specific phobias. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms. For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder."
36,"When you have heart failure, your heart may not be strong enough to pump out as much blood as your body needs. As it tries to move more blood, your heart gets larger. It also pumps faster, and your blood vessels narrow to get more blood out to your body. As your heart works harder, it becomes weaker and the damage increases. Your body gets less oxygen, and you might notice symptoms like shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, and fluid buildup. Your body tries to keep the blood it has to supply your heart and brain. This leaves less for organs like your kidneys and liver. A lack of enough blood can damage these organs. You can't cure heart failure, but you can manage it by following your treatment plan. Medicines, diet, exercise, and surgery are just some of the treatments your doctor might suggest to prevent these problems. In a normal heart, the upper chambers (called the atria) and lower chambers (the ventricles) squeeze and relax in turn to move blood through your body. If your ticker is weak, these chambers might not squeeze at the right time. Your heart might beat too slowly, too quickly, or in an irregular pattern. When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body. Atrial fibrillation ( AFib) is one type of abnormal heart rhythm that heart failure can cause. It causes your heart to quiver and skip instead of beating. An irregular heartbeat can cause your blood to pool, which might lead to clots. A clot that forms in a vein is called venous thromboembolism. The clot can break free and travel to your lungs. Then it's called pulmonary embolism. Or a clot can travel to your brain. If it blocks a blood vessel there, you could have a stroke. Your heart has four valves that open and close to keep blood flowing in and out of your heart. As the damage gets worse and your heart has to work harder to pump out blood, it gets bigger. The change in size can damage the valves. Your kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid out of your blood. Just like your other organs, they need a steady supply of blood to work like they should. Without the amount of blood they need, they won't be able to remove enough wastes from your blood. This is called kidney failure. It's treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. Kidney disease can also make your heart failure worse. Damaged kidneys they can't remove as much water from your blood as healthy ones. You'll start to hold onto fluid, which boosts your blood pressure. High blood pressure makes your heart work even harder. This is a lack of the red blood cells that move oxygen to your body's tissues. If you have anemia, your body may not get enough oxygen. Your kidneys make a protein called erythropoietin ( EPO), which helps your body make new red blood cells. Kidney damage from heart failure prevents your body from making enough EPO. Your liver breaks down toxins so your body can remove them. It also stores bile, a fluid used to digest food. Heart failure can rob your liver of the blood it needs to work. The fluid buildup that comes with it puts extra pressure on the portal vein, which brings blood to your liver. This can scar the organ to the point where it doesn't work as well as it should. A damaged heart can't pump blood as effectively from your lungs out to your body. Blood backs up, raising pressure in the veins inside your lungs. This pushes fluid into your air sacs. As liquid builds up, it gets harder to breathe. This is called pulmonary edema. Heart failure can affect muscle and fat metabolism. In the late stages, you might lose a lot of weight and muscle mass. Your muscles can get smaller and weaker. Heart failure will get worse over time if you don't treat it. Severe heart failure can be life threatening. Treatments like weight loss, a healthy diet, exercise, and medicines can protect your heart and keep you healthy. Follow your doctor's advice and stick with your treatment plan. The better you take care of your heart, the less likely you are to have other problems."
37,"Depression is common when you're over age 65, but it can be harder to spot. In part, it's because it often shows up differently when you're older. Even though it's common, it's not a normal part of aging. You can control your symptoms with the right treatment, and live a healthier, fuller life. Other things besides your age raise your chances of depression. You're more likely to have it if you: Have had depression before Are a woman Have a chronic illness like diabetes Are disabled Don't sleep well Spend a lot of time alone Have other people in your family who've had depression Take certain medications Have a disease that affects your brain Abuse alcohol or drugs Are going through a stressful life event Dependence also raises your odds. You're far more likely to be depressed if you need in-home health care or hospital care than if you live in the community. It's common for depression to come with other health issues that often crop up after 65, like: Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease Heart disease Cancer Arthritis Sometimes it can be the medication for the above conditions that's to blame for depression symptoms. Depression can often make these other health conditions worse, and vice versa. Getting your depression under control often improves other medical issues and your overall health. Depression often gets overlooked or misdiagnosed in seniors. When you're older, you may not have the sad or empty feeling that's common with it. Instead, you may: Feel tired Have trouble sleeping Be grumpy or irritable Feel confused Struggle to pay attention Not enjoy activities you used to Move more slowly Have a change in weight or appetite Feel hopeless, worthless, or guilty Endure aches and pains Have suicidal thoughts Sometimes, depression can hit after the death of a spouse. It's normal to grieve, but one-third of widows and widowers have symptoms of it in the first month after their partner dies, and half of them still struggle with it a year later. With the right plan, you can improve your quality of life. The first step is to talk to your doctor. You can see your general physician or a mental health specialist, like a psychiatrist or psychologist. They'll examine you and take your medical history. Different treatments work for different people. Doctors usually recommend a medication, some sort of therapy, or both. The type of medication your doctor prescribes will depend on many things, including your: Symptoms Health Other conditions you have and medications you're taking Meds you may get include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) like: Citalopram ( Celexa) Escitalopram ( Lexapro) Fluoxetine ( Prozac) Paroxetine ( Paxil) Sertraline ( Zoloft) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) like: Desvenlafaxine ( Pristiq) Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Venlafaxine ( Effexor) Atypical antidepressa nts, such as: Bupropion ( Wellbutrin) Trazodone ( Oleptro ER) Mirtazapine ( Remeron) Monamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs), like: Isocarboxazid ( Marplan) Phenelzine ( Nardil) Selegiline ( Emsam, Zelapar, Eldepryl) Tranylcypromine ( Parnate) There's another class of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants, but they aren't used much in older adults because they have more side effects. Talk to your doctor about them. All antidepressants come with side effects, so your doctor will want to monitor how you're doing after you begin treatment. He may need to tweak your dosage or change your medicine altogether. Studies show that psychotherapy, or âtalk therapy,â works to treat mild to moderate depression in older adults just as well as medication. Counseling with a trained professional can help you work through some of the things that trigger your depression. It can also give you tools to deal with it. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT) is a special form of psychotherapy that trains you to turn negative thoughts into positive ones. Problem-solving therapy also helps with older adults. When medication and psychotherapy don't seem to make a difference in your symptoms, your doctor may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It involves passing a brief small electrical current through electrodes placed on your scalp while you are under general anesthesia. This causes a brief seizure. That seizure causes a change to the chemistry in your brain. Researchers believe that change helps with your depression. Doctors usually try medication and therapy for a while before trying ECT. Healthy lifestyle changes can help ward off depression, too. Eat nutritious foods. Get enough exercise. Work some relaxation methods like deep breathing or stretches into your schedule. Together, the combination of medical treatment and a healthier lifestyle can help boost your mood and get you back to feeling like yourself."
38,"Cerebral palsy, or CP, is a group of disorders that affect balance, movement, and muscle tone. â Cerebralâ means the disorder is related to the brain, and âpalsyâ refers to weakness or a muscle problem. CP starts in the area of the brain that controls the ability to move muscles. Cerebral palsy can happen when that part of the brain doesn't develop as it should, or when it is damaged right around the time of birth or very early in life. Most people with cerebral palsy are born with it. That's called âcongenitalâ CP. But it can also start after birth, in which case it's called âacquiredâ CP. People with cerebral palsy can have mild issues with muscle control, or it could be so severe that they can't walk. Some people with CP have difficulty speaking. Others have intellectual disabilities, while many have normal intelligence. Doctors can't always figure out exactly what has happened to damage the brain or disrupt development, causing CP. Some of the problems that can damage the brain or disrupt its growth include: Bleeding in the brain while the baby is in the womb, during birth or afterward A lack of blood flow to important organs Seizures at birth or in the first month of life Some genetic conditions Traumatic brain injuries You may have a condition while you're pregnant that can increase the chances your baby will have CP. Among them are: Being pregnant with multiples, such as twins or triplets Having a health issue such as seizures or a problem with your thyroid gland Having blood that's not compatible with your baby's, which is also called Rh disease Coming in contact with a toxic substance such as mercury, which is found in some kinds of fish Certain infections and viruses, when they strike during pregnancy, can increase the risk your baby will be born with cerebral palsy. They include: Rubella, or German measles, a viral illness that can be prevented with a vaccine Chickenpox, also called varicella (a vaccine can prevent this contagious illness.) Cytomegalovirus, which causes flu-like symptoms in the mother Herpes, which can be passed from mother to unborn child and can damage the baby's developing nervous system Toxoplasmosis, which is carried by parasites found in soil, cat feces and tainted food Syphilis, a sexually transmitted bacterial infection Zika, a virus carried by mosquitoes Just as some illnesses in mothers raise the chances of CP, so do some infections in babies. Here are some of them: Bacterial meningitis. It causes swelling in the brain and tissues around the spinal cord. Viral encephalitis. This also can cause swelling around the brain and spinal cord. Severe jaundice (yellowing of the skin). This condition occurs when excessive bilirubin, a yellow pigment, accumulates in the blood. Certain problems that happen in childbirth can also increase the risk of cerebral palsy. They include: Breech position. This means a baby is settled feet-first rather than headfirst when labor begins. Low birth weight. If your baby is less than 5.5 pounds, the chances for CP go up. Premature birth. This is means anytime under 37 weeks into the pregnancy. Complicated labor and delivery. This means problems with your baby's breathing or circulatory system."
39,"If you've had severe acne, you may have scarring. A wide variety of treatments can help make them less noticeable. A dermatologist (skin doctor) can help you choose the right ones. Your doctor will examine you and suggest a treatment plan. Her recommendations will depend on the type of damage to your skin and how serious it is. Acne leaves three major types of scars: Ice pick: deep but small pits Boxcar: sharp angles and edges; can be shallow or deep Rolling: tend to be wide and shallow (a wavy look) caused by damage under the surface You may need more than one kind of treatment to smooth your skin. Most are done in the doctor's office or as an outpatient procedure at the hospital. Skin resurfacing. The goal is to remove damaged layers of skin so that new, healthy skin appears. There are three major ways your doctor can do this: Laser. A laser creates a more even surface to your skin. Dermabrasion. A rapidly spinning wheel with a rough surface removes damaged skin. Chemical peel. A special type of acid removes the top layer of your skin. This can help with deeper scars. New skin will begin to form about 7 to 10 days after resurfacing. The area may stay pink from several weeks to several months. Fillers. Your doctor puts a filler (collagen or fat) into the damaged area with a needle. It puffs up the skin under the scar to help smooth it out. Because your body slowly absorbs the filler, the process needs to be repeated from time to time. Rolling (or needling). The doctor rolls a device covered in tiny needles over your skin. It's a safe way to stimulate the tissue under it to grow. You may have to do it several times. Surgery. Some people need an operation to remove bad acne scars or cysts. Your doctor cuts away or loosens the scars. The area is then repaired with stitches or a skin graft (skin from another area of the body). PRP. Platelet-rich plasma is taken from your own blood and injected into scars once a month for 4 months. Regardless of which procedure you may be considering, you'll have questions. Make a list and bring it to the appointment. Here are some you may want to ask: Will I need other treatments? Will it hurt? What are the risks? How long before I see a change? Will I need to have the treatment more than once? What can I do (or not do) after surgery? How much does it cost? What will my insurance cover?"
40,"Ductal carcinoma is a common type of breast cancer that starts in cells that line the milk ducts, which carry breast milk to the nipple. There are two types: Invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) Ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), also called intraductal carcinoma The symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments for each are different. Invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) accounts for about 80% of all invasive breast cancers in women and 90% in men. It begins in the cells of a milk duct, then it grows through the duct walls and into the surrounding breast tissue. And it can spread to other parts of your body. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma symptoms include: A lump in your breast Thickened breast skin Rash or redness on your breast Swelling in your breast New pain in your breast Dimpling on your breast or the skin of your nipple Nipple pain Inverted nipple Nipple discharge Lumps under your arm Changes to your breast or nipple that are different from the ones you have with your period IDC is usually found as the result of an unusual mammogram. To diagnose cancer, you'll get a biopsy to collect cells for analysis. The doctor will remove a bit of tissue to look at under a microscope. They can make a diagnosis from the biopsy results. If the biopsy confirms you have cancer, you'll likely have more tests to see how large the tumor is and if it has spread: CT scan. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. PET scan. The doctor injects a radioactive substance called a tracer into your arm. It travels through your body and gets absorbed into the cancer cells. Together with a CT scan, this test can help find cancer in lymph nodes and other areas. MRI. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the breast and other structures inside your body. Bone scan. The doctor injects a tracer into your arm. They take pictures to find out if cancer has traveled to your bones. Chest X-ray. It uses low doses of radiation to make pictures of the inside of your chest. Results from these tests will show the stage of your cancer. Staging is the name for the process doctors use to figure out if and how far breast cancer has spread. Knowing the stage will help guide your treatment. Doctors can use the results from your diagnostic testing to gather information about the tumor. They group it by a system known as TNM: Tumor ( T): How large is the primary tumor? Where is it? Node ( N): Has the tumor spread to your lymph nodes? Where? How much? Metastasis ( M): Has the cancer spread to other body parts? Which ones? How much? To stage your cancer, your doctor combines the TNM results with the tumor grade (how your tumor cells and tissue look under a microscope and your hormone receptor status (if the cancer cells have proteins that respond to the hormones estrogen or progesterone and your HER2 status (whether your cancer is affected by the HER2 gene). Stages include: Stage 0: This is noninvasive cancer. It's only in the ducts and hasn't spread ( Tis, N0, M0). Stage IA: The tumor is small and invasive, but it hasn't spread to your lymph nodes ( T1, N0, M0). Stage IB: Cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. It's larger than 0.2 mm but less than 2 mm in size. There's either no sign of a tumor in the breast or there is, but it's 20 mm or smaller ( T0 or T1, N1, M0). Stage IIA: Any one of these: There's no sign of a tumor in the breast. The cancer has spread to between 1 and 3 underarm lymph nodes, but not to any distant body parts ( T0, N1, M0). The tumor is 20 mm or smaller and has spread to underarm lymph nodes ( T1, N1, M0). The tumor is between 20 mm and 50 mm but hasn't spread to nearby nodes ( T2, N0, M0). Stage IIB: Either of these conditions: The tumor is between 20 mm and 50 mm and has spread to one to three underarm lymph nodes ( T2, N1, M0). The tumor is larger than 50 mm but hasn't spread to underarm lymph nodes ( T3, N0, M0). Stage IIIA: Either of these conditions: Cancer of any size has spread to four to nine underarm lymph nodes or those under your chest wall. It hasn't spread to other body parts ( T0, T1, T2 or T3, N2, M0). A tumor larger than 50 mm has spread to one to three nearby lymph nodes ( T3, N1, M0). Stage IIIB: The tumor: Has spread to the chest wall Has caused swelling or breast sores Has been diagnosed as inflammatory breast cancer May or may not have spread to up to nine lymph nodes under your arm or beneath the chest wall Hasn't spread to other body parts ( T4; N0, N1 or N2; M0) Stage IIIC: A tumor of any size that has spread to 10 or more nearby lymph nodes, breast lymph nodes, and/or lymph nodes under the collarbone. It hasn't spread to other body parts (any T, N3, M0). Stage IV (metastatic): The tumor can be any size and has spread to other organs, like your bones, lungs, brain, liver, distant lymph nodes, or chest wall (any T, any N, M1). Between 5% and 6% of the time, metastatic cancer is discovered upon first diagnosis. Your doctor may call this de novo metastatic breast cancer. More often, it's found after a previous diagnosis of early breast cancer. Recurrent: This is cancer that comes back after treatment. It can be local, regional, and/or distant. If your cancer returns, you'll get another round of tests to learn about the extent of the recurrence. They'll be similar to those at your original diagnosis. Most women with IDC have surgery to remove the cancer. The treatment options are usually: Lumpectomy: The surgeon only removes the tumor and a bit of the tissue around it to help make sure all the cancer cells have been removed. You might hear it called breast-conserving surgery Mastectomy: The surgeon removes an entire breast. Which one you get depends on the size of your tumor and how much it has spread throughout your breast and surrounding lymph nodes. In addition to surgery, other treatments include: Radiation: This usually follows your surgery. Hormone therapy: You'll get it if your cancer is hormone receptor-positive (meaning estrogen helps it grow). These drugs block or lower the amount of estrogen in your body. Chemotherapy: These medications target cancer cells throughout your body. Doctors also use It before surgery to shrink tumors and after to kill any cancer cells left behind. Targeted therapy: These medications block cancer cell growth. You might get them along with chemotherapy. You might get one treatment or a combination. Ductal Carcinoma in Situ ( DCIS), also known as intraductal carcinoma, accounts for one of every five new breast cancer diagnoses. It's an uncontrolled growth of cells within the breast ducts. It's noninvasive, meaning it hasn't grown into the breast tissue outside of the ducts. The phrase ""in situ"" means ""in its original place."" DCIS is the earliest stage at which breast cancer can be diagnosed. It's known as stage 0 breast cancer. The vast majority of women diagnosed with it are cured. Even though it's noninvasive, it can lead to invasive cancer. It's important that women with the disease get treatment. Research shows that the risk of getting invasive cancer is low if you've been treated for DCIS. If it isn't treated, 30% to 50% if women with DCIS will get invasive cancer. The invasive cancer usually develops in the same breast and in the same area as where the DCIS happened. DCIS usually has no symptoms. Most of the time, it's diagnosed by a mammogram. About 80% of cases are found by mammograms. On the mammogram, it appears as a shadowy area. If your mammogram suggests that you may have DCIS, your doctor should order a biopsy to analyze the cells and confirm the diagnosis. Biopsies for DCIS are typically done using needles to remove tissue samples from the breast. If you have DCIS, your doctor may do more tests to gather information about your cancer. These tests may include an ultrasound or MRI. Based on the results of various tests, your doctor will be able to tell the size of your tumor and how much of your breast is affected by the cancer. No two patients are the same. Your doctor will customize your treatment plan based on your test results and medical history. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy. Instead, they have a lumpectomy. Most common is a lumpectomy followed by radiation. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it. Lymph nodes under the arm don't need to be removed as they are with other types of breast cancer. After a lumpectomy, radiation cuts the chances that the cancer will come back. If cancer does return, it's called recurrence. Some women may opt to have a lumpectomy only. Discuss the risks of not having radiation with your doctor before deciding against it. You and your doctors may decide that a mastectomy to remove the breast is the best course of treatment if you have any of the following: A strong family history of breast cancer A gene mutation that makes having breast cancer more likely Very large areas of DCIS DCIS lesions in multiple areas throughout your breast Not being able tolerate radiation therapy You and your treatment team may also consider the use of hormone therapy if the cancer tests positive for hormone receptors. It can cut the chance of getting another breast cancer."
41,"Emotional eating means turning to food for comfort, not because you're hungry. That bag of potato chips and those chocolate chip cookies may appeal when you feel bad. But the relief doesn't last, and it can make you overeat and gain weight. You can learn other ways to manage those feelings, so that you have don't reach for unhealthy foods when you feel sad, stressed, anxious, or angry. When you notice that you are about to eat because you don't feel good, look for healthy things you could do until the urge to eat passes. For instance: Talk to a friend. Read a book or magazine, or listen to music. Go for a walk or jog. Meditate or do deep breathing exercises. Play a game. Do housework, laundry, or yard work. Write an email. Keep a food diary. Write down what and when you eat, and what thoughts or emotions you have at each meal or snack. You may find patterns. For instance, you might notice that you eat for social reasons, such as when other people encourage you to eat or to fit in with a group. You may also want to work with a counselor in ""talk therapy."" It's a good place to plan other ways to handle your emotions and how you relate to food. Sometimes developing alternative habits or distracting yourself from eating isn't enough. Try meditation or counseling, or talk to your doctor to see what resources and techniques they recommend to help you cope with emotional stress. As you learn to practice better coping strategies and to curb emotional eating, remember to reward yourself. By patting yourself on the back for a job well done, you increase the likelihood that you'll maintain your new healthy habits."
42,"Type 2 diabetes can seem overwhelming at times, but you can take control back. It helps to have people who encourage you and show you new ways to manage your diabetes day to day. Put them on your go-to list, and reach out any time you need their insight and motivation. You need a medical team that knows diabetes inside and out. They could include: An endocrinologist, who has a lot of experience working with people who have diabetes An ophthalmologist for your eyes A pharmacist, who's familiar with all your medicines A registered dietitian, who can give you pointers on what to eat A diabetes educator All of these professionals work with you to help you stay well. It helps to talk to someone who can relate to what you're going through, since they have diabetes, too. While support groups are not psychotherapy groups, they can provide you with a safe, accepting place to share your situation and get comfort and encouragement. Type 2 diabetes can affect the entire family. So get them, and your friends, involved. Share with them what you're going through and how you manage your diabetes. For instance, tell them why you have to check your blood sugar regularly, or what sorts of snacks and meals are OK for you. Want someone to help you get them up to speed? You might want to hold a family meeting, and invite your diabetes educator to answer their questions. You deserve to feel good emotionally. If you don't, you may want to talk to a therapist. In therapy, you'll plan positive ways to handle your diabetes. It's not just for people with conditions like depression or anxiety. Anyone can benefit. You can get a fresh point of view that helps you work through your challenges. That's important, because stress can affect your blood sugar levels. Look for a licensed mental health professional who works with people who have diabetes or other long-term conditions. Ask your doctor for referrals. Pick someone you find easy to talk to. You might meet with your counselor one on one, with family members, or in a support group."
43,"It's easy to mix up these conditions, because their names sound a lot alike. But inflammatory bowel disease (commonly called IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (shortened to IBS) aren't the same. Both can cause stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. But that's where the similarities end. IBS and IBD have different causes and treatments. You can't tell which it is by how you feel, and you need to know the difference so you can get the right type of help. IBD is a structural disease. That means there is underlying physical damage that causes your symptoms. Doctors can see chronic inflammation or ulcers when they examine the gut with an X-ray, endoscopy, surgery, or biopsy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases. IBS, on the other hand, is what doctors call a functional disease. Someone with this type of disease will have a group of symptoms, but tests won't show any physical explanation for those problems. Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. Plus, they both tend to be diagnosed in young people. IBS can also cause constipation, extra gas, nausea, or make you feel like you urgently need to have a bowel movement. But other symptoms are unique to IBD, caused by the inflammation in your gut. They include: Blood in your stools or black stools Weight loss or loss of appetite Progressively worsening symptoms Fever Inflammation in the skin, joints, or eyes If you notice these red flags, your doctor will likely suspect that you have IBD or another structural disease -- not IBS. Doctors use something called the â Rome criteriaâ to decide if you have irritable bowel syndrome. According to the criteria, you may be diagnosed with IBS if you have belly pain for at least 1 day a week for the previous 3 months. The pain must also meet at least two of the following: It is associated with a bowel movement. When it starts, you begin to have bowel movements more or less often. Your stools look different when it begins. In some cases, doctors will diagnose you with IBS just using these standards. But in many cases, especially if you also have other symptoms that hint at IBD, you'll get tests to find out whether there's any bleeding or inflammation in your digestive tract. If there is, then you don't have IBS. Since it's a structural disease, a doctor needs to find physical damage in your gut to make the diagnosis. To look for inflammation, ulcers, and bleeding, you may get: Tests of your blood and stools A colonoscopy or other imaging tests to look inside your gut, with a biopsy CT scans If you have inflammation and ulcers, your doctor can use these tests to narrow down what form of IBD you have. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types. Doctors understand better what causes the two conditions, since they have physical signs to help them. The long-lasting inflammation in the digestive tracts of people with IBD can cause bleeding and ulcers (sores). In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. The causes of IBS aren't as clear. Scientists have found links between irritable bowel syndrome and the immune system, and how muscles move food through the gut. Many people have certain triggers that cause their symptoms to get worse, including some foods, stress, infections, and hormonal changes. People with IBS often try to treat it by changing what they eat. There is no specific diet that works for everyone who has the condition. But you could ask your doctor if it would help to: Get more fiber (from food or supplements). Stop lactose, which is in dairy products. Cut down on foods that make you gassy or bloated. Get more water. ( You can drink it or eat H2 O-rich foods.) Avoid caffeine and legumes (beans). Limit or avoid â FODMAPsâ (a certain type of sugar found in some fruit, vegetable, bread and dairy products). Your doctor may also prescribe drugs to help with diarrhea or constipation if you need more relief. Other things that can help include stress management, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and relaxation training. Researchers are also studying whether probiotics help tame IBS. Counseling is also helpful, especially if the stress of having the condition starts to get to you, or if you notice you're limiting your social life because you worry about when your symptoms will affect you. A support group is another great resource, because the people there will understand, from personal experience, what it's like to have IBS. IBD, on the other hand, is more often treated with drugs that target the inflammation that causes symptoms. These powerful meds generally don't work as a treatment for IBS, which is one reason why it's so important to know which condition you have. And while some people with IBD need surgery to repair the physical damage to their digestive tract, surgery isn't needed for IBS. Lastly, an inflammatory bowel disease makes you more likely to get colorectal cancer. Irritable bowel syndrome doesn't do that, but you should still keep up with your regularly scheduled screening tests."
44,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a leading cause of kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels and filters in the kidney, making removal of waste from the body difficult. Once a person is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, dialysis -- a blood-cleansing process -- or kidney transplantation are necessary. The symptoms of kidney disease include: High/worsening blood pressure Decrease in amount of urine or difficulty urinating Edema (fluid retention), especially in the lower legs A need to urinate more often, especially at night As with high blood pressure, you may not realize that you have kidney disease. Certain laboratory tests can indicate whether your kidneys are eliminating waste products properly. These tests include serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ( BUN); elevated levels of either can indicate kidney damage. Proteinuria, an excess of protein in the urine, is also a sign of kidney disease. Kidney disease caused by high blood pressure affects every group and race. However, certain groups are at higher risk, including: African- Americans Hispanic- Americans Native Americans Natives of Alaska People who have diabetes People with a family history of high blood pressure and kidney disease To prevent kidney damage from high blood pressure: Try to keep your blood pressure controlled. Make sure you get your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. Eat a proper diet. Get moderate exercise, such as walking, 30 minutes daily. Take the medication your doctor prescribes. For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease, the most important treatment is to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB) drugs lower blood pressure and can protect the kidneys from further damage, but treatments need to be individualized."
45,"Flaxseed has been used as a traditional food and remedy in Mediterranean cultures for thousands of years. It's now popular in the U. S. for many different health conditions. Flaxseed oil is made from crushed flaxseed. It shares some -- but not all -- of flaxseed's health properties. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil contain alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA), one of the essential omega-3 fatty acids that partly and inefficiently converts into DHA and EPA -- more active omega-3s -- in the body. While flaxseed hasn't yet been shown to improve heart disease risk, there's good evidence that flaxseed and flaxseed oil may lower cholesterol levels. Ground flaxseed -- but not flaxseed oil -- may also help with menopausal symptoms. One study showed that 40 grams per day may be similar to hormone therapy for improving mild menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. But other studies contradict this finding. Ground flaxseed may also ease constipation. Flaxseed has also been shown to improve kidney function in people with lupus. If you have lupus -- or any other medical condition -- it's very important to talk with your doctor about any supplements you take. Flaxseed oil, like fish oil, has been studied for lowering triglycerides. However, most studies show they do not affect triglyceride levels and may even raise them. Flaxseed is being studied for many other conditions, ranging from cancer to diabetes to osteoporosis. At this point, there is not enough evidence to support flaxseed for these conditions. There is no set dose of flaxseed. In studies of people with high cholesterol, 15 to 50 grams of flaxseed per day has been used; 40 grams have been used for mild menopause symptoms. Flaxseed must be ground prior to ingestion or it won't work for these conditions. Ask your doctor for advice. Flaxseed can be mixed with liquid or food, such as muffins or bread. To be absorbed, however, it must me ground before using it to allow the oils to be available. Some people use a small coffee grinder to grind daily doses as needed. While no other food sources contain flaxseed, flaxseed is itself sometimes added to foods. Ground flaxseed is sold as flour. Flaxseed oil might be added to salad dressing, but it should not be used for cooking. Side effects. At normal doses, flaxseed and flaxseed oil seem to be safe. Flaxseed -- and not flaxseed oil -- contains soluble fiber. It might cause diarrhea, cramping, gas, and bloating. High doses of flaxseed, especially when not taken with enough water, can cause constipation and, rarely, bowel obstruction. If ground flaxseed or flaxseed oil oxidizes (goes rancid), it may cause cholesterol problems and inflammation. Interactions. If you take any medicines or other supplements regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using flaxseed. Flaxseed may block the normal absorption of medicines. Always take medicines at least one hour before or two hours after using flaxseed. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil may also interact with drugs like blood thinners, NSAID painkillers, hormone treatments, and some medicines for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. Use caution when taking flaxseed or flaxseed oil with other supplements. Risks. Never eat raw or unripe flaxseed -- it could be poisonous. People who have diabetes, bipolar disorder, high triglycerides, bleeding disorders, or prostate cancer should talk to a doctor before using flaxseed or flaxseed oil. Anyone with digestive problems (like Crohn's disease, IBS, or colitis) and women with hormone-sensitive diseases (like endometriosis, PCOS, breast cancer, and uterine cancer) should not use flaxseed. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, flaxseed and flaxseed oil is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
46,"When a woman has vaginismus, her vagina's muscles squeeze or spasm when something is entering it, like a tampon or a penis. It can be mildly uncomfortable, or it can be painful.  There are exercises a woman can do that can help, sometimes within weeks. Painful sex is often a woman's first sign that she has vaginismus. The pain happens only with penetration. It usually goes away after withdrawal, but not always. Women have described the pain as a tearing sensation or a feeling like the man is ""hitting a wall."" Many women who have vaginismus also feel discomfort when inserting a tampon or during a doctor's internal pelvic exam. Doctors don't know exactly why vaginismus happens. It's usually linked to anxietyand fear of having sex. But it's unclear which came first, the vaginismus or the anxiety. Some women have vaginismus in all situations and with any object. Others have it only in certain circumstances, like with one partner but not others, or only with sexual intercourse but not with tampons or during medical exams. Other medical problems like infections can also cause painful intercourse. So it's important to see a doctor to determine the underlying cause of pain during sex. Women with vaginismus can do exercises, in the privacy of their own home, to learn to control and relax the muscles around the vagina. The approach is called progressive desensitization, and the idea is to get comfortable with insertion. First, do Kegel exercises by squeezing the same muscles you use to stop the flow of urine when urinating: Squeeze the muscles. Hold for 2 to 10 seconds. Relax the muscles. Do about 20 Kegels at a time. You can do them as many times a day as you want to. After a few days, insert one finger, up to about the first knuckle joint, inside the vagina while doing the exercises. It's a good idea to clip your fingernails first and use a lubricating jelly. Or do the exercises in a bathtub, where water is a natural lubricant. Start with one finger and work your way up to three. You'll feel the vagina's muscles contracting around your finger, and you can always take your finger out if you're not comfortable. For women whose vaginismus is related to fear or anxiety, therapy helps."
47,"The small hazards that can lead to minor cuts and scrapes are a part of everyday life. All it takes is one slip of focus while slicing bread and you've cut your finger. Or you trip on a curb and skin your knee. Get immediate medical attention for a wound that is deep, bleeds heavily, or has something embedded in it. If it's a minor cut or scrape, here's what to do: Clean the Cut First wash your hands with soap and water. Then rinse the cut or scrape with cool water to remove dirt and debris. Hold the area under running water or pour clean water over it from a cup. Use soap to clean the wound. You don't need to use stronger cleaning solutions -- such as hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol -- to treat minor cuts and scrapes, as they may irritate the wound. Cool clean water should be fine for cleaning the wound. Stop the Bleeding A small amount of blood can help clean out the wound. Smaller cuts and abrasions usually stop bleeding on their own. A cut to the head or hand may bleed more because those areas have a lot of blood vessels. To stop the bleeding, gently apply firm, direct pressure using a clean cloth or gauze. Continue to hold the pressure steadily. Don't raise the cloth or gauze to check on the wound, because that could cause the wound to start bleeding again. If blood seeps through the dressing, just put more on top and keep applying pressure. If the cut is on your hand or arm, you can help slow the bleeding by raising it above your head. If the cut spurts blood or if it doesn't stop bleeding, get medical help right away. When to Call the Doctor Most minor cuts and abrasions don't need a doctor's care. But call your doctor if: The wound is on your face. The edges of the cut are jagged or gape open, the cut is deep (1/4 inch or more), or you can see fat or muscle. These are signs that you may need stitches. You can't get all of the dirt or debris out of the wound, or the wound was caused by something very dirty or rusty. You have a puncture wound or a cut and haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years. The wound is from an animal or human bite. The injured area feels numb. Cover the Cut or Scrape Once the bleeding has stopped and the wound is clean, you should cover it with a sterile bandage or gauze pad and tape. If the cut is small and is in an area that won't get dirty and be rubbed by your clothes, you may decide to leave it uncovered. But for most wounds, it's a good idea to cover them to help prevent infection or reopening the wound. Change the dressing or bandage every day or more often if it gets dirty. Antibiotic ointment can make infection less likely. Using a thin layer of antibiotic ointment before applying the bandage or gauze dressing will help keep cuts and scrapes clean and moist, and help curb scarring. Watch for Signs of Infection If the wound isn't healing or you notice any of these signs of infection, call your doctor right away: Redness, swelling, and warmth Increasing pain Pus or drainage from the cut Fever Red streaks around the wound When the Wound Starts to Heal Small cuts and scrapes will form a scab and heal within a few days. The scab helps protect the wound from dirt and germs while new skin grows underneath. Once a scab has formed, you may not need to use a bandage anymore. Although a healing wound or scab will itch, it's best not to scratch or pick at scabs. The scab will fall off on its own without your help, revealing the new skin underneath."
48,"Diaper rash appears on the skin under a diaper. Diaper rash typically occurs in infants and children younger than 2 years, but the rash can also be seen in people who are incontinent or paralyzed. Almost every baby will get diaper rash at least once during the first 3 years of life, with the majority of these babies 9-12 months old. This is the time when the baby is still sitting most of the time and is also eating solid foods, which may change the acidity of the bowel movements. Friction: Most diaper rash is caused by friction that develops when sensitive baby skin is rubbed by wet diapers. This results in a red, shiny rash on exposed areas. Irritation: The skin under the diaper gets red from irritants such as feces, urine, or cleaning agents. Irritation can be caused by the diaper or by the acid in urine and bowel movements. This rash appears red in the area where the diaper has rubbed and is normally not seen in the folds of the skin. Candidal infection: The rash of a candidal infection, also known as fungal or yeast infection, usually has a bright, beefy red appearance and is very common after the use of antibiotics. Candida is a fungal microorganism that is typically found in warm, moist places such as in the mouth. In fact, Candida is the same organism that causes thrush. Allergic reaction: The rash may be a reaction to diaper wipes, diapers, laundry detergent, soap, lotion, or the elastic in plastic pants. Seborrhea: This is an oily, yellow-colored rash that may also be seen in other areas of the body, such as the face, head, and neck. Although less common, diaper rash can be caused by bacteria like staph. Identifying a diaper rash is usually fairly easy. The rash is located on skin underneath the diaper area. The skin is red and irritated. It may appear all over your baby's bottom or genital area, or only in certain places. It may or may not involve the folds of the skin. It is usually not necessary to call the doctor for a simple diaper rash. Keeping the diaper area clean and dry should prevent most diaper rashes. However, even the best prevention is sometimes not enough. Call your doctor if these conditions develop: The rash does not get better despite treatment with over-the-counter medicines in 4-7 days. The rash is getting significantly worse or has spread to other parts of the body. The rash appears also to have a bacterial infection, with symptoms such as a pus-like drainage or yellowish-colored crusting, or if fevers develop with the rash. This is called impetigo and needs to be treated with antibiotics. You are not certain what may be causing the rash. You suspect the rash could be from an allergy. The doctor can help you pinpoint the possible allergen. The rash is accompanied by diarrhea continuing for more than 48 hours. It is very rare to need to go to the hospital for diaper rash. However, should your child appear to be in severe pain, or if you notice rapid spread of the rash with fever, you should seek medical attention. Diagnosis is typically based on a history and physical examination of the rash. It is usually not necessary to perform lab testing. If the rash appears to be caused by an allergic response, your doctor may perform skin testing to determine the specific allergy-causing agent. Proper skin care is one of the most important treatments for diaper rash. The following techniques may help alleviate or shorten the duration of diaper rash. Diapers should be changed more often than normal. Skin should be washed with a very mild soap and air dried or lightly patted dry. The skin should be cleaned, but avoid any rough scrubbing, which could lead to further skin irritation. After cleaning, the skin should be exposed to air, leaving the diaper off for several hours if possible. Avoiding wipes during this time is helpful, as the alcohol in wipes may be irritating. You may want to consider using plain water to clean the skin. If you use cloth diapers, avoid using plastic pants during this time. Certain foods may seem to worsen the rash. If this is the case, avoid these foods until the rash has cleared. If the rash is caused by a contact or allergic dermatitis, stop using any new soaps or detergents that may be causing the rash. If the rash appears to be caused by a candidal infection, it may be treated with topical, over-the-counter antifungal creams. Topical steroids can be used for diaper rash caused by allergic, atopic, or seborrheic causes but should not be used for fungal infections. Zinc oxide may also be effective, especially as a barrier. If the child (or adult) appears to have a candidal infection, the doctor may recommend antifungal creams or medicines. If the child has impetigo (a bacterial infection), antibiotics may be prescribed. Your doctor may recommend a short course of mild topical steroid cream or ointment if the rash does not appear to be a fungal infection. Prevention is the most effective way to treat diaper rash. Diapers today are highly absorbent and can wick away excess moisture from the skin. However, it is still a good idea to change the diapers every few hours to prevent urine or feces from coming into contact with skin. Before putting on a new diaper, be sure that the skin is dry and clean. When applying the diaper, avoid tape adhering to the skin, because this can also lead to breakdown and irritate the skin. Good handwashing is a must to help prevent infections of all kinds. Diaper rash usually goes away on its own. In addition, a child will stop having episodes of diaper rash once potty-training has been successfully completed and the child no longer wears a diaper. diaper rash, diaper dermatitis, yeast infection, candidal infection, candidiasis"
49,"Occupational asthma is asthma caused by, or worsened by, exposure to substances in the workplace. These substances may cause asthma in one of 3 ways: An allergic reaction (like people with allergies who develop allergic asthma) An irritant reaction (like a person that reacts to smoking with asthma) A reaction which results in the buildup of naturally occurring chemicals such as histamines in the lungs resulting in an asthma attack Examples of occupational asthma -- also called work-related asthma -- include: Health care workers who develop an allergy to latex gloves by breathing in the powdered proteins from the inner lining of the gloves Workers in the chemical industry who are exposed to substances like ammonia and develop symptoms of asthma as the result of an irritant effects, not an allergic reaction There are numerous substances used in various industries that can trigger occupational asthma including: Chemicals such as adhesives, shellac and lacquer, plastics, epoxy resins, carpeting, foam and rubber, insulation, dyes (textile workers), and enzymes in detergents Proteins in animal hair and/or dander Grains, green coffee beans, and papain (an extract of papaya that may trigger a latex allergy) Cotton, flax, and hemp dust, commonly found in the textile industry Metals such as platinum, chromium, nickel sulfate, and soldering fumes Generally, if your asthma symptoms are worse on days that you work, improve when you are at home for any length of time (weekends, vacations) and then recur when you return to work, occupational asthma should be considered. Symptoms of occupational asthma include general symptoms of an asthma attack, such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulty. Eye irritation, nasal congestion, and/or runny nose may also be present. As stated previously, this can be allergy-related or an irritant reaction from exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace. If you think you have occupational asthma, ask your health care provider about a referral to an asthma specialist. The specialist will perform a detailed exam, including taking your past medical history and reviewing current breathing problems. After any necessary asthma tests, the specialist will develop an asthma treatment plan, which will include asthma medications, such as bronchodilators, asthma inhalers, and inhaled steroids to control your asthma. It will also be important to avoid any asthma triggers at work. Preventing asthma symptoms by reducing exposure to the triggers at work is the most important step you can take to reduce the occurrence of occupational asthma. It's also important to use appropriate asthma medication to prevent symptoms. Even with the right asthma medications, continued exposure at work can make asthma more difficult to control. OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) is a government agency that has created guidelines that determine acceptable levels of exposure to substances that may cause asthma. Employers are required to follow these rules. However, if in a particular job, exposure to asthma triggers is unavoidable, most employers are willing to assist the employee to find a more suitable workplace. Once it has been determined what causes your asthma, discuss with your health care provider how best to approach your employer and what precautions need to be taken."
50,"Thirty minutes have passed since you ate a bowl of ice cream, and now your stomach is cramping and gassy. You feel like you might have diarrhea. Does this sound like you? Or, you had milk, mashed potatoes, or even candy almost 2 hours ago and have these symptoms. Does that sound like you? If either does, you could have lactose intolerance. Lactose is the main sugar in milk and most other dairy products. Your small intestine makes the enzyme lactase to help you digest that sugar. When you're lactose intolerant, you don't make enough lactase to digest lactose well. You can't cure lactose intolerance, but if you change what and how you eat, you may get rid of your symptoms. Millions of Americans have symptoms of lactose intolerance: Bloating Cramps Diarrhea Painful gas Nausea You can use trial and error to find out what foods cause symptoms, and in what amount. And then check in with your doctor for a diagnosis. You may be sensitive to small amounts of foods that have lactose, or you may only have symptoms if you eat a lot of lactose foods. Your symptoms may be severe or mild. Lactose intolerance is different for everyone. Milk and dairy products are the best-known lactose foods, but there are many others. Some nondairy products have a protein called casein, which can have traces of lactose. To avoid symptoms from lactose intolerance, read food labels carefully. When shopping or cooking, look for these ingredients that have lactose: Curds Dry milk solids Milk Milk byproducts Dry milk powder Whey If you are highly sensitive to lactose, you may need to avoid foods such as: Baked goods Bread, baking, and pancake mixes Breakfast cereals Certain types of candy, such as milk chocolate Instant foods (breakfast drink mixes, mashed potatoes, soups, and meal replacement drinks) Margarine Nondairy creamers (liquid and powdered) Nondairy whipped topping Processed meats (bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and lunch meats) Protein and meal replacement bars Salad dressing Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of the foods you eat, to note when you have symptoms, and to stop eating an offending food to see if your symptoms go away. To help make a diagnosis, some doctors simply look at your symptoms and whether avoiding dairy products for 2 weeks relieves them. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may do other tests, such as: Hydrogen breath test. Normally, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. If your body doesn't digest lactose, though, hydrogen builds in your intestines, and after a while it's in your breath. This test measures how much hydrogen is in your breath after you have a lactose-loaded drink several times in a few hours. If your levels are high 3 to 5 hours later, your body does not digest lactose well. Lactose tolerance test. When your body breaks down lactose, it releases sugar into your blood. This tests how much sugar is in your blood. After you fast, a small sample of blood is taken. Then, you drink a liquid that is high in lactose. Two hours later, you give another blood sample. Because lactose causes blood sugar levels to rise, your blood sugar levels in this sample should be higher. If you're lactose intolerant, you'll have just a low rise in blood sugar. You can't change how well your body digests lactose, but you can cut or even stop your symptoms. Talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian who can help you plan a healthy diet that keeps you feeling good. Keep a food diary to help you learn how much (if any) dairy you can eat without having symptoms. Many people don't need to stop eating all dairy. If you make small changes in what you eat, you may be able to prevent symptoms by helping your body digest dairy foods easier. Don't eat dairy alone. It's easier for your body to digest lactose when you eat it with other foods. So try having small amounts of milk or dairy foods with meals. Choose easier-to-digest dairy products. Some people find it easier to digest dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Use lactose-free or reduced-lactose milk and dairy products. You can find dairy products with most of the lactose removed, or lactase added, at many grocery stores. Switch to dairy-free products. There are many nondairy options, such as almond, rice, or soy milks. Special note about infants and young children: When babies have symptoms of lactose intolerance, many children's doctors advise changing from cow's milk formula to soy milk formula until the symptoms go away, then slowly adding cow's milk formula and dairy products back into their diets. Take a lactase enzyme replacement. These are available over the counter in pills or capsules. Take the advised dose with your first drink or bite of dairy to help prevent lactose intolerance symptoms."
51,"If your child has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), your doctor will probably recommend behavioral therapy as a treatment. No matter how old your child is, experts say it's the first step toward successfully managing ADHD symptoms. Behavioral therapy isn't psychotherapy or play therapy. It focuses on actions, not emotions. It can teach your child how to turn negative, disruptive energy into positive thoughts and actions. And it starts at home -- with you, the parent. In general, doctors recommend behavioral therapy as soon as your child is diagnosed with ADHD. The CDC says it is the preferred first treatment for all kids with ADHD, regardless of their age. If your child is diagnosed during preschool (age 4 or 5), it's usually the only treatment used. Studies show behavioral therapy works as well as medication in young kids. If your preschooler doesn't get better or has symptoms that are moderate or severe, then his doctor may prescribe medication. The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) recommends behavioral therapy along with medication for children ages 6 and older. The combined treatment is sometimes referred to as a âmultimodal approach.â The primary caregivers for behavioral therapy are the adults who are raising the child. Other people who spend time with your child, such as teachers or caregivers, help too. The idea is to surround your kid with people who will consistently and effectively encourage positive behavior and discourage the not-so-good stuff. Some parents choose an ADHD behavioral therapist, but you don't have to go to a special counselor. There are ADHD behavior therapy classes that train parents. Ask your child's doctor if classes are available in your area. They are sometimes listed under names such as: Behavioral management training for parents Behavioral parent training Parent behavior training Parent training During class, a therapist teaches you how to set and stick to rules and how to respond to ADHD behaviors. Classes usually take place once a week for about 3 to 4 months. Research shows that this training not only helps nix your child's negative behavior, it'll bring the two of you closer together. Children with ADHD often have trouble sitting still. They can be impulsive and fidgety. That can make it hard for them to pay attention. It can also be disruptive in classrooms and at home. Behavioral therapy teaches your child skills that will help him. They: Strengthen good behaviors Limit disruptive behaviors Teach a child to how to express feelings in a peaceful way It starts with three basic steps: Set a clear goal for your child. Be specific and reasonable. Make sure your child understands what he is supposed to do. For example, complete a homework assignment by a certain time. Be consistent with rewards and consequences. Always reward your child for showing good behavior. Make sure he knows the consequence for unwanted behavior. And follow through on it. Use the rewards/consequence system consistently for his whole childhood. Doing so builds positive behavior. Specific behavioral therapy techniques include: Positive reinforcement: Reward your child for good behavior. Example: If you finish your homework properly and on time, you can play a video game. Token economy: This combines the reward and consequence ideas. Teachers often use this method by giving out things like star stickers, but the same principle should be used at home, too. Response cost: Unwanted behavior leads to a loss of privileges or rewards. Example: If you don't do your homework, you lose your computer time. Time out: This common consequence is often used when preschoolers use bad behavior. Example: If you hit your sister, you must sit quietly alone for a few minutes. Teachers may use words to praise your child or provide calming objects that they can hold quietly while still paying attention to the lesson. For older kids, the teacher may use hand signals to communicate privately with the child during class. Other techniques at school, called accommodations, include: A different location for taking quizzes and tests Moving your child's desk Longer test-taking times Modified homework assignments Social skills classes, special education, or a behavioral plan Allowing âescape valveâ outlets (running an errand to the library for the teacher, etc.) Selectively ignoring poor behavior Removing nuisance items such as rubber bands or other distracting materials Used with or without medication, behavioral therapy can help your child curb symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness. It can help your child do better in school, but you have to stick with it and be consistent. Remember that it takes time to learn new skills. Don't expect changes right away. Behavior improvements may be slow at first. But with patience, persistence, and teamwork, it should get better."
52,"If you're a woman with infertility issues, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help you get pregnant. These meds, called fertility drugs, work by causing your body to release hormones that trigger or regulate ovulation -- the release of an egg from your ovary. Even if you already use another method to boost your chances of getting pregnant, such as in vitro fertilization, fertility drugs are still an important part of treatment. There are lots of these drugs, but here are the basics on the ones that are most commonly prescribed. Clomiphene citrate ( Clomid) has been used for more than 40 years. Your doctor may prescribe it if you're not ovulating normally. Clomid and Serophene, the brand names of clomiphene, are known as estrogen-blocking drugs. They cause the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, located in your brain, to release hormones called Gn RH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). These hormones trigger your ovaries to make eggs. These drugs are often used along with other fertility methods, like assisted reproductive techniques or artificial insemination. How you use it: The typical starting dosage of clomiphene is 50 milligrams a day for 5 days. You usually take the first pill on the third, fourth, or fifth day after you start your period. You can expect to start ovulating about 7 days after you've taken the last dose. If it doesn't happen right away, your doctor may ask you to increase your dose by 50 milligrams a day each month, up to 150 milligrams. After you start to ovulate, most doctors suggest taking clomiphene for no longer than 6 months. If you haven't become pregnant after half a year, your doctor will probably prescribe a different medication or suggest that you see an infertility specialist. How well it works: About 60% to 80% of women who take clomiphene will ovulate, and about half will be able to get pregnant. Most pregnancies happen within three cycles. Side effects: They're generally mild. They include hot flashes, blurred vision, nausea, bloating, and headache. Clomid can also cause changes in your cervical mucus, which may make it harder to tell when you're fertile and may stop sperm from getting into your uterus. Like many fertility drugs, Clomid can raise your chance of multiple births. If Clomid on its own doesn't work, your doctor may recommend hormones to trigger ovulation. Some of the types are: Human chorionic gonadotropin (h CG), such as Novarel, Ovidrel, Pregnyl, and Profasi. This medication is usually used along with other fertility drugs to trigger your ovaries to release an egg. Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH), such as Bravelle, Fertinex, Follistim, and Gonal- F. These drugs trigger the growth of eggs in your ovaries. Human menopausal gonadotropin (h MG), such as Menopur, Metrodin, Pergonal, and Repronex. This drug combines FSH and LH (luteinizing hormone). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( Gn RH), such as Factrel and Lutrepulse. This hormone triggers the release of FSH and LH from your pituitary gland, but it's rarely prescribed in the U. S. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( Gn RH agonist), such as Lupron, Synarel, and Zoladex. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist ( Gn RH antagonist), such as Antagon and Cetrotide. These drugs aren't pills that you swallow. Instead, you take them as shots. The dose varies, depending on how they're being used. Some are given beneath the skin, while others are injected into the muscle. You can get the injections on your stomach, upper arm, upper thigh, or buttocks. You usually start taking them during your cycle, the second or third day after you see bright red blood, and continue taking them for 7 to 12 straight days. Sometimes, you may need to get injections along with Clomid that you take by mouth. How well it works: As with clomiphene, injected hormones have a high rate of success in helping you to ovulate. Among women who do start to ovulate, as many as 50% are able to get pregnant. Side effects: Most are mild and include problems like tenderness, infection, and blood blisters, swelling, or bruising at the injection site. There's also a risk of a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation, which makes your ovaries grow and become tender. The drugs also raise your chances of multiple births. Antagon ( ganirelix acetate). It's an injected drug that can prevent early ovulation in women who are having fertility procedures. Side effects can include stomach pain, headache, and possibly the loss of your pregnancy. Dostinex ( cabergoline ) and Parlodel ( bromocriptine ). These are medications used to lower certain hormone levels and reduce the size of a pituitary tumor that may be causing your ovulation troubles. You usually take them by mouth in small doses, but the amount can be increased if your doctor says so. Side effects include dizziness and upset stomach."
53,"Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth structure and can affect both the enamel (the outer coating of the tooth) and the dentin layer of the tooth. Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as breads, cereals, milk, soda, fruits, cakes, or candy are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities. To prevent tooth decay: Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride-containing toothpaste. Preferably, brush after each meal and especially before going to bed. Clean between your teeth daily with dental floss or interdental cleaners, such as the Oral- B Interdental Brush, Reach Stim- U- Dent, or Sulcabrush. Rinse daily with a fluoride-containing mouthwash. Some rinses also have antiseptic ingredients to help kill bacteria that cause plaque. Eat nutritious and balanced meals and limit snacks. Avoid carbohydrates such as candy, pretzels and chips, which can remain on the tooth surface. If sticky foods are eaten, brush your teeth soon afterwards. Check with your dentist about use of supplemental fluoride, which strengthens your teeth. Ask your dentist about dental sealants (a plastic protective coating) applied to the chewing surfaces of your back teeth (molars) to protect them from decay. Drink fluoridated water. At least a pint of fluoridated water each day is needed to protect children from tooth decay. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exam. Researchers are developing new means to prevent tooth decay. One study found that a chewing gum that contains the sweetener xylitol temporarily retarded the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, several materials that slowly release fluoride over time, which will help prevent further decay, are being explored. These materials would be placed between teeth or in pits and fissures of teeth. Toothpastes and mouth rinses that can reverse and ""heal"" early cavities are also being studied."
54,"Paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as doctors now call it, is the most common example of this mental illness. Schizophrenia is a kind of psychosis, which means your mind doesn't agree with reality. It affects how you think and behave. This can show up in different ways and at different times, even in the same person. The illness usually starts in late adolescence or young adulthood. People with paranoid delusions are unreasonably suspicious of others. This can make it hard for them to hold a job, run errands, have friendships, and even go to the doctor. Although it's a lifelong illness, you can take medicines and find help to stop symptoms or make them easier to live with. Delusions are fixed beliefs that seem real to you, even when there's strong evidence they aren't. Paranoid delusions, also called delusions of persecution, reflect profound fear and anxiety along with the loss of the ability to tell what's real and what's not real. They might make you feel like: A co-worker is trying to hurt you, like poison your food. Your spouse or partner is cheating on you. The government is spying on you. People in your neighborhood are plotting to harass you. These beliefs can cause trouble in your relationships. And if you think that strangers are going to hurt you, you may feel like staying inside or being alone. People with schizophrenia aren't usually violent. But sometimes, paranoid delusions can make them feel threatened and angry. If someone is pushed over the edge, their actions usually focus on family members, not the public, and it happens at home. You could also have related hallucinations, in which your senses aren't working right. For example, you may hear voices that make fun of you or insult you. They might also tell you to do harmful things. Or you might see things that aren't really there. Your doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic drug to make the delusions go away. It could be pills, a liquid, or shots. It can take a few weeks for these drugs to work fully, but you could start to feel a little calmer quickly. You might need to try more than one to find a medication or combination that's right for you. Even when you feel better, keep taking your medicine. If you stop, your delusions will probably come back. Avoid using marijuana, alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, or other stimulants. They can keep antipsychotic drugs from working well. They can also cause paranoia or make it worse. You might have to take different kinds of drugs for other symptoms, too. Once your delusions are under control, counseling can help you get along with others, hold a job, go to school, take care of yourself, and have friends. People with schizophrenia who get counseling are also more likely to stick with their medications. A kind of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy can teach you how to manage symptoms that don't go away, even when you take your medicine. You'll learn to test whether you're having delusions and how to ignore voices inside your head. Positive, encouraging support from family and friends really helps, too. Because some antipsychotic drugs can make you gain weight, you might also want to get help with diet and exercise. There might be times when your paranoid delusions or other symptoms are so severe that you have to go to the hospital. You'll be cared for so you and your loved ones stay safe. If you recognize that you're having trouble, you can be admitted voluntarily. But if you think you don't need help when you really do, the law may allow a doctor or other mental health professional to admit you involuntarily if you are unable to care for yourself or may be dangerous to yourself or someone else."
55,"If you have a bladder tumor, your doctor may recommend a transurethral resection ( TUR). It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. Doctors also take out tumors this way. You first may need a blood test and chest X-ray to make sure you're healthy enough to have TUR surgery, but your surgeon won't need to make a cut into your skin. He'll get to your bladder through your urethra -- the tube pee goes through as it passes out of your body. Before the surgery, you'll have either general anesthesia -- which puts you to sleep -- or regional anesthesia that numbs just the lower part of your body. The procedure starts once that medicine starts to work. Your surgeon uses a special tool called a cystoscope -- a long, thin, flexible tube that has a cutting tool, a light, and a camera at the end of it. He'll pass it up through your urethra into your bladder. The camera shows the surgeon the inside of your bladder. He'll use the cutting tool to take some tissue, then he'll use heat on the areas around the cut to stop the bleeding. The tissue that's taken out during the surgery will be looked at under a microscope in a lab to see if it's cancer. If your surgeon removed a cancerous tumor, she may put a liquid medication into your bladder to kill any cancer cells that are left. After the procedure, you'll have a tube in your bladder called a catheter -- It takes pee out of your body and into a bag. You may need to have it in for a few days before you can go on your own. You can get up and walk when you have a catheter, but as the anesthesia wears off, it may feel uncomfortable. Men sometimes feel pain at the tip of the penis afterward. If you do, be sure to let your doctor or nurse know. A numbing gel can help. Many people go home the same day as the surgery. But if your tumor was large, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight. You may see blood in your pee for up to 3 days after your surgery. Drink lots of fluid to help flush out your bladder -- aim for 8 to 10 glasses per day. This also can help keep an infection away. Don't lift anything heavy for 2 to 3 weeks after your surgery. Short walks are OK, but don't do any intense exercise for 4 to 6 weeks. Talk with your doctor about when you can drive and go back to work."
56,"Anyone can get myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ( ME/ CFS). Experts aren't exactly sure what causes it, but they believe certain people might be at greater risk. If you think you may have it, or are concerned that you could be at risk, check with your doctor. If you're a woman, you're four times more likely to get ME/ CFS than men. The condition is rare in children, but girls are more likely to develop it than boys. The illness most often begins in adults aged 30-50. With teenagers, those between 13 and 15 seem to have it most often. Chronic fatigue syndrome ME/ CFS can run in families. It's possible that some people inherit a risk for it from one of their parents, such as inheriting a defect in how a particular gene is built. Probably more important than how genes are built is whether genes are turned on or off properlyâdifferences in gene activity. In people with ME/ CFS, within white blood cells and other parts of the body, there are differences in gene activity. For example, several studies have found that genes important in activating the immune system are more likely to be turned on in people with ME/ CFS. Most diseases are determined both by how genes are built and by things in the environmentâinfectious organisms, toxins, diet, stress, exercise patterns, etc. This may well be true in ME/ CFS, as well. People with chronic fatigue syndrome might be more likely to also have some of the following conditions: Fibromyalgia Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS) Multiple chemical sensitivities Temporomandibular disorders ( TMD or TMJ) Interstitial cystitis, which causes pain in the bladder or pelvis Post-concussion syndrome Tension headache Chronic pelvic pain in women Chronic prostatitis in men It's possible that having one of these conditions could raise your risk for ME/ CFS. Or it could be the other way around. So far, researchers don't completely understand the relationship between chronic fatigue and these other health problems."
57,"Your weight might change when you get treated for breast cancer. Most women gain pounds, but others lose some. Here are common reasons why, along with nutrition and exercise tips. Many things can play a role. Chemotherapy can bring on premature menopause. And with it comes a slowing of the metabolism. That makes it harder to keep weight off. Menopause also causes you to gain more body fat and lose lean muscle. It's common for women who have chemotherapy to gain about 5 to 14 pounds over a year. Some gain less, while others put on as many as 25 pounds. Another reason for weight gain is the use of corticosteroids. These medications help with nausea and swelling, or to stop reactions to chemotherapy. These drugs can boost your appetite. Corticosteroids are hormones that can also cause an increase in fatty tissue. They can make you lose muscle mass in your arms and legs, and gain belly fat, too. You may also have a fullness of the neck or face. Loss of muscle makes weight gain more apparent. Women treated with steroids may also put on pounds, but the weight gain is usually seen only after weeks of continuous use. Some research suggests that weight gain is also related to lack of exercise . When you get your cancer treatment, it's common to feel stress and have some fatigue, nausea, or pain. That can lead to a drop in how much physical activity you get. Weight gain may also be related to intense food cravings. Some women crave sweets and carbohydrates during chemotherapy. Too much of these foods can lead to added pounds. Hormone therapy is another treatment that can cause it. This treatment lowers the amount of estrogen and progesterone in women and the amount testosterone in men. It tends to cause an increase in body fat, too. At the same time, there's a decrease in muscle mass and a change in the way your body converts food into energy. Many women taking tamoxifen have felt the drug was responsible for their weight gain. So far, though, no conclusive studies have shown a relationship between this hormone and the gains. Weight gain is not typical in women who've undergone surgery alone, or women who've had surgery followed by radiation alone. It's typically due to a poor appetite or nausea, which can be a side effect of chemotherapy. Weight gain can raise your risk for getting high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. Being overweight also puts you at risk for getting other types of cancers. Research has also shown that carrying around extra pounds can raise your risk of breast cancer recurring. Weight loss can cause you to lose energy, and poor nutrition can make it harder for you to recover. Stick to a well-balanced diet that includes fruit, vegetables, dairy products, breads, poultry, fish, and lean meat. A diet low in total and saturated fat helps lower your risk of heart disease, and also lowers the risk that your breast cancer will return. It's important to get enough protein. This helps build and repair skin, hair, and muscles during your treatment. It may improve your ability to exercise, too. Good nutrition can help you with the side effects of chemotherapy, and help fight off infections. It lets your body rebuild healthy tissues more quickly. Also, drink plenty of fluids to stay well hydrated, and to protect your bladder and kidneys while on chemotherapy. It's really good for your overall health -- but talk to your doctor before you begin any exercise program. Physical activity can often help reduce the side effects of nausea and fatigue. It can also lift your energy levels. One study found that exercise after chemotherapy might boost infection-fighting T cells, too. Even a moderate amount of exercise may help you live longer. Strength training can help rebuild body mass and increase your strength. You need to take care when working with weights on the upper body, though. That's because lymphedema -- arm swelling -- is a common concern after breast cancer treatment."
58,"Your baby can't tell you when he's having trouble pooping. So it's easy for parents to misunderstand constipation and how it affects their little ones. But a few basic facts about your baby's digestion can help you keep things in perspective. Because breast milk is so nutritious, sometimes a baby's body absorbs almost all of it, leaving little to move through the digestive tract. Your baby may poop only once in a while -- it's perfectly normal for breastfed infants to have a bowel movement once a week. Other infants just have a slower (but completely normal) gut, so they don't go very often. But if your baby seems to be in pain or you have any concerns, call your doctor. In rare cases, a medical problem causes lasting, severe constipation. For example, the muscles in the intestine don't work or there is a blockage in the digestive tract. Otherwise, hard stools are common from time to time. Constipation isn't just about how often your baby poops. It's also about how tough it is for him to do it. If he has soft, easy-to-pass stools every 4-5 days, he's probably OK. On the other hand, you should talk to your doctor if he: Has a hard time going or seems uncomfortable Has hard stools Has poops that are bloody or black Doesn't poop at least once every 5 to 10 days If you're bottle feeding, try a different brand of formula -- after you check with your doctor. Constipation should never be a reason to stop breastfeeding. Add a little dark fruit juice, like prune or pear, to your baby's bottle. Or just give her some extra water if she's older than 4 months -- no more than 1-2 ounces per day. But check with the doctor first. Remember that most babies who don't poop a lot are not truly ""constipated"" and don't need anything different from normal."
59,"Urea cycle disorders ( UCDs) are a group of diseases. They make it hard for your child's body to remove waste products as he digests proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications. When your baby eats protein, his body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what he needs. What he doesn't need is further broken down into waste products that his body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby's liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves his body in his urine. If your child has a urea cycle disorder, his liver can't make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When his body can't remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in his blood. It's toxic and can cause brain damage or put him in a coma. It can even be fatal if you don't treat it quickly. UCDs affect about 1 in 30,000-35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They're named after what's missing from the urea cycle. You'll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons. UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You'll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can't feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as he needs. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U. S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They'll ask about your family history and do tests. They'll look for ammonia in your child's blood and amino acid in his blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of his liver through a process called biopsy. They'll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. UCDs are life-threatening. Don't wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from his blood Feeding him supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout his life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on his body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause his levels to rise. During those times, you'll need to give him extra calories so his body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. There's no cure for UCDs. Your child's long-term health depends on which UCD he has, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan. If your child doesn't follow the special diet or he has frequent stress-induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage. If he's diagnosed early and follows his diet, he can live a normal life."
60,"Medications can control seizures in most people with epilepsy, but they don't work for everyone. About 30% of people taking the drugs can't tolerate the side effects. In some cases, brain surgery may be an option. An operation on the brain can control seizures and improve your quality of life. Surgery has three main goals: Remove the area of the brain that causes seizures. Disrupt the nerve pathways that seizure impulses take through your brain. Implant a device to treat epilepsy. Surgery is only an option if: Your doctor can clearly identify the area of the brain where the seizures start, called the seizure focus. The area to be removed doesn't control a critical function like language, sensation, or movement. If you meet those standards, it works best when: Your seizures are disabling. Medication doesn't control your seizures. Drug side effects are severe and affect your quality of life. People with other serious medical problems, like cancer or heart disease, usually aren't considered for this treatment. The type of surgery you get depends on the type of seizures you have and where in your brain they start. Lobe resection. The largest part of your brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four sections called lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is within your temporal lobe, is the most common type in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in this area is cut away to remove the seizure focus. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy. This surgery removes brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect like a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that cause seizures. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. Corpus callosotomy. The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (called hemispheres) of your brain. In this operation, which is sometimes called split-brain surgery, your doctor cuts the corpus callosum. This stops communication between the hemispheres and prevents the spread of seizures from one side of your brain to the other. It works best for people with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy. In a hemispherectomy, the doctor removes an entire hemisphere -- or half of your brain. In a functional hemispherectomy, the doctor leaves the hemisphere in place but disconnects it from the rest of your brain. He only removes a limited area of brain tissue. This surgery is mostly for children younger than 13 who have one hemisphere that doesn't work the way it should. Multiple subpial transection ( MST). This procedure can help control seizures that begin in areas of your brain that can't be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (he'll call them transections) in your brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the flow of seizure impulses but don't disturb normal brain activity. That leaves your abilities intact. Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS). A device put under your skin sends an electronic jolt to the vagus nerve, which controls activity between your brain and major internal organs. It lowers seizure activity in some people with partial seizures. Responsive neurostimulation device ( RNS). Doctors put a small neurostimulator in your skull, just under your scalp. They link it to one or two wires (called electrodes) that they place either in the part of your brain where the seizures start or on your brain's surface. The device detects abnormal electrical activity in the area and sends an electric current. It can stop the process that leads to a seizure. Deep brain stimulation. Doctors put electrodes into a specific area of the brain. They directly stimulate the brain to help stop the spread of seizures in adults who have not responded to medication and aren't candidates for other surgeries. It depends on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. Others still have seizures, but less often. You'll need to keep taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more afterward. Once your doctor knows your seizures are under control, you may be able to cut back on meds or stop taking them. Before you have surgery, your doctor will discuss the pros and cons with you. Some risks are: Infection and bleeding, as well as the chance of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. These are common with any operation. Making existing problems worse or creating new trouble with the way your brain works. You could lose vision, speech, memory, or movement. A return of seizures. If you have a seizure right after surgery, your doctor may suggest a second surgery (called a reoperation). This doesn't mean the operation didn't work. It usually means your surgeon didn't remove all the brain tissue that causes seizures."
61,"When bugs bug you, you can swat, spray, or move away from them to save your skin. But your baby needs your help to keep stings and bites at bay. What works? What's safe for infants? The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) is clear: Bug repellents -- even the DEET-free ones -- are not safe for newborns. Since you can't use lotions and sprays on the very small, the best way to keep your baby from becoming a bug buffet is by avoiding bugs in the first place. Stay in. Bugs, especially mosquitoes, are most active at dawn and dusk. Keep your baby indoors during those hours to lower his bite risk. Defend your house. Make sure your windows and doors have screens to keep bugs from flying or crawling inside. Cover with clothes. Dress your baby so bugs don't have any access to skin. Loose-fitting long sleeves and pants Socks A hat Skip the bright, flowery prints. Bugs are attracted to those. Protect with a net. Use a fitted mesh net over carriers and strollers when you take your baby outdoors. Drain standing water. Look around your house for soggy sites, like: Planters Birdbaths Wading pools Drill holes in tire swings to keep water from collecting. Change your pets' water bowls regularly. Skip the scents. Many bugs love the smell of perfumes, hairsprays, and scented soaps. Use fragrance-free products on your baby (and yourself when you're with your baby) so you're less attractive to insects. Avoid bug hangouts. Flower gardens, garbage cans, piles of dead leaves, and bushes are all popular places for bug parties, so steer clear. As for bug zappers, don't bother. They don't work and may even invite more insects over. Once your baby is a little older, you can add repellent sprays and lotions to your bug-fighting kit. According to the CDC, insect repellent is the best way to protect your baby from mosquito bites -- as long as you use it correctly. Repellents also protect from other biting bugs like ticks, fleas, chiggers, and biting flies. But they don't work for stinging bugs, like wasps, bees, and hornets. Research says repellents with these active ingredients work the longest: DEET I5353 Picaridin When you use DEET, choose products with less than 30%. And the less time your baby will be outside, the lower the concentration of DEET you should use. Neither the natural repellent oil of lemon eucalyptus ( OLE) nor its lab-made version called PMD is safe for kids under 3 years old. Other repellents made with plant essential oils, such as citronella, cedar, and soybean, can sometimes work. They aren't as long-lasting, though, and they can irritate your baby's skin. Whether you choose sprays, liquids, creams, or sticks to use on your baby: Always read the directions on the package. Apply it to your hands first, then rub it on your baby's skin. Use just enough to protect skin not covered by clothes. Don't put it on your baby's hands or near his mouth and eyes. Skip skin that's cut, scraped, or has a rash. Wash your hands when you're done. If you want to put sunscreen on your baby, too, do that first. Don't use a bug repellent and sunscreen combo. You'll have to reapply it more often than repellent alone."
62,"If you're a smoker or have other risks for lung cancer, you may want to get a screening test that can help your doctor find the disease before you notice any symptoms. The heads up would let you start treatment early, when the condition is easier to fight. If your screening shows you may have lung cancer, your doctor will likely order up ""diagnostic"" tests. Those can pinpoint the type of the disease and whether it's spread to other places in the body. Experts have different views. Several health organizations, including the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, say you should do it if you're at least 55 and you are or were a long-term smoker. Besides smoking, there are other reasons you could have higher odds of lung cancer. Your doctor may suggest you get screened if you: Spent a lot of time around chemicals such as radon, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, silica, or asbestos Already had small-cell lung cancer, or cancer of the head or neck Had radiation therapy to the chest to treat cancer Had a parent, brother or sister, or child with lung cancer Have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs) If you decide to get a screening test, you'll likely get something called low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT). It's a machine that uses X-rays to make detailed pictures of your lungs. It's a super-easy exam to take. You don't need any special prep, like fasting. You just need to hold your breath for about 6 seconds while a technician takes a scan. The whole thing takes about 10 minutes. One thing to keep in mind: Sometimes an LCDT can give a result that looks like cancer, but really isn't. Doctors call this situation a false-positive. You may need to take some other tests to double-check. To find out if a screening test is right for you, take this quiz from the American Lung Association. If your doctor thinks you might have cancer because of your symptoms or your screening test, you may need to take some of these exams: Sputum Cytology. This test looks for cancer cells in your mucus. To get a sample, you'll breathe deeply and then cough with enough force to bring some up from your lungs. Then you'll spit it out into a cup. Imaging Tests. They look for growths that might be lung cancer. Your doctor will be able to figure out if the disease has spread, and if so, where in your body it is. Some imaging tests that may be useful to make a diagnosis are: Chest X-ray. It uses radiation in low doses to make images of your lungs. CT (computed tomography). This powerful X-ray can show the size and shape of cancer, and where it is. You may get a scan of your chest and belly. If you have the disease, the doctor can see whether it has spread to places like your liver or adrenal glands. PET (positron emission tomography). It uses a special type of radiation that collects in cancer cells. A camera then takes pictures of these areas. Your doctor can use this exam to find out if a growth that showed up on an X-ray is really cancer, and to see if it's moved to other places. In this test, your doctor removes some cells from your lungs to check under a microscope for cancer, and to figure out which kind it is. There are a few different ways it's done: Needle biopsy or needle aspiration. Your doctor numbs your skin and uses a needle to remove a sample of tissue. You may hear him talk about two different types. If he uses a thin needle it's called fine needle aspiration. A procedure that uses a slightly thicker, hollow needle to remove a piece of tissue along with the cells is called a core biopsy. Your doctor may use a CT scan or X-ray to guide the needle to the right spot. Bronchoscopy . For this test, he removes a tissue sample through a thin tube that he places into your lungs. Thoracentesis. Your doctor puts a needle into the space between your lung and chest wall to remove fluid, which he checks for cancer cells. Endoscopic ultrasound. When you get this test, he inserts a needle through a lighted tube called an endoscope. Open biopsy. You need to be in a hospital operating room to get this done. A surgeon removes tissue through a cut in your chest. You'll get anesthesia that puts you to sleep while this is going on. However your biopsy is done, after it's over the cells that were removed are sent to a lab. A specialist called a pathologist looks at them under a microscope to check if any of them are cancer. If you get a diagnosis of lung cancer, your doctor will discuss a treatment plan. But make sure you also get the emotional backing you need. Reach out to your family and friends. They can be a huge source of support while you manage and treat your condition. Also look into support groups, where you can talk to people who are going through the same things you are."
63,"Alkaline phosphatase is one kind enzyme found in your body. Enzymes are proteins that help chemical reactions happen. For instance, they can break big molecules down into smaller parts, or they can help smaller molecules join together to form bigger structures. You have alkaline phosphatase throughout your body, including your liver, digestive system, kidneys, and bones. If you show signs of liver disease or a bone disorder, your doctor may order an alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) test to measure the amount of the enzyme in your blood and help in diagnosing the problem. Sometimes it's part of a broader group of tests called a routine liver or hepatic panel, which checks how your liver is working. If your liver isn't working right, the amount of ALP in your blood may be high. Doctors often use the test to look for blocked bile ducts. Other conditions that can cause problems with your liver include: Liver cancer Cirrhosis Hepatitis Blockage in the bile ducts The test can also spot problems with your bones, including: Cancers that have spread to your bones Paget's disease, which affects how bones grow Issues caused by vitamin D deficiency The lab will need a small amount of blood to perform the test. The person in charge of taking your blood will start by placing a tight elastic band, called a tourniquet, around your upper arm. This makes your veins swell with blood. The lab tech will clean an area of your skin with a germ-killing solution. ( It might be a spot inside your elbow or the back of your hand). You'll feel a small stick when the needle goes into your vein. The blood flows into a small vial attached to the needle. When the test is done, the lab tech will take the tourniquet off, and you'll get a bandage on the spot where the needle went in. It takes only a few minutes. Taking blood samples is usually very safe. Some things that might happen after the test include a bruise at the spot where the needle went in, and a little dizziness. There's also a slight chance of infection. You may have to limit food and liquids for several hours before the test. Some medicines interfere with the results, so make sure your doctor knows about all drugs you take, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and supplements. Be sure to let your doctor know if you are pregnant, because that will increase the level of ALP in your blood. It generally takes 1-2 days for results to come back from the lab. Higher-than-normal ALP levels for your age and sex may not necessarily mean you have a problem. ( Children and teens naturally have higher levels than adults because their bones are still developing). If your ALP level is high, your doctor may have you take another test, called an ALP isoenzyme test, to determine whether the alkaline phosphatase in your blood is coming from your liver or your bones."
64,"Kissing bugs are blood-feeding insects that live in the southern and western United States, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. They don't kiss. But they might bite you, probably while you sleep. Most bites are harmless. Sometimes, though, they can cause allergic reactions or spread disease. Very rarely, they can lead to heart disease or sudden deaths. If they live where you do, here's what you need to know. The bugs have brown or black wings, sometimes with a ring of red, orange, or yellow stripes on the edge. They're usually ½- to 1-inch-long, about the size of a penny. They're also called cone-nosed bugs, bloodsuckers, cinches, and triatomine bugs. Like mosquitoes and ticks, kissing bugs need blood to live. They usually suck it from animals, including dogs, but sometimes they bite people. They hide during the day and come out at night to eat. Most of the time, the bites don't hurt. You may sleep right through them. The bugs might hit anywhere on the body, including the face, head, arms, and feet. Kissing bugs are so named because they like to bite around the mouth or eyes. You'll often see 2-15 bite marks in one area and maybe redness and swelling. It might be hard to tell them apart from other bug bites, minor skin irritations, or infections. If you draw a line on a map from California to Pennsylvania, kissing bugs are mostly found south of it. In the U. S., the bugs rarely live indoors. They're more likely to be: Under porches In piles of leaves or wood In outdoor dog houses or chicken coops In nests and burrows of wild animals like rodents and opossums Most of the time, kissing bug bites are harmless. But they sometimes can cause two kinds of problems: Allergic Reactions. Some people are allergic to kissing bug saliva. The skin near the bite might become red, swollen, and itchy. The most serious risk is anaphylactic shock. That's when your blood pressure drops and you have trouble breathing. It can be deadly if you don't get emergency treatment. Chagas Disease. Kissing bugs sometimes have a parasite in their poop that causes Chagas disease. In most people, that causes mild or no symptoms. But in some, the infection can lead to serious, long-term heart problems or disease in the intestines. Chagas disease from a kissing bug is very rare in humans in the U. S. But the number of cases is growing in southern parts of the country. You usually don't need to do anything. You can wash the bitten area with soap and water. If it's itchy or uncomfortable you can use: An ice pack Antihistamine or steroid creams Over-the-counter antihistamine pills If you're in an area where Chagas disease is a serious health concern and you get a kissing bug bite, see your doctor if: You feel like you have a flu with a fever, nausea, or tiredness Your eyelids are swollen The bite looks infected (it's red, painful, and swollen) If you suddenly have trouble breathing, feel dizzy, or vomit, you may have a serious allergic reaction. Call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. It can be hard to know where the bite came from, especially if the bug is gone when you wake up. You could check under your nightstand or your mattress. Scoop up any bugs you find into a container with gloved hands and clean the area the bug touched with bleach. Then call your local health department or extension service to see if someone can help you figure out what kind of bug you have. A local college or university could help you, too. Most people in the U. S. don't need to worry about kissing bugs. They don't usually infest houses here, though an occasional bug might get inside. If you've noticed them in your home or live in an area with Chagas disease, you can take steps to keep them away: Seal cracks and gaps in your home to keep bugs out. Put screens in your windows and patch any holes. Keep chicken coops and other animal cages away from your home. Move piles of leaves, firewood, and rocks out of your yard. Turn off outdoor lights near the house at night so they won't attract bugs. Clean your dog or cat indoor beds regularly."
65,"Blood pressure is the measure of the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. The heart pumps blood into blood vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood out to the body and contributes to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, to stroke, kidney disease, and to heart failure.  A blood pressure reading is written like this: 120/80. It's read as ""120 over 80."" The top number is called the systolic, and bottom number is called the diastolic. The ranges are: Normal: Less than 120 over 80 (120/80) Elevated: 120-129/less than 80 Stage 1 high blood pressure: 130-139/80-89 Stage 2 high blood pressure: 140 and above/90 and above Hypertension crisis: higher than 180/higher than 120 -- See a doctor right away If your blood pressure is above the normal range, talk to your doctor about how to lower it. The exact causes of high blood pressure are not known, but several things may play a role, including: Smoking Being overweight or obese Lack of physical activity Too much salt in the diet Too much alcohol consumption (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day) Stress Older age Genetics Family history of high blood pressure Chronic kidney disease Adrenal and thyroid disorders Sleep apnea Essential Hypertension In as many as 95% of high blood pressure cases in the U. S., the underlying cause can't be found. This type of high blood pressure is called ""essential hypertension."" Though essential hypertension remains somewhat mysterious, it has been linked to certain risk factors. High blood pressure tends to run in families and is more likely to affect men than women. Age and race also play a role. In the United States, blacks are twice as likely as whites to have high blood pressure, although the gap begins to narrow around age 44. After age 65, black women have the highest incidence of high blood pressure. Essential hypertension is also greatly influenced by diet and lifestyle. The link between salt and high blood pressure is especially compelling. People living on the northern islands of Japan eat more salt per capita than anyone else in the world and have the highest incidence of essential hypertension. By contrast, people who add no salt to their food show virtually no traces of essential hypertension. Most people with high blood pressure are ""salt sensitive,"" meaning that anything more than the minimal bodily need for salt is too much for them and increases their blood pressure. Other factors that can raise the risk of having essential hypertension include obesity; diabetes; stress; insufficient intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium; lack of physical activity; and chronic alcohol consumption. Secondary Hypertension When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. Among the known causes of secondary hypertension, kidney disease ranks highest. Hypertension can also be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause the adrenal glands (small glands that sit atop the kidneys) to secrete excess amounts of the hormones that elevate blood pressure. Birth control pills -- specifically those containing estrogen -- and pregnancy can boost blood pressure, as can medications that constrict blood vessels. People with family members who have high blood pressure Smokers African- Americans Pregnant women Women who take birth control pills People over the age of 35 People who are overweight or obese People who are not active People who drink alcohol excessively People who eat too many fatty foods or foods with too much salt People who have sleep apnea"
66,"To help your sprained ankle heal, you'll need to ease the pain and bring down the swelling. Make an appointment right away for any ankle sprain, mild or severe. You doctor will examine you and let you know if something more serious is wrong with your ankle. Pain, bruising, or severe swelling Bleeding, numbness, or change in color of the affected area Your ankle looks deformed or seems dislocated You can't put any weight on it If your ankle is just painful and swollen, remove ankle bracelets or toe rings right away. Then try the â RICEâ method to ease your symptoms. RICE stands for ârest, ice, compress, and elevate.â Here's how it works: Rest the ankle (use crutches if needed) Ice the ankle for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 2 days Compress (wrap) the ankle lightly -- not tightly -- with an elastic bandage or ankle brace For the first 48 hours, elevate (raise) the ankle higher than your heart whenever you're lying down Take the compression wrap out of the packaging and unroll it. Place a small section of the cloth just behind your toes and begin to wrap it in a spiral toward your heart. Each layer should cover about half the width of the previous one. Continue wrapping around the foot, heel, and ankle until every bit of skin -- up to several inches above the injury -- is covered. If you still have pain and swelling, ask your doctor about over-the-counter pain relievers. Don't give aspirin to anyone under age 19."
67,"A heart computerized tomography ( CT) scan, also called a calcium-score screening heart scan, is used to find calcium deposits in plaque of people with heart disease. They're the most effective way to spot atherosclerosis before symptoms develop. The more coronary calcium you have, the more coronary atherosclerosis you have. That gives you a higher chance of cardiovascular problems in the future. Some kinds of coronary disease don't show up in a CT scan, so it's important to remember that this test can't completely predict things like a heart attack. In addition to a CT scan, your doctor may order a coronary CT angiogram ( CTA) to get pictures of the arteries of your heart. You can continue to take your medications. But you should avoid caffeine and smoking for 4 hours before the test. CT scanners use X-rays, so this is not recommended if you are pregnant. Tell your technologist and your doctor if you are: Pregnant Having radiation therapy You will change into a hospital gown. The nurse will record your height, weight, and blood pressure. You may have blood taken for a lipid analysis. You'll lie on a special scanning table. The technologist will clean three small areas of your chest and place small, sticky electrode patches there. Men may expect to have their chest partially shaved to help the electrodes stick. They are attached to an electrocardiograph ( EKG) monitor, which charts your heart's electrical activity. You may also get a shot of contrast material. This will help your coronary arteries to show up. During the scan, you'll feel the table move inside a doughnut-shaped scanner. The high-speed CT scan gets many images, in sync with your heartbeat. A computer program, guided by the cardiovascular radiologist, analyzes the images to look for calcification in your coronary arteries. If there isn't any, it's considered a negative exam. But there could still be soft, noncalcified plaque. If there is calcium, the computer will create a score that estimates how much coronary artery disease you have. The whole thing takes only a few minutes. You can do what you normally do and eat what you usually do after the scan. The results will be reviewed. Your doctor will then know: The number of calcified coronary plaques in the coronary arteries and how dense they are Your calcium score A team of cardiovascular specialists will review your heart CT scan results. They will evaluate the calcium score and your CT angiogram, along with things like your blood pressure and lipid analysis. They'll then recommend any changes in your lifestyle and medications, plus other cardiac testing you should get. You and your primary care doctor will get the full report outlining your risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. Because this CT scan is a screening exam for heart disease, it is not covered under most insurance companies. Medicare does pay for some CT angiograms."

69,"Lots of people are intimately familiar with acid reflux symptoms. More than 60 million Americans experience acid reflux at least once a month. Acid reflux disease, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD), can produce a variety of symptoms. Heartburn, regurgitation, and dyspepsia are a few of the most common acid reflux symptoms.  Heartburn. Also called acid indigestion, heartburn is a burning pain or discomfort that can move up from your stomach to the middle of your abdomen and chest. The pain can also move into your throat. Despite its name, heartburn doesn't affect your heart. Regurgitation. Another common symptom of acid reflux is regurgitation -- or the sensation of acid backing up into your throat or mouth. Regurgitation can produce a sour or bitter taste, and you may experience ""wet burps."" Dyspepsia. Many people with acid reflux disease also have a syndrome called dyspepsia. Dyspepsia is a general term for stomach discomfort. Symptoms of dyspepsia include: Burping Nausea after eating Stomach fullness or bloating Upper abdominal pain and discomfort Symptoms of acid reflux may be a sign that stomach acid has inflamed your esophagus. When that happens, stomach acid can damage the lining of your esophagus and cause bleeding. Over time, it can also change the cells of esphagus and cause cancer ( Barrett's esophagus). Although acid reflux is extremely common and rarely serious, don't ignore your acid reflux symptoms. Making a few lifestyle changes and using over-the-counter antacids are often all you need to control acid reflux symptoms. Acid reflux symptoms most often occur: After eating a heavy meal When bending over or lifting an object When lying down, especially on your back People who have frequent acid reflux symptoms most often experience them at night. Nighttime GERD also produces the most pain. However, the level of pain does not always indicate the degree of damage to your esophagus. More than half of all pregnant women experience heartburn during pregnancy. Increased hormones and pressure from a growing fetus can combine to produce this acid reflux symptom. In most cases, heartburn improves or completely goes away after delivery. Certain foods can make the symptoms of acid reflux worse for some people. To lessen your symptoms, try avoiding: Citrus fruits Chocolate Caffeinated drinks or alcohol Spicy, fatty, or fried foods Garlic and onions Peppermint Tomatoes Usually, acid reflux symptoms cause no complications. In a few cases, continued esophageal damage can lead to scarring, which may cause the esophagus to narrow. The narrowing creates strictures and makes it difficult to swallow. You may have dysphagia, a sensation that food is stuck in your esophagus. In some cases, normal cells in the lining of the esophagus may be replaced by a different type of cell. This is called Barrett's esophagus, which can sometimes develop into cancer. Be sure to call your doctor if you don't get lasting relief from medications. Also call the doctor right away if you have any ""alarm"" acid reflux symptoms, such as these: Unexpected weight loss Blood in vomit Black, tarry, or maroon-colored stools Difficulty or pain with swallowing Other acid reflux symptoms that should prompt a call to your doctor include: Asthma-like symptoms, such as wheezing or dry cough Hoarseness, especially in the morning Chronic sore throat Hiccups that don't let up Nausea that lasts for more than a day or two Sometimes, people confuse the symptoms of heart attack with symptoms of acid reflux disease. That's because pain in the chest can feel like heartburn. When in doubt, call your doctor. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms of heart attack: Chest pain, pressure, or fullness lasting more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back Pain or discomfort in your neck, shoulder, upper back, or jaw Shortness of breath, with or without chest pain Dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea Sweating along with chest pain"
70,"Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of your spinal cord. It results from damage to nerve cells in a certain area. A fatty tissue called myelin protects these nerve fibers. It fits around them like the insulation that covers an electrical wire. When myelin is damaged, the nerves underneath can be hurt, too. Once your nerves are scarred, it's harder for them to send signals to other parts of your body the way they should. This often brings pain, weakness, or paralysis. When this happens to the nerves on both sides of part of your spinal cord, it's known as transverse myelitis. More than half the time, doctors aren't sure what causes it. But they know it can happen when your body tries to fight off a disease. Or when your immune system attacks healthy cells for some reason. It's often linked to: Autoimmune conditions like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome that cause inflammation. Infections: Bacterial infections like Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis Fungal infections of the spinal cord, like aspergillus, blastomyces, coccidioides, and cryptococcus Parasites such as toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, and angtiostrongyloid Viral Infections like varicella zoster, which causes chickenpox and shingles; enterovirus; and West Nile virus Multiple sclerosis ( MS): Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of MS, which destroys myelin in your brain and spinal cord. It can also signal a relapse. If it's early MS, you'll probably have symptoms on one side of your body only. Neuromyelitis optica : This disease causes inflammation and myelin loss to nerves in your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, which sends information to your brain. If you have this type, symptoms will show up on both sides of your body. Vascular disorders: Like arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistula, intra spinal cavernous malformations, or disk embolism. Symptoms may show up in a few hours or days (your doctor will call this an acute attack). Or you might notice them gradually over a few weeks (this is called subacute). While the condition isn't chronic, it can come back if you have a history of autoimmune disease. The first symptoms are usually: Pain in your lower back Sharp pain that moves down your legs and arms or around your chest and belly Weakness or paralysis in your legs or arms Sensitivity to touch, to the point where slight fingertip pressure causes pain Numbness or a pins-and-needles feeling in your toes, feet, or legs Muscle spasms Fever Loss of appetite Bladder and bowel control issues Once they start, symptoms can get worse within hours. Most of the time, they peak within 10 days. At that point, about half the people who get transverse myelitis lose control of their legs. Most have some numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in their back, belly, arms, or legs. Almost all lose some bladder control. How much of your body is affected depends on which part of your spinal cord has the problem. The higher it is, the more problems you'll have. Your doctor will run tests to figure out if you have transverse myelitis or some other condition. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) or computerized tomography ( CT) scan: These tests created detailed images of your insides. They'll show the doctor if something else is affecting your nerves, like a tumor, a slipped disk, or narrowing of the channel that holds your spinal cord. Spinal tap: For this test, your doctor puts a needle in between two vertebrae (bones in your back) to take a sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. If it has more disease-fighting white blood cells or certain proteins than it should, you might have an infection. Bloodwork: Your doctor will test your blood for signs of illnesses with similar symptoms, like lupus, HIV, or another form of myelitis. He'll try to find out if transverse myelitis is a sign of a related illness, like MS. There's no cure, so your doctor will try to manage the disease and ease your symptoms. She may suggest: Antiviral medications: You'll take them if your doctor thinks a virus is causing your illness. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG): The doctor will inject antibodies from healthy donors into your system. They'll bind to your problem-causing antibodies and take them out of circulation. Medication for symptoms and complications: You might get drugs to relieve muscle spasms, help control your bladder or bowels, ease stiffness, manage depression, and help with sexual problems. Over-the-counter pain medicines: Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen can all help. Plasma exchange therapy: If steroids don't lower your inflammation, this treatment, also called plasmapheresis, might. The doctor will replace your blood plasma (the liquid part that holds the blood cells). This might get rid of something in it that's causing your immune system to attack your body and keep it from damaging other organs. Prescription pain medications: Drugs that treat depression can help ease nerve pain, too. You might get drugs for depression or drugs that stop seizures. Respirator: If your symptoms affect your breathing, this machine can help you breathe. It'll make sure your body gets enough oxygen. Steroids: They'll ease inflammation in your spine. You might get pills or have it put directly into your veins. Your doctor might also suggest: Rest: You might need to stay in bed while you fight the illness. Physical therapy: You'll learn: Ways to keep your muscles strong and your limbs flexible while you recover Techniques to control your bowels and bladder How to use tools that make life easier, like wheelchairs, canes, or braces Occupational therapy: This will teach you new ways to do daily chores, like cooking dinner, taking a bath, getting dressed, or cleaning the house. Psychotherapy: This will help you manage the mental effects of anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, and other emotional or behavioral issues. Vocational therapy: It can help you find a job that suits your abilities or work with your employer to make changes you need. Sometimes. The most common are: Pain: It's both a symptom and a lasting complication. Spasticity: This includes stiff, tight, and spasming muscles. It's most common in your legs and bottom. Sexual problems: Men may have trouble getting an erection. Both genders could have trouble reaching orgasm. Depression or anxiety: Between the changes this disease makes to your body, the stress of living with it, the pain, and the sexual troubles, there's a lot to handle. About 1,400 people a year get transverse myelitis, and about 33,000 people have some sort of disability as a result. About a third of people with transverse myelitis get better and don't have much permanent damage. They can walk normally and have only small lingering issues. Another third have problems walking. They also may have muscle spasms, a less sensitive sense of touch, or trouble controlling their bladder. Continue Reading Below The remaining third are no longer able to walk and need help with many everyday activities. Doctors don't know why transverse myelitis affects some people more than others. They do think that the faster your symptoms show up, the harder it may be for you to recover. Early treatment and physical therapy can help."
71,"High-output heart failure is rare. It's also very different from other types of the disorder. Usually, if you have heart failure, your heart isn't pumping enough blood through your body to help it work the way it should. With the high-output version, it's pumping a normal amount of blood -- or even more than normal. Still, your body isn't getting enough to help it work well. The things that lead to high-output heart failure are different from what brings other types of the condition. Many disorders make you need more blood to keep your organs working well. They include: Obesity Liver disease Anemia Hyperthyroidism Pregnancy Lung disease Septic shock Paget's disease Arteriovenous fistula Beriberi heart disease Common signs of high-output heart failure are similar to those of other types. They can include: Shortness of breath Tiredness or weakness Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, or abdomen Lasting cough or wheezing Fast or irregular heartbeat Dizziness Confusion Having to go to the bathroom more often at night Nausea Lack of appetite To figure out if you have heart failure, your doctor will: Examine you Ask about your medical history Run some tests Those tests might include: Blood tests: Abnormal levels of important substances can show strain to organs due to heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( EKG): This records the electrical activity of your heart. Chest X-ray: It will let your doctor know if you have an enlarged heart. It can also show congestion. Echocardiogram: This uses sound waves to make a video image of your heart. Exercise test: You may hear this called a stress test. It measures how your heart responds when it has to work hard. Heart catheterization: In this test, you get dye injected through a small tube into a blood vessel. It will show any blockages or weakened arteries. Many of the causes of high-output heart failure are curable. It's a good idea to treat the underlying cause first. Your doctor may suggest other treatments, including a diet low in salt and water. You may also take diuretics (water pills) to help ease swelling. Taking traditional heart failure drugs will often not help. They can make things worse. There are medicines called vasoconstrictor adrenergics that can help by making your blood vessels smaller."
72,"When you're a teenager, it's not unusual to have a pimple or two. But if you have large, red, and painful breakouts deep in your skin, it could mean you've developed something called cystic acne. These breakouts can be treated. Don't try to wait them out. Cystic acne can linger for years. It can affect large areas of your skin and leave permanent scars. A dermatologist can help you with a treatment plan. You get a pimple when a pore in your skin gets clogged, usually with dead skin cells. Sometimes bacteria get trapped inside the pore, too, causing the area to become red and swollen.  Cystic acne happens when this infection goes deep into your skin, creating a red, tender bump that's full of pus. It may hurt or itch. If a cyst bursts, the infection can spread, causing more breakouts. You're most likely to develop cystic acne in your teens or early 20s. But it can strike someone as young as 8 or as old as 50. Your face, chest, back, upper arms, or shoulders can be affected. Severe cystic acne is more common in men, but women get it, too. Women often have cysts on the lower half of the face. No one is sure of the exact cause, but hormones called androgens play a part. When you're a teenager, androgens increase. This leads to changes in your skin that can result in clogged pores and acne. In women, hormone changes can be brought on by menstrual cycles, pregnancy, menopause, or a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome. If one of your parents had severe cystic acne, you have a greater chance of getting it. Over-the-counter medicines that work on milder acne often have little effect on cystic acne. A dermatologist will likely recommend one or more of the following: Oral antibiotics help control bacteria and lower inflammation. Sometimes your acne may not respond to antibiotics, though. Or you may find they don't work as well after a few years. Birth-control pills help some women by regulating their hormones. Prescription-strength creams, lotions, or gels with retinoid, a form of vitamin A, can help unplug your pores and help antibiotics do their job. Isotretinoin (formally known as Accutane but now available as the brands Claravis, Sotret, Myorisan, Amnesteem, and Absorica) attacks all causes of acne. The recommended dosage for most of these medications is to take a pill once or twice daily for about 5 months. For most people, this clears the skin completely and permanently. If it recurs, you can repeat the treatment. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this drug. Spironolactone is a medication that helps you get rid of unneeded water, but also is effective for cystic acne in women. Injections of steroids into individual cysts can be performed at your doctor's office. See More: Birth Control for Acne Don't touch cysts or pick at these blemishes. You may push the infection deeper and make it spread. Try to relax. Stress can cause your body to release more hormones, which can make acne worse. Follow a healthy lifestyle. Get plenty of sleep and exercise. Some research suggests that a low-glycemic diet, which limits sugar, can help symptoms."
73," People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and think they have a food allergy. But they may be having something else: a reaction called food intolerance. What's the difference? A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. With a food intolerance, your immune system isn't responsible. Most of the time it's a problem with digesting the food. For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly because of lactose intolerance. Some people come from families where allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies, but perhaps hay fever, asthma, or hives. When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies. If you think you have a food allergy, see a doctor to confirm what's triggering it and get help managing and treating it. Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E ( Ig E), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood. The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of Ig E for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The Ig E gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. You won't have a reaction yet, but now you're set up for one. The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that Ig E and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body. The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure. As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema. In the lungs, they may cause wheezing. All of this takes place within a few minutes to an hour. In adults, they include: Peanuts Tree nuts, such as walnuts Shellfish, including shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab For children, the food allergens that most often cause problems are: Eggs Milk Peanuts Adults usually don't lose their allergies, but children do sometimes. Kids are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, and soy than to peanuts, fish, and shrimp. The foods that you'll react to are often those that you eat regularly. In Japan, for example, you'll find rice allergy. In Scandinavia, codfish allergy is common. When you have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a certain food, your doctor will probably recommend that you avoid similar foods, too. For example, if you react to shrimp, you're probably allergic to other shellfish like crab, lobster, and crayfish. This is called cross-reactivity. Another example of cross-reactivity is oral allergy syndrome. It happens in people who are highly sensitive to ragweed. During ragweed season, when they try to eat melons, especially cantaloupe, their mouths may itch. Similarly, people who have severe birch pollen allergy may also react to apple peels. At least one type of food allergy needs more than simply eating the allergen to cause a reaction. If you have exercise-induced food allergy, you won't have a reaction unless you then do something physically active. As your body temperature goes up, you'll begin to itch, get lightheaded, and could have hives or even anaphylaxis. Fortunately, the cure is simple: Don't eat that food for a couple of hours before you work out. A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. When you go to the doctor's office and say, "" I think I have a food allergy,"" they have to consider a list of other things that could cause similar symptoms and be confused with a food allergy. These include: Food poisoning Histamine toxicity Food additives, including sulfites, MSG, and dyes Lactose intolerance Gluten intolerance Other diseases Psychological triggers Foods can get contaminated with bacteria and toxins. Tainted meat sometimes mimics a food allergy when it's really a type of food poisoning. Histamine can reach high levels in cheese, some wines, and in certain kinds of fish, especially tuna and mackerel, if it hasn't been refrigerated properly. When you eat foods with a lot of histamine, you could have a reaction that looks like an allergic reaction. It's called histamine toxicity. Sulfites are made naturally during the fermentation of wine, and they're added to other foods to enhance crispness or prevent mold growth. High concentrations of sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma. They give off a gas called sulfur dioxide, which the person breathes in while they're eating the food. This irritates their lungs and can trigger an asthma attack. That's why the FDA banned sulfites as spray-on preservatives for fresh fruits and vegetables. But sulfites are still used in some foods. Monosodium glutamate ( MSG) is naturally in foods including tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms. It's added to others to boost flavor. When eaten in large amounts, it can cause flushing, warmth, headache, pressure in your face, chest pain, or feelings of detachment. Yellow dye number 5 can cause hives, although that's rare. Lactose intolerance, the most common food intolerance, affects at least 1 out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the gut. It breaks down lactose, a type of sugar in milk and other dairy products. If you don't have enough lactase, you can't digest lactose. Instead, bacteria eat the lactose, which creates gas, and you can get bloating, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Your doctor can measure your body's response to lactose by testing blood samples. Gluten intolerance is related to celiac disease. It's caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat and some other grains. Several other diseases share symptoms with food allergies, including ulcers and digestive system cancers. These can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping pain that gets worse when you eat. Some people may have a food intolerance with a psychological trigger. An unpleasant event, often during childhood, that's tied to eating a particular food can bring on a rush of unpleasant sensations when you eat that food later, even as an adult. First, the doctor asks detailed questions like: Did the reaction come on quickly, within an hour of eating the food? Did anyone else get sick? How much did you eat before the reaction started? How was the food prepared? Did you eat anything else at the same time? Did you take an antihistamine or do something else? Did it help? Does this always happen when you eat that food? These help the doctor understand what's going on and could point to another explanation. For example, if you ate fish contaminated with histamine, everyone who ate that same fish would have gotten sick, too. Some people will have a violent allergic reaction only to raw or undercooked fish because heat destroys the allergens they're sensitive to. Or other foods in the meal can delay digestion so the allergic reaction starts later. Your doctor may ask you to keep a food diary, a record of each meal and any reaction you have. This gives more detail for you both to look for patterns. You may find that the severity of your reaction is related to the amount of food that you ate. The next step might be an elimination diet, which you do with the help of your doctor. You start by not eating a suspect food, like eggs. If your symptoms go away, that strongly suggests an allergy. Then you try eating that food again to see if the symptoms come back, which confirms the diagnosis. But you can't do an elimination diet if your reactions are severe (because you wouldn't want to trigger it) or you don't have them often. If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response. One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness. Skin tests are quick, simple, and relatively safe. But experts don't recommend making a diagnosis based on a skin test alone. Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food. If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. It also can't be done if you have severe eczema. Instead, your doctor can use blood tests such as RAST and ELISA that measure the amount of food-specific Ig E. These tests may cost more, and results take longer. Again, a positive result doesn't necessarily mean you have a food allergy. A food challenge, or feeding test, is another way to confirm or rule out an allergy. It's done with your doctor there. You eat small servings of food every 15-30 minutes that have increasing amounts of the suspected allergen in them until you either have a reaction or eat a meal-sized portion. In a ""double-blind"" test, neither you or your doctor know if what you're eating has the allergen in it. This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. The test can provide evidence to look elsewhere to find the real cause of the reaction. Of course, people with severe reactions can't do food challenges, and it's hard to test more than one food allergy at the same time. It's also expensive because it takes a lot of time. Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. These include: Cytotoxicity testing. A food allergen is added to your blood sample. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."" Sublingual or subcutaneous provocative challenge. It's similar to a skin test, but the sample of food allergen goes under your tongue or gets injected under your skin. Immune complex assay. This blood test looks for groups of certain antibodies bound to the food allergen. But these clusters normally form as part of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them. Ig G subclass assay. This blood test looks specifically for certain kinds of Ig G antibody, but they're part of a normal immune response. The main way to deal with food allergies is to avoid them. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to. Once you've identified the food, you have to stop eating it. That may mean reading long, detailed ingredient lists because many allergy-triggering foods are in things you wouldn't expect to find them in. Peanuts, for example, may be included for protein, and eggs are in some salad dressings. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen. Even people who are very careful can make a mistake, so if you have severe food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine ( Adrenaclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room. Parents and caregivers should protect children from their trigger foods and know what to do if the child eats one. Schools should have plans in place to address any related emergency. Medications can help relieve food allergy symptoms that aren't part of an anaphylactic reaction: Antihistamines for digestive issues, hives, and sneezing and a runny nose Bronchodilators for tightened airways or asthma-like symptoms But these won't prevent an allergic reaction if you take them before eating the food. No medication can. Putting a dilute solution of a food under your tongue about a half hour before you eat it as a way to ""neutralize"" your exposure doesn't work either. Allergy pills and shots are being studied as way to desensitize people to food allergens. You regularly get small amounts of food extracts over a long period of time to help your body build up a kind of tolerance. But researchers haven't yet proven that allergy shots work for food allergies. Milk and soy allergies are particularly common in infants and young children, probably because their immune and digestive systems are still developing. These allergies can appear within days to months of birth. They may not show up as hives and asthma, but rather lead to colic and perhaps blood in poop or poor growth. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years. Doctors recommend only breastfeeding infants for the first 4-6 months, if possible, for many reasons, but there's no proof that it prevents food allergies later in life. While some pregnant women may hope limiting their diets while they're pregnant or breastfeeding may help their children avoid allergies, the experts disagree and don't suggest it. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either. Although some people think certain illnesses can be caused by food allergies, evidence doesn't back up such claims. Histamines in cheese or red wine, for example, can trigger migraines. But we can't say that food allergies actually cause migraines. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis aren't made worse by foods. Food allergies don't cause ""allergic tension fatigue syndrome,"" where people get tired, nervous, and may have problems concentrating or headaches. Cerebral allergy is a term that describes when mast cells are supposedly releasing their chemicals in the brain -- and nowhere else in the body -- causing trouble concentrating and headaches. Most doctors don't recognize cerebral allergy as a disorder. Even when their surroundings are very clean, some people have many general complaints like problems concentrating, fatigue, or depression. Environmental illness may be the result of small amounts of allergens or toxins, but not food allergies. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them. A food allergy won't directly affect a child's behavior, although their symptoms might make them cranky and difficult, and allergy medications can make them sleepy."
74,"The specific causes of restless legs syndrome ( RLS) are not known. Disease in the blood vessels of the legs or in the nerves in the legs that control leg movement and sensation was once thought to cause RLS, but both of these suggestions have been rejected. RLS may be related to abnormalities in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that help regulate muscle movements, or to abnormalities in the part of the central nervous system that controls automatic movements. Research is still being done in these areas. RLS can sometimes be caused by an underlying medical condition (secondary RLS); however, most of the time the cause is not clear. Many different medical conditions have been linked to RLS. The two most common conditions are iron-deficiency anemia (low blood count) and peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves of the arms and legs, often caused by underlying conditions such as diabetes). Other medical conditions linked to RLS include: Parkinson's disease Varicose veins Some tumors Fibromyalgia Hyper- or hypothyroidism (over- or underactive thyroid glands) Pregnancy Cigarette smoking Vitamin and mineral deficiency, such as magnesium deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency Severe kidney disease and uremia (kidney failure causing build up of toxins within the body) Amyloidosis (build-up of a starch-like substance in the body's tissues and organs) Lyme disease Damage to spinal nerves Rheumatoid arthritis and SjÃ¶gren syndrome Certain medications or substances, such as: Alcohol Caffeine Anticonvulsant drugs (such as Dilantin) Antidepressant drugs (including amitriptyline, Paxil) Beta-blockers (drugs often used to treat high blood pressure) Antipsychotics Withdrawal from certain drugs, such as vasodilator drugs (for example, Apresoline), sedatives, or antidepressants (for example, Tofranil) In many cases, RLS seems to run in families. People with a genetic link to RLS tend to get the condition earlier in life. Find out how doctors diagnose restless legs syndrome. Learn about restless legs syndrome treatments.

75,"Seek emergency care if: There is loss or change in vision. The pain follows an injury to the eye. If the person wears contact lenses, take them out. Dark glasses may provide comfort. Do not flush, patch, rub, dab at, or place compresses on the eye. See a health care provider for persistent pain, eye redness, change in vision, drainage from the eye, rashes around the eye, swelling of the eyelids, or fever. The health care provider will examine the eye and test vision. Depending on the age of the person, the health care provider may also check the pressure within the eye and perform other tests. Depending on the cause, the health care provider may prescribe eye drops or oral medicines or both and may recommend consultation from an ophthalmologist (eye specialist). Follow up depends on the cause of pain but may require a visit to an ophthalmologist."
76,"Things like autoimmune diseases, surgery, and radiation treatment can all keep your thyroid gland from making the right amount of thyroid hormone. This is the most common reason that Americans have low thyroid levels. It's an autoimmune disease. If you have one, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells. If you have Hashimoto's disease, it destroys the cells that make thyroid hormone. You can get hypothyroidism if you've had a procedure to remove part or all of your thyroid gland. You may have that done if you have a growth on your thyroid, or if it's making too much hormone (which is called hyperthyroidism). If you have the entire gland removed, you will get hypothyroidism. For some people, if only part of it is taken out, the part that's left behind may still be able to make enough thyroid hormone. This can damage cells that make thyroid hormone. You might get treated with radiation for: Overactive thyroid gland Cancer of the head or neck Hodgkin's disease or lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system) A bacterial or viral infection can make your thyroid gland swell. You may hear your doctor call this thyroiditis. The damaged thyroid leaks hormone into your blood. That causes your thyroid hormone level to rise briefly. Once that hormone gets used, your levels will drop back to normal. Low levels from thyroiditis usually don't last long because the gland hasn't been permanently damaged. Women can get thyroiditis after they give birth. That's called postpartum thyroiditis. It's thought to be an autoimmune disease, much like Hashimoto's disease. Some can affect how your thyroid works and lead to low hormone levels. These include: Lithium: Used for bipolar disorder and depression. Interferon alpha: A cancer treatment. Amiodarone ( Cordarone, Pacerone): Given for heart rhythm problems. Interleukin-2: Used for kidney cancer. Your thyroid gland needs iodine to make its hormone. You get it from many of the foods you eat. Not getting enough is rare in the U. S. because it's added to a lot of foods. It happens more in developing countries. Too much iodine can cause or worsen hypothyroidism. Some babies are born with a missing or poorly formed thyroid gland. This is congenital hypothyroidism. Less often, low thyroid level comes from a problem outside the gland. The culprit may be the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, which directs your thyroid to make its hormone. If a tumor, surgery, or radiation damages your pituitary, it may not be able to give instructions to the thyroid. Whatever the cause, medicine can get your hypothyroidism under control. Talk with your doctor about it."
77,"Hypothermia is a potentially dangerous drop in body temperature, usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. The risk of cold exposure increases as the winter months arrive. But if you're exposed to cold temperatures on a spring hike or capsized on a summer sail, you can also be at risk of hypothermia.  Normal body temperature averages 98.6 degrees. With hypothermia, core temperature drops below 95 degrees. In severe hypothermia, core body temperature can drop to 82 degrees or lower. During exposure to cold temperatures, most heat loss -- up to 90% -- escapes through your skin; the rest, you exhale from your lungs. Heat loss through the skin happens primarily through radiation and speeds up when skin is exposed to wind or moisture. If cold exposure is due to being immersed in cold water, heat loss can occur 25 times faster than it would if exposed to the same air temperature. The hypothalamus, the brain's temperature-control center, works to raise body temperature by triggering processes that heat and cool the body. During cold temperature exposure, shivering is a protective response to produce heat through muscle activity. In another heat-preserving response -- called vasoconstriction -- blood vessels temporarily narrow. Normally, the activity of the heart and liver produce most of your body heat. But as core body temperature cools, these organs produce less heat, in essence causing a protective ""shut down"" to preserve heat and protect the brain. Low body temperature can slow brain activity, breathing, and heart rate. Confusion and fatigue can set in, hampering a person's ability to understand what's happening and make intelligent choices to get to safety. Hypothermia symptoms for adults include: Shivering, which may stop as hypothermia progresses (shivering is actually a good sign that a person's heat regulation systems are still active. ) Slow, shallow breathing Confusion and memory loss Drowsiness or exhaustion Slurred or mumbled speech Loss of coordination, fumbling hands, stumbling steps A slow, weak pulse In severe hypothermia, a person may be unconscious without obvious signs of breathing or a pulse Hypothermia symptoms for infants include: Cold-to-touch, bright red skin Unusually low energy Possible causes of hypothermia include: Cold exposure. When the balance between the body's heat production and heat loss tips toward heat loss for a prolonged period, hypothermia can occur. Accidental hypothermia usually happens after cold temperature exposure without enough warm, dry clothing for protection. Mountain climbers on Mount Everest avoid hypothermia by wearing specialized, high-tech gear designed for that windy, icy environment. However, much milder environments can also lead to hypothermia, depending on a person's age, body mass, body fat, overall health, and length of time exposed to cold temperatures. A frail, older adult in a 60-degree house after a power outage can develop mild hypothermia overnight. Infants and babies sleeping in cold bedrooms are also at risk. Other causes. Certain medical conditions such as diabetes and thyroid conditions, some medications, severe trauma, or using drugs or alcohol all increase the risk of hypothermia. People at increased risk for hypothermia include: The elderly, infants, and children without adequate heating, clothing, or food People with mental illness People who are outdoors for extended periods People in cold weather whose judgment is impaired by alcohol or drugs Recognizing the symptoms is the first step in diagnosing hypothermia. A specialized thermometer, available in most hospital emergency rooms, can detect very low core body temperatures and confirm a diagnosis. Temperatures for mild, moderate, and severe hypothermia generally range from: Mild hypothermia: 90-95 degrees Farenheit Moderate hypothermia: 82-90 degrees Farenheit Severe hypothermia: Lower than 82 degrees Farenheit Because response to hypothermia varies among individuals, temperatures may differ. Hypothermia is a potentially life-threatening condition that needs emergency medical attention. If medical care isn't immediately available: Remove any wet clothes, hats, gloves, shoes, and socks. Protect the person against wind, drafts, and further heat loss with warm, dry clothes and blankets. Move gently to a warm, dry shelter as soon as possible. Begin rewarming the person with extra clothing. Use warm blankets. Other helpful items for warming are: an electric blanket to the torso area and hot packs and heating pad on the torso, armpits, neck, and groin; however, these can cause burns to the skin. Use your own body heat if nothing else is available. Take the person's temperature if a thermometer is available. Offer warm liquids, but avoid alcohol and caffeine, which speed up heat loss. Don't try to give fluids to an unconscious person. If the hypothermic person is unconscious, or has no pulse or signs of breathing, call for emergency help right away. CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be given immediately if a pulse can't be felt and there is no sign of breathing. Feel for the pulse for up to a whole minute before starting CPR, because the heart rate may be extremely slow and you should not start CPR if there is any heartbeat present. CPR should be continued, in the absence of signs of breathing or a pulse, until paramedics arrive or the person is taken to a hospital. In cases of advanced hypothermia, hospital treatment is required to rewarm the core temperature. Hypothermia treatment may include warmed IV fluids, heated and humidified oxygen, peritoneal lavage (internal ""washing"" of the abdominal cavity), and other measures. Complications during recovery can include pneumonia, heart arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation (a dangerous ""fluttering"" rhythm of the heart), cardiac arrest (a sudden stopping of the heartbeat), and death. Seek immediate medical help for anyone with hypothermia. Call 911 if you suspect severe hypothermia."
78,"Your kidneys filter waste and extra fluid from your blood, and your body gets rid of them through urine. If your kidneys don't work well, those things can stay in your blood. That condition is called uremia, or uremic syndrome. It can happen because of a long-running health problem, like diabetes or high blood pressure, or because a severe injury or an infection damages your kidneys. As waste and fluid build up in your blood, you might: Feel nauseated Feel itchy Lose your appetite or taste for some foods Feel more tired than usual Lose weight Have trouble concentrating Feel pain, numbness, or cramps in your legs or feet (caused by damage to your nerves) If it's not treated, uremia can also cause other problems, like: High blood pressure Anemia (when you don't have enough red blood cells) Heart disease Brain damage If your doctor thinks you might have uremia, he may recommend that you see a kidney specialist, called a nephrologist. She can do a few tests to see how well your kidneys are working: Blood tests. These measure certain things in your blood, including a chemical called creatinine and a waste product called urea. Based on how much creatinine is there, your doctor can use a formula to figure out your estimated glomerular filtration rate (e GFR). This will show how much blood your kidneys can clean every minute. The lower the number, the more damaged your kidneys are. Urinalysis. Your doctor will take a sample of your pee to look for things like blood cells or proteins that shouldn't be there if your kidneys are working well. This depends on the reason for the problem with your kidneys. If it's caused by a condition like high blood pressure or diabetes, treating that may keep them from getting worse. If your kidneys are damaged to the point that they're failing, you may need help getting waste out of your blood. One option is a process called dialysis. It usually involves pumping your blood through a machine that cleans it and sends it back into your body. It can take several hours, and most people who need the treatment need to have it done 3 times a week at a medical center. About 10% of people who need dialysis use a different kind, called peritoneal dialysis. With this, the space around the organs in your belly is filled with a fluid that draws wastes out. The fluid is then drained out through a tube in your belly. This can be done at home but still needs to be done regularly. If your problem is caused by a long-term illness that has seriously damaged your kidneys, you'll probably need dialysis for the rest of your life, unless you get a kidney from a donor. Doctors do more than 17,000 kidney transplants a year, but there are far fewer kidneys available than there are people who need them. It can take more than 3 years to get a transplant. A kidney transplant is major surgery, and you'll need to be watched carefully by your doctor and take drugs that keep your body from rejecting the new organ for several years afterward."
79,"Experts consider osteoporosis a largely preventable disease. Prevention should start early. Getting enough calcium and vitamin D as a child and teenager can dramatically cut your risks of developing osteoporosis later in life. Even if you're an adult, eating a healthy diet, getting enough calcium and vitamin D, exercising, and avoiding unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking and excessive drinking, may help prevent osteoporosis. After menopause, women who have osteopenia, or thinning of the bones, and who have a high probability for a future fracture from osteoporosis can consider drug therapies to prevent bone loss and reduce their risk of osteoporosis. To learn about osteoporosis prevention techniques, talk to your health care provider. The amount of calcium you need depends on your age. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following: Adolescents should get 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day. Adults from 19 to 50 years of age should get 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. Adult women over the age of 50 should get 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. Adult men should receive 1,000 milligrams up to age 70 and 1,200 milligrams after age 70. Read food labels and select foods that contain 10% or more of the Daily Value for calcium. When food shopping, look for terms such as ""high in calcium,"" ""fortified with calcium,"" ""calcium-rich,"" or ""excellent source of calcium."" If you think you're coming up short, talk to your health care provider about ways you can boost your calcium levels in your diet. Talk to your doctor about what is best for you. Dairy products have high levels of calcium per serving, which is why they're often recommended for bone health. But calcium from other sources -- like spinach, bok choy, and mustard greens, beans, tofu, almonds, fish, and many fortified cereals and juices -- can be just as beneficial. However, it may be difficult to get adequate calcium from food if you don't eat dairy. And osteoporosis experts do say the best source of calcium is from foods, not supplements. Food contains other important nutrients that help the body use calcium. Osteoporosis in children is rare. It's usually the result of a chronic health condition such as asthma or cystic fibrosis that is treated with long-term steroids. Anticonvulsant drugs used to manage epilepsy, or used to manage mania in bipolar disorder, and other conditions may also interfere with calcium and vitamin D metabolism, leading to weak bones. Treatment usually depends on controlling the underlying disease or changing the medication. Sometimes, children will develop osteoporosis with no clear cause. It's called idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, but the good news is that it usually goes away on its own within two to four years. Of course, calcium and vitamin D are the most important nutrients for strong bones and are important for all children whether they have osteoporosis or not. Even if children are healthy now, low levels of calcium and vitamin D can greatly increase their risk of osteoporosis later in life. So keep track of how much calcium your children get from food and ensure they get adequate amounts of vitamin D. If you are worried they aren't getting enough calcium and vitamin D, talk to their health care provider. Don't give them supplements unless they are recommended by your child's health care provider. Our bodies create vitamin D from sunshine -- 10 to 15 minutes of sun a day is all that is needed. During winter, we spend less time outdoors, and we're bundled up against the cold. So some experts think the risk of vitamin D deficiency is higher in winter. But year-round, many of us don't get the vitamin D we need. The Institute of Medicine recommends: 600 IU (international units) a day for adults through age 70 800 IU a day for adults ages 70 and older Vitamin D plays a vital role in getting calcium into the bloodstream from the intestines and the kidneys. Without enough vitamin D, a lot of the calcium you take in from food or supplements could pass out of the body as waste. If you don't get outdoors much or get vitamin D from fortified foods, ask your health care provider about taking vitamin D supplements. Your genes can play a big role in your risk of developing osteoporosis. For instance, studies show that if your parents had a history of bone fractures, you're more likely to have weaker bones and a higher risk of fractures yourself. Your risk of getting osteoporosis is also higher if other family members, like aunts or siblings, had it too. A genetic risk for osteoporosis can be inherited from either your mother or father. If osteoporosis does run in your family, talk to your health care provider. You may need to take extra steps to prevent it. Although the drop in estrogen levels during menopause can result in dramatically thinning of bone and increases your risk of osteoporosis, it isn't the sole cause of the disease. Many other factors -- like your genes, some diseases and treatments, eating disorders, excessive exercising and weight loss , smoking, excess alcohol, and deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D -- can play an important role. Remember that men can get osteoporosis too, even though they don't go through menopause. A bone mineral density test is the typical way of diagnosing osteoporosis and helps to predicting your risk of fractures. It's a kind of X-ray that reveals the hardness of your bones. The most common type is called a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA or DEXA). Usually, the scans look at the weight-bearing ability of your hip and spine, this information is then used to help estimate your risk of fractures. Your doctor will calculate your risk of future fractures with a tool known as a FRAX score and determine whether you would benefit from treatments . A normal bone density is a T-score of plus one (+1) to a score of a minus one (-1). A low bone mass (osteopenia) is a bone density T-score of -1 to -2.5. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density score of -2.5 or below. Although osteoporosis is often thought of as a disease that only affects women, about 20% of cases are in men. But osteoporosis in men is often unrecognized and untreated. And since osteoporosis is a silent disease, the first symptom is often a broken bone. Men who are at higher risk for osteoporosis should focus on prevention. Risk factors for osteoporosis in men include taking certain drugs (like steroids, anticonvulsants, and some cancer treatments), some chronic diseases, smoking, lack of exercise, low testosterone, and a family history of weak bones. If you think you might be at risk, talk to your health care provider."
80,"Different medications can treat allergies, including steroids and allergy shots, but usually the first thing to try is an antihistamine.  When your body comes into contact with whatever your allergy trigger is -- pollen, ragweed, pet dander, or dust mites, for example -- it makes chemicals called histamines. They cause the tissue in your nose to swell (making it stuffy), your nose and eyes to run, and your eyes, nose, and sometimes mouth to itch. Sometimes you may also get an itchy rash on your skin, called hives. Antihistamines reduce or block histamines, so they stop allergy symptoms. These medicines work well to relieve symptoms of different types of allergies, including seasonal (hay fever), indoor, and food allergies. But they can't relieve every symptom. To treat nasal congestion, your doctor may recommend a decongestant. Some medicines combine an antihistamine and decongestant. They come in different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, nasal sprays, and eyedrops. Some are only available by prescription. Others you can buy over the counter ( OTC) at your local pharmacy. Prescription antihistamines include: Azelastine eyedrops ( Optivar) Azelastine nasal sprays ( Astelin, Astepro) Carbinoxamine ( Palgic) Cyproheptadine Desloratadine ( Clarinex) Emedastine eyedrops ( Emadine) Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril) Levocabastine eyedrops ( Livostin) Levocabastine oral ( Xyzal) OTC antihistamines include: Brompheniramine ( Dimetane) Cetirizine ( Zyrtec) Chlorpheniramine ( Chlor- Trimeton) Clemastine ( Tavist) Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) Fexofenadine ( Allegra) Loratadine ( Alavert, Claritin) Eyedrops treat symptoms of eye allergies, including itchy, watery eyes. Some medications combine an antihistamine and a decongestant to ease congestion. Older ones tend to cause more side effects, particularly drowsiness. Newer antihistamines have fewer side effects, so they may be a better choice for some people. Some of the main side effects of antihistamines include: Dry mouth Drowsiness Dizziness Nausea and vomiting Restlessness or moodiness (in some children) Trouble peeing or not being able to pee Blurred vision Confusion If you take an antihistamine that causes drowsiness, do so before bedtime. Don't take it during the day before you drive or use machinery. Read the label before you take an allergy drug. Antihistamines may interact with other medications you are taking. Talk to your doctor first if you have an enlarged prostate, heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, kidney or liver disease, a bladder obstruction, or glaucoma. Also check with your doctor if you are pregnant or nursing."
81,"From supplements to guided meditation, your diabetes treatment could include traditional medicines, alternative therapies, and natural remedies, too. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a ""group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine."" Complementary medicine is used with conventional treatments, whereas alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Although some may be effective, others aren't or can even be harmful. If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you. Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes. Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called ""obesity remedies"" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed. You should talk to your doctor about any drugs, herbal products, or alternative and complementary treatments to make sure they're not going to interfere with your treatment or cause other problems. Beware of claims that seem too good to be true. Look for scientific-based sources of information. The National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse collects resource information for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK) Reference Collection, a service of the National Institutes of Health. To learn more about alternative therapies for diabetes treatment, contact the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Select brands of natural products carefully -- ""natural"" doesn't automatically mean it's good for you. Avoid products made with more than one herb. Read labels: Look for the herb's common and scientific name, the name and address of the manufacturer, a batch and lot number, expiration date, dosage guidelines, and potential side effects. Stop taking the product and call your doctor right away if you: Feel queasy or throw up Have a fast heartbeat Feel more anxious, worried, or unsettled than usual Can't sleep Get diarrhea Get skin rashes"
82,"Do you have problems seeing at night? Millions of Americans do. You may just need glasses, especially if you're nearsighted. On the other hand, it could mean that you have cataracts or other issues. If you're afraid to hit the road after dark because you can't see, let your doctor know. A wide range of conditions -- from sun exposure to diabetes -- makes it hard to see at night: Cataracts . Your eye's lens is right behind the pupil. As you age, cells grow and die inside it. That builds up debris and leads to cataracts. They don't hurt, but they do get worse and slowly cloud your lens. The first symptom is often worse night vision. Because cataracts distort the light that comes into your eyes, you may see halos around lights -- again, mostly at night. Blurry vision is also common. Lack of vitamin A. It's found in carrots and leafy vegetables. It helps keep the retina -- the back of your eye where images are focused -- healthy. Most Americans get enough vitamin A in their diets, but if you have a health issue that makes it hard for you to absorb nutrients ( Crohn's disease, celiac disease, gastric bypass), you might have night vision problems. Not enough zinc. Without it, vitamin A may not work as well as it should. The result: night blindness. Beef, poultry, beans, and nuts are rich sources. Most people in the U. S. get plenty of it from their food. Retinitis pigmentosa. This rare genetic disorder affects young people, usually before age 30. A decline in night vision is often the earliest symptom. Some people lose all their sight. Others keep some vision. Sunlight exposure. Prolonged exposure to sunlight is a major risk factor for cataract development, is a major cause for poor night vision. Always wear your sunglasses when you're out in the sun to help prevent this. LASIK surgery problems. Complications after LASIK surgery are uncommon. But a few people have night vision problems after it. Complaints include glare and halos around objects, both of which distort vision. You may have symptoms during the day, too. They become more noticeable and bothersome, though, at night. The characteristics of your eyes may make you more prone to night vision problems after LASIK. So ask your doctor to check to see if you're at risk. Diabetes . It makes you more likely to have night vision problems. Over years, high blood sugar damages the blood vessels and nerves in your eyes, which leads to a condition called retinopathy. If you have trouble seeing in low light, either indoors or outside, talk to your doctor. A simple exam and conversation at an eye doctor's office can show the cause of your night blindness. The doctor will use drops to open your eyes up wide (he'll call this dilation). Then he'll look into them with a slit-lamp, an upright microscope with a bright light on it. What you can do for night blindness depends on the cause. Cataracts are removed surgically. The doctor will replace your clouded natural lens with a clear artificial model known as an intraocular lens. Most people have much better vision afterward, but some still need glasses. Diabetic retinopathy is easy to prevent if you keep tight control of blood sugar levels with medicines and diet. One treatment uses a laser to destroy the tiny blood vessels that threaten your vision. This process, called panretinal photocoagulation, will preserve your overall sight but could reduce your night vision. Lack of vitamin A or zinc aren't common causes of night blindness. But it won't hurt to eat foods rich in these nutrients if you have trouble seeing at night."
83,"Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump blood effectively to the lungs or the rest of the body. This can be because the person has developed a weakened heart muscle or because the heart muscle has thickened or stiffened, making it difficult to fill the heart and backing up blood into the lungs. With heart failure, the weakened heart pumps less blood than usual, causing the kidneys and adrenal glands to produce chemicals that help the body to hold onto salt and water. In addition, the blood vessels constrict, raising blood pressure. This makes it even harder for the heart to push blood through the arteries. Because the body is retaining salt and water or the heart is unable to pump blood forward, water may pool in the legs and ankles, causing them to swell. Fluid may also collect in the lungs and interfere with the ability to breathe, especially when lying down. Left untreated, heart failure worsens and may prevent the heart from pumping enough blood to keep the person alive. Doctors divide heart failure cases into four levels of increasing severity: Class I: Physical activity is unaffected, and the patient has no unusual fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, or pain during normal activities. Class II: Slight limitations on normal activities. The patient may experience mild fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, or pain during normal activities; no symptoms at rest. Class III: Marked limitation on normal activities. The patient experiences fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, or pain during less than normal activities; no symptoms at rest. Class IV: The patient is uncomfortable even at rest. Discomfort increases with any physical activity. Doctors also classify heart failure according to whether it is primarily a problem of pumping the blood out of the heart due to a weakened heart muscle, or if the patient has problems primarily with filling the heart due to a stiff heart muscle (also called heart failure with normal ejection fraction). Heart failure with normal ejection fraction now accounts for almost half of the heart failure seen in the U. S. and is the dominant type of heart failure seen in the elderly. About 5.8 million Americans have heart failure, which contributes to about 282,000 deaths each year. Although treatment of heart failure has led to improved survival rates, as many as ten percent of patients with mild heart failure and more than 50% of patients with more severe heart failure die annually. Heart failure is the single most frequent cause of hospitalization for Americans ages 65 and older. The most common causes of heart failure are: Coronary artery disease (narrowing or hardening of arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, usually caused by a buildup of fats and cholesterol) High blood pressure (hypertension) Many people with heart failure have both coronary artery disease and hypertension. Heart failure may also be caused by other conditions that weaken or interfere with the heart's function, including: Previous heart attack Heart valve disease Dysfunction of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Heart defects present at birth Infection of the heart valves or muscle (endocarditis or myocarditis) Diabetes Chronic kidney disease"
84,"Your liver helps clean your blood, digest food, and store sugar that your body uses for energy. Typically, its cells chug along doing their job until they wear out or get damaged. Then they die and new ones take their place. It's all very orderly. But when you have primary liver cancer, those cells grow at a pace that's out of control. Cancer cells start to take over and make it hard for your normal cells to do their job. Primary means the cancer starts in your liver. If it starts somewhere else and spreads to your liver, it's called secondary liver cancer, and it's treated differently. Children and adults can both get primary liver cancer, but it's more common when you're older. There are different types and many ways to treat it. Your doctor can help you understand the best choices for you. Hepatocellular cancer ( HCC) is by far the most common type of cancer that starts in the liver. Most people who get it also have an ongoing (or âchronicâ) liver disease, such as cirrhosis. It's found more often in men than women. Other types of primary liver cancer include: Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). The liver makes bile, which helps you digest fats. Bile moves out of the liver in tubes called bile ducts. This cancer occurs in those tubes. Fibrolamellar HCC. This is a type of HCC that doesn't happen very often. Unlike typical HCC, it's usually found in women under 35 who don't have liver disease. Hemangiosarcomas and angiosarcomas. Both of these cancers are found in the liver's blood vessels. Hepatoblastoma. This rare cancer is usually found in children younger than 3. When it's caught early, treatment can be very successful. It's often not clear what causes liver cancer, but you may be more likely to get it if you have: Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV) or chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV) infection, both of which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer Cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis or years of heavy drinking Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease -- common with obese people, even if they don't drink Certain liver diseases, such as hemochromatosis (when your body absorbs too much iron) and Wilson's disease (when your body absorbs too much copper) Type 2 diabetes If you're very overweight or drink heavily for many years, you're more likely to get cirrhosis, which can make you more likely to get liver cancer. Also, if you've eaten foods with aflatoxins, you have a higher chance of getting this cancer. Aflatoxins are poisons made by a fungus that grows on some crops, such as corn and peanuts, when they aren't stored the right way. Early on, it's likely you won't notice anything at all. When they do show up, you may have very general symptoms such as: Fever Feeling like you might throw up No desire to eat Weakness or feeling more tired than usual You may also have: A hard lump on the right side of your belly just below your ribcage Pain on the upper right side of your belly or in your right shoulder blade and back Swelling in your belly Weight loss for no reason White, chalky stool or dark urine Yellowish eyes and skin Typically, your doctor starts with a physical exam to check for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. You'll also talk about your health history. Your doctor may then do: Blood tests to look for certain substances that could be signs of cancer Imaging, such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound to see how many tumors you have and where they are located A biopsy, where cells or tissues are removed to see if they're cancerous. This can be done either with a needle placed into the tumor or through surgery to remove part of the tumor. In some cases, you won't need a biopsy because imaging is enough to tell that it's cancer. These depend on your age, overall health, how advanced the cancer is, and what you prefer. Different treatments can have different side effects, and you may need more than one. Surgery: If you have just one small tumor and your cancer hasn't spread, you may have surgery to remove it along with part of your liver. If you have liver disease though, that's not an option. You may get a liver transplant instead, but these aren't too common. Tumor ablation: A number of treatments kill tumors without removing them from your body. This is called tumor ablation and can be done with: Alcohol. In ethanol ablation, also called percutaneous ethanol injection, your doctor injects pure alcohol into the tumor to kill the cancer cells. Freezing. In cryoablation, also called cryosurgery or cryotherapy, your doctor uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy the tumor. Heat. Your doctor uses probes with either electricity (radiofrequency ablation) or microwaves (microwave thermotherapy) to heat and kill the tumor. Embolization therapy (reduced blood flow): Your liver gets blood from two blood vessels. Most normal liver cells get it from one blood vessel and cancer cells get it from the other. With embolization therapy, your doctor cuts off the blood flow to the cancer cells to kill the tumor. Radiation therapy: This treatment uses high-powered radiation from X-rays and other sources to kill cancer cells. You can either get radiation from outside the body or have it placed inside. Beads filled with radiation are sometimes used in radioembolization therapy. Targeted drug therapy: These medications work differently than chemotherapy medicines. They go after very specific changes in cancer cells to try and destroy them. Since chemotherapy often isn't helpful for primary liver cancer, doctors have been trying more targeted medications. Chemotherapy: This uses medications to treat cancer. For liver cancer, it's usually done with a pump placed in your body so the medicine goes right to your liver, not your whole body. Chemotherapy that you take by mouth or injection isn't usually helpful for liver cancer."
85,"Benign rolandic epilepsy is one form of epilepsy. With this condition, seizures affect the face and sometimes the body. As a result, the disorder causes problems for some children. It almost always disappears, though, by adolescence. Benign rolandic epilepsy accounts for about 15% of the cases of epilepsy in children. On average, children are between 6 and 8 years old when they first develop seizures from benign rolandic epilepsy. Adults aren't affected by this form of epilepsy, however. It's called ""rolandic"" because seizures originate in the rolandic area of the brain. That's the area that controls the face. Because these seizures begin in a specific part of the brain, they are called partial seizures. Benign rolandic epilepsy is also called ""benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes."" This refers to a pattern of brain waves it often creates on an electroencephalogram ( EEG). No one knows what causes benign rolandic epilepsy. Children who have close relatives with epilepsy are slightly more likely to develop the condition. Like all forms of epilepsy, benign rolandic epilepsy results in seizures. The seizures in benign rolandic epilepsy are usually mild. They typically begin in the face and can take a variety of forms: face or cheek twitching tingling, numbness, or unusual sensations in the tongue or face difficulty speaking drooling due to inability to control the mouth muscles In about one out of every two children with benign rolandic epilepsy, seizures spread from the rolandic area to the rest of the brain. When this happens, the seizure is called a secondarily generalized seizure. They are also called tonic-clonic seizures. Their symptoms are more alarming to witness: unresponsiveness clenching of muscles all over the body for a short period rhythmic convulsions of the whole body confusion and disorientation upon regaining consciousness Typically in benign rolandic epilepsy, the seizures occur during sleep. For this reason, they may not be noticed at all. Other times, parents witness a seizure after investigating nighttime noises in their child's room. Some children with benign rolandic epilepsy may also have: learning difficulties behavioral problems These children with benign rolandic epilepsy may need additional attention and treatment. When seizures are mild and only occur during sleep, benign rolandic epilepsy can easily go undiagnosed. Often, parents bring a child to the doctor after a tonic-clonic seizure during sleep. Doctors diagnose benign rolandic epilepsy based on the pattern of seizures. They also gather information from multiple tests: Electroencephalogram ( EEG): By attaching a set of adhesive electrodes to the scalp, a technician records brain waves during this painless test. A neurologist interprets the EEG. Children with benign rolandic epilepsy often have spikes on their EEG tracings that help make the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI): This high-resolution scan of the brain is normal in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. Getting an MRI is noisy and can cause anxiety, but it's painless. Neurologic exam: Children with benign rolandic epilepsy generally have a normal neurologic exam. Often in benign rolandic epilepsy, no treatment is needed or recommended. Seizures in benign rolandic epilepsy are usually mild, harmless, and infrequent. Virtually all children outgrow the condition. Children might benefit from treatment if they're having any of these problems related to benign rolandic epilepsy: learning difficulties problems thinking or concentrating behavior problems daytime seizures frequent seizures Anti-seizure medications like Tegretol (carbamazepine), Trileptal (oxcarbazepine), or Neurontin (gabapentin) are most often prescribed to treat benign rolandic epilepsy. In some studies, treatment reduced tonic-clonic seizures, but facial seizures continued."
86,"No one likes the smell of a dirty litter box. But can you imagine if you were the one that had to use that box? No wonder studies have found that at least 10% of cats stop using their litter boxes reliably at some point. Of course there can be medical or behavioral reasons for the problems. But not using the litter box often is traced to nothing more than a dirty litter box. Here’s how to avoid litter box odor and keep your house smelling fresh, which should make you and kitty happier. The No. 1 rule, and the only thing that will keep litter box odor at bay, is constant cleaning. That means scooping the box out at least twice a day, removing the solids and liquid clumps if you use clumping litter. For those who don’t use clumping litter, use a large, solid metal spoon (such as a large kitchen spoon) to lift out the most urine-soaked areas each time you clean. Add litter as needed to replace what is removed. Also wash the box weekly, or every other week if you are using clumping litter. Use a mild, unscented dish detergent or a mild bleach spray (20 parts water to one part bleach) and rinse well. Clean your scooper also. When dry, add 2 to 3 inches of litter. Cats don’t like a deep tray of litter and this allows you to add litter as you scoop. Some litters have perfumes or other additives that claim to help cover litter smell. But to a cat these can smell overwhelming and make the box unwelcoming. Most veterinarians advise against using these products. Many believe that clumping litters, which allow for the easy removal of solids and liquids, keep boxes smelling fresher. But cats can be very particular about which litters they will use. So experiment to find the litter your cat likes best, then stick with it. Almost any easily cleaned plastic container can be used as a litter box, but buy the largest box your home can accommodate. A rule of thumb is to get a box that is at least twice as long as your adult cat and as wide as the cat is long. Cats are fastidious, and don’t want to step or dig in already soiled areas. Many people cut down one side of a large, plastic storage tub to get a larger box. And avoid covered boxes. Most cats don’t like them, and they can trap odors inside, making it unpleasant for your pet to enter. Many cats also don’t like plastic liners, which can snare cat’s claws when they dig. This also allows urine to seep under the liner, where it won’t be absorbed by the litter and can cause odors. As for self-cleaning litter boxes, it depends. Some cats, especially skittish and large cats, may dislike them. But if your cat doesn’t mind, it’s an option for people who are gone for long periods. The rule is one litter box per cat, plus one. So if you have one cat, you need two boxes. If you have four cats, you need five boxes. Keep the boxes in different locations in your home. If a cat is on the third floor, and the box is in the basement, he may decide not to make the long trek. Also, choose the right spots for your litter boxes. Don’t put a box in a small, enclosed area, like a tiny bathroom or closet, which will concentrate litter box odors. A larger, well-ventilated area is best. But it needs to be in a quiet, low-traffic area, away from your cat’s food, other pets, and anything that can startle or scare your cat while he’s using the box. Yes, it takes a daily effort on your part to keep litter box odors at bay. But the result will be a happier cat and a better-smelling home."
87,"If you're traveling with children, the last thing you want is for them to spend their vacation sick in bed. But how cautious should you be about germs and illness when traveling with kids in the U. S.? Experts agree that a few major precautions, like washing hands frequently, are critical to keeping nasty germs from making children ill while traveling. But beyond those, how careful you are about germs on the road depends on how careful you are about germs at home. If you don't mind your children crawling around in other people's homes, it's probably not a big deal for them to crawl around in a hotel as long as you check first for safety hazards and wash their hands afterward. But what if the thought of your child touching a hotel room floor or snuggling up in an airplane blanket makes you feel ill? You may be more comfortable taking more measures, experts say. And some children are just more prone to illness when traveling than others. In either case, you'll probably feel more comfortable taking extra care. Here are some strategies you can use to help keep illness at bay when traveling with healthy children. If you are planning to travel with a newborn infant or a child with a compromised immune system, talk to your child's doctor first about special precautions. Are children more vulnerable to illness when traveling? Yes, and experts point to two main reasons: Most children are not particularly good about keeping things out of their mouths, and they aren't particularly careful with hand hygiene. In addition, children's immune systems are less developed than those of adults, and this makes them more vulnerable to illness. These three strategies can help protect them: Make sure your child is up to date on immunizations, even when traveling in the U. S. Be sure your child has had routine vaccinations for measles, whooping cough, and other serious illnesses on the normal CDC schedule. And anyone in your travel party who hasn't gotten a yearly flu shot should consider getting one before heading out. The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for everyone six months old and older. A flu shot provides double benefits. It protects your child and helps cut down on the general level of flu being transmitted. Practice good hand hygiene. Washing hands often, especially before meals, is the No. 1 way to prevent illness, at home or while traveling. Of course, you should help small children wash hands and teach older kids how to wash them thoroughly. Using warm soap and water, lather up and scrub all over for 20 seconds, then rinse and dry. While you're at it, encourage your kids not to put dirty hands -- or other things -- in their mouth. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Children should wash their hands with soap and water when they can, but you should have a sanitizing gel or wipes with at least 60% alcohol available when soap and water aren't. This is especially important in places where it may be difficult to get to a restroom, such as at amusement parks or even on airplanes. Make sure children rub hand sanitizer all over their hands until dry. If you can see dirt on their hands, however, hand sanitizers won't be enough. Hand sanitizers are dangerous for children if they swallow any, so store them in a bag safely away from small children, and supervise their use. Airplanes have gotten a reputation as flying cold-and-flu factories. But it's actually hard to determine just what role they play in making children, or adults, sick during travel. Experts agree that when kids have more contact with other people, they're more likely to get sick. But that can happen anywhere there are lots of people -- including malls, restaurants, or rest stops. Concerns about airplane germs often focus on air quality. A 2008 study of cabin-air bacteria in 12 commercial airplanes showed, though, they do not pose a risk for healthy passengers. And experts say your risk of getting a respiratory infection is higher on a bus or in an airport than on a plane. A bigger concern, according to some experts, is airplane surfaces. The majority of infections, including respiratory infections, are passed by contact occurring within a very short distance rather than through the air. Consider these measures if you're concerned about airplane germs: Sanitize ""high touch"" areas. Germs linger longer on nonporous materials like plastic. Wipe down surfaces such as tray tables, seat armrests, and lavatory door handles with an alcohol-based wipe or gel before your child uses them. With the short cleaning time between flights, these areas do not always get cleaned and disinfected. Avoid touching restroom surfaces. When washing your child's hands in an airplane or other public restroom, turn off the faucet with a paper towel. Then use another paper towel to dry hands and open the door. Bring your own blankets and pillows. If airplane blankets or pillows aren't delivered to you in a package, chances are they've been used. Having a familiar blanket and pillow to curl up with may also make children more comfortable during air travel. Drink bottled water. In water quality tests on 158 airplanes in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) discovered coliform bacteria and E. coli in some water samples. In 2009, the EPA established tougher rules for airplane water. Generally, however, the numbers of food- and water-borne illnesses from airplane travel are low. Ask sick passengers near you to observe cold and flu etiquette. If someone near you isn't covering coughs or sneezes, ask him to, even if it makes you feel awkward to do so. And be sure you do the same. Also, make sure your child coughs or sneezes into a tissue or her elbow and washes her hands afterward. Put distance between your child and sick passengers. Ask the flight attendant if you and your child can move to another row. If that's not possible, take the seat next to the sick person instead of putting your child there. You're likely to be more conscious of what you touch and how to prevent infection. Hotels. One study found that when people with colds stayed overnight in hotel rooms, many surfaces remained contaminated with rhinovirus for at least a day. But how concerned should you be? Health experts point out that most hotel rooms are better cleaned than most homes. Towels and sheets are changed daily, and the room is cleaned somewhat every day. Still, experts suggest wiping down remote controls, light switches, telephones, doorknobs, toilet seat handles, faucet handles, and other high-touch areas as a precaution when traveling with children. Amusement parks. Be careful what you eat. Avoid food that may have been sitting out for a long time. Since you can't wipe down germy surfaces at amusement parks, hand hygiene is especially important. Swimming pools and water parks. Have kids rinse off before and after taking the plunge at pools and water parks. These can be breeding grounds for pinkeye (conjunctivitis), skin viruses, and cryptosporidium and giardia, which cause diarrhea. Chlorination does not kill all bacteria. Also teach young children to avoid swallowing water in pools and water parks. Too many treats, not enough sleep, and being on the go can wear down children's immunity. This can make them more vulnerable to illness. These strategies can help kids stay healthy on the road: Encourage children to drink liquids. Stick closely to your child's normal, healthy diet. This not only gives kids nutrients to help fight infection -- it can also help prevent diarrhea or constipation, which children are prone to when traveling. Consider bringing your kids' favorite healthy foods on road trips or airplanes instead of buying fast food or snacks. Don't skimp on sleep. Sticking to your children's normal bedtime and naptime will help them sleep better. Packing favorite stuffed animals or blankets can also help children sleep in strange places so they get enough rest. Whatever strategies you use to keep harmful bacteria at bay, try to keep germs and illness in perspective. It's not uncommon for healthy children, especially under age 5, to get several colds a year -- and usually not from strangers on the road. Most often infections come from the people we love."
88,"Clinical depression has been linked to other mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorders, panic disorder, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Together, these conditions affect millions of Americans. Fortunately, these disorders are treatable, and those affected can lead normal, productive lives. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, but when it takes on a life of its own it becomes an unhealthy, generalized reaction that affects the body and mind. Symptoms can include rapid heartbeat, aches and pains, and muscle tension. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 18% of adults in the United States suffer from an anxiety disorder in any given year, and anxiety disorders are prevalent in 25% of children ages 13 to 18. Like depression, anxiety is thought to arise from a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. Although anxiety is not always present in depressive disorders, most of the time it lurks beneath the surface. But true depression differs from an anxiety disorder in that a depressed mood is typically its most obvious symptom, whereas anxiety is the primary sign of an authentic anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders include: Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD) Panic disorder Specific phobias Social anxiety disorder Previously, two other conditions -- obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) -- had been classified by the American Psychiatric Association as being subtypes of anxiety disorders. However, in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5), each of these conditions is now classified as its own separate type of disorder. Anxiety disorders affect women twice as frequently as they do men. And many studies show that people with depression often experience symptoms of an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder that's left untreated can cause unnecessary suffering and impairment for both the person who has one and the person's family. People with generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD) are filled with greatly exaggerated worry and tension -- even though there is usually nothing beyond ordinary concerns to worry about. These individuals anticipate disaster and ruminate about their health, their finances, their work, their relationships and family problems. To make a diagnosis of GAD, excessive worrying and anxiety have to occur more days than not for at least 6 months. The person is unable to control the worry and may have other symptoms including: Difficulty concentrating Fatigue Irritability Muscle tension Restlessness Sleep disturbance This anxiety disorder is not related to substance abuse or a medical condition. It occurs independently. Panic disorder is another type of generalized anxiety disorder that often co-exists with depression. Panic disorder affects 6 million Americans every year, most often young adults. Panic disorder involves the sudden onset of overwhelming fear and terror. The person may also experience: Chest pain Choking Difficulty breathing Dizziness Gastrointestinal distress Headache Shortness of breath Sweaty palms Tachycardia (an unusually rapid heart beat) Trembling The person feels like he or she is either going to faint, have a heart attack and die, or go crazy. For somebody to be diagnosed with panic attack, at least four of the following symptoms need to be present: Chest pain Choking sensation Dizziness Extreme sweating Fast heartbeat Fear of dying Feeling of losing control Feelings of unreality or being detached from oneself Hot flashes or chills Nausea Numbness Shakiness Shortness of breath These symptoms are often accompanied by worry over the implications of the attack -- like fear of death from a heart attack -- and altered behavior, like avoiding a particular place because of the attack. Specific phobias are the most common type of anxiety disorder. They involve an unreasonable or irrational fear of something that poses little or no real danger. The fear can be of a situation, object, or event. If people with phobias can't avoid what they fear, then it immediately results in a marked anxiety response. This response can include rapid heartbeat, nausea, or profuse sweating. Phobias are common and strike one out of 10 Americans, with women twice as likely to have a phobia as men. Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is a psychological condition that causes an overwhelming fear of situations that require interacting with another person or performing in front of others. Unlike being shy around strangers or nervous before a performance, social anxiety is a fear that you might humiliate yourself with your actions or speech in public. Social phobia is common. It affects more than 15 million people in any given year. It often begins in childhood and rarely develops after age 25. People with social phobia are often aware that their fears are irrational, but they are unable to ease or erase these fears. The symptoms of social phobia are much the same as symptoms for other anxiety disorders. They include: Difficulty talking Dry mouth Intense sweating Nausea Racing heart Trembling or shaking Like with other anxiety illnesses, symptoms can be tolerable or so severe that they become socially debilitating. Schizophrenia is a type of major psychotic illness that is usually marked by an inability to distinguish the real from the imaginary, confused or jumbled thoughts, and hallucinations. Feelings of emptiness and sadness may be a symptom of the disorder, but schizophrenia and depression are different on a neurobiological level. About half of people with schizophrenia may develop a major depressive episode at some point in their lives, but depression is not considered an enduring or hallmark feature of schizophrenia. Eating disorders frequently occur with depression and anxiety disorders. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, eating disorders are marked by extremes. They occur when someone severely reduces food intake or overeats to the extreme. Treatment may include antidepressants. The two most common types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Eating disorders are more common among teenage girls and women. These disorders often get worse the longer they go untreated. The lack of nutrition associated with eating disorders can harm the body's organs and, in severe cases, lead to death. People with anorexia purposefully starve themselves, despite their hunger. They tend to excel in sports, school, and work -- often seeking perfection. Some people with anorexia stop eating in order to gain a feeling of control over their lives. Others may do so to rebel against parents and other loved ones. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa requires that a person weigh at least 15% less than his or her ideal body weight. It is estimated that up to 3.7% of females will suffer from anorexia at some time during their lives. Anorexia is primarily a food restriction disorder. However, it is not uncommon for people with anorexia to purge, or empty themselves, through vomiting and abuse of laxatives, enemas, and diuretics. People with bulimia nervosa eat large amounts of food all at once and then vomit. The vomiting may occur multiple times during a day. The vomiting is triggered by a fear of weight gain or stomach discomfort. People with bulimia also use laxatives, diuretics, and vigorous exercise to purge themselves. In order for a person to be diagnosed with bulimia, this behavior must occur at least twice a week for three months in a row. Although people with bulimia are often underweight, they may also have a normal body weight. It is estimated that bulimia will affect up to 4.2% of females at some point in their lives. Substance use disorders -- which are linked to depression -- involve the use of drugs or alcohol to the point of social, financial, legal, occupational, or physical harm. Millions of Americans abuse drugs or alcohol for a variety of reasons, among them to cope with stress and anxiety. Biological factors, such as a genetic tendency, may also play a role. Substance abuse may include some of the following symptoms: Continuing to use the substance despite the knowledge of its harmful effects on one's physical and mental condition Finding it impossible to discontinue use despite making efforts Giving up or reducing social, recreational, and work-related activities because of substance use Increasing the amount of a substance used over time Spending lots of time and effort either getting the substance or recovering from its use Needing to increase the amounts of a substance in order to become intoxicated, or experiencing a diminished effect from continued use of the same amount. Taking more of the substance to ease withdrawal symptoms Withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, shaking, insomnia, agitation, hallucination, and sweating following a reduction in the amount of a substance taken There are varied approaches to treating people with substance abuse plus depression. Some will need detoxification in a hospital or a clinic. Rehabilitation may include one-on-one counseling, group counseling, and support groups. Antidepressant medicines -- in combination with education to help people address and conquer the emotions that cause them to abuse drugs or alcohol -- can also be effective."

90,"Did you know that yeast infections can happen anywhere in the body, including your mouth and skin? They can also get into your blood. More than 20 types of candida (yeast) normally live in your GI tract, on your skin, and in your mucus membranes without causing any problems. Their growth is kept in check by bacteria. But when something happens to kill off the bacteria or change the conditions where yeast lives, it can multiply and cause mild to serious infections. This article touches on the most common causes. Antibiotics. If you use broad-spectrum antibiotics like tetracycline or amoxicillin to fight off another infection, these antibiotics can also kill off the healthy bacteria that keep the yeast in check. Corticosteroids. The use of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma is linked to oral candidiasis (thrush), a yeast infection in your mouth. People who wear dentures, particularly those who also have diabetes, may be more likely to get thrush. Clean your dentures thoroughly each night to prevent infection. Some products can change the acidity level in your vagina. That encourages the growth of yeast and can remove the helpful bacteria that keep yeast at bay. The change in estrogen and progesterone levels in women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, using hormone replacement therapy, or taking birth control with estrogen can lead to vaginal yeast infections. Wearing underwear (or tight jeans or a wet swimsuit) that doesn't breathe can increase body heat and moisture in the vagina. This creates conditions yeast likes to grow in. Choose underwear with a cotton crotch, and change out of swimsuits and workout clothes as soon as possible. Change babies' diapers often. Soiled and wet diapers can lead to diaper rash. Once the skin is irritated, a yeast infection can set in. Diabetes. If your diabetes isn't well-controlled, the increase in sugar in the mucus membranes (moist tissues) of your vagina can create a fertile environment yeast to grow. Weakened immune system. If you have HIV/ AIDS or another condition that hampers your immune system, your body can't fight off infections as well. If you're getting cancer treatment or have had an organ transplant, your chances of getting yeast infections like thrush or invasive candidiasis are higher. Hospitalization. When yeast enters the bloodstream, doctors call that invasive candidiasis. It's most common in people who have recently been admitted to a hospital or live in another type of health care facility, such as a nursing home."
91,"Every woman is different. Some with rheumatoid arthritis find that menopause can affect their RA. Researchers aren't sure why, but hormones seem to play a role in RA. Nearly three times as many women get the disease as men. Many women who have it see their symptoms improve while they're pregnant. This may be because their estrogen levels go up during pregnancy. Estrogen levels drop around the time of menopause. When that happens, RA symptoms may worsen. Some women first get symptoms around the time they start menopause. You might think that taking estrogen would reduce RA symptoms along with the symptoms of menopause, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And because hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) is linked with heart disease -- another increased risk for women with rheumatoid arthritis - doctors rarely recommend it for treating menopause symptoms in women with RA. Rheumatoid arthritis makes osteoporosis more likely. So does menopause. Those are good reasons for women with RA to get their bone density levels checked and make sure they get enough calcium and vitamin D. Your rheumatologist can calculate your odds of getting a bone fracture over the next 10 years by giving you a DEXA scan to measure your bone density. They'll find the best treatment or prevention plan for you. Your doctor may recommend that you take prescription drugs to keep up your bone density and strength. RA can sometimes make it tough to have a good sex life. On top of that, menopause can increase vaginal dryness, making sex painful. Many women with RA also have SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, an immune system condition that attacks moisture-producing glands in the body. It can cause vaginal dryness and make sex painful. Talk to your doctor about lubricants that may help. If you're concerned about joint pain during sex, these ideas can help: Some positions -- like lying side by side with your partner -- can take the stress off your hips or other affected joints. You can also plan intimacy for the times of day when you usually feel less pain. Menopause and pain can affect your desire. Your partner may also be afraid that they'll cause you pain. It can help if both of you talk together with a doctor or counselor. Menopause can make the fatigue that comes with RA worse. If you don't get enough sleep at night or you think your RA treatment isn't working as well as it should be, tell your doctor. Also talk to your doctor if you feel depressed. Many people with RA have depression as well, and although it's not a normal part of menopause, it's something to watch out for. Psychotherapy, exercise, and antidepressants can treat depression. Exercise is a simple thing that helps most women with RA feel better, including women who are going through or have been through menopause. It gives you more energy and joint flexibility, eases depression, and fights heart disease. It curbs the weight gain and insomnia that often come with menopause. Weight-bearing exercise helps protect against osteoporosis. Your doctor or a physical therapist can work with you to create a fun, safe exercise program."
92," Dementia is the name for a group of brain disorders that make it hard to remember, think clearly, make decisions, or even control your emotions. Alzheimer's disease is one of those disorders, but there are many different types and causes of dementia. Dementia isn't just about simple memory mishaps -- like forgetting someone's name or where you parked. A person with dementia has a hard time with at least two of the following: Memory Communication and speech Focus and concentration Reasoning and judgment Visual perception (can't see the difference in colors or detect movement, or sees things that aren't there) Since some types of dementia share similar symptoms, it can be hard for a doctor to figure out which one you or your loved one has. Be sure to tell him about all symptoms, medication and alcohol use, and previous illnesses to help him make the right diagnosis. This is the most common type of dementia. About 60% to 80% of people who have dementia have Alzheimer's. It's a progressive condition, which means it gets worse over time, and it usually affects people over 65 years old. There's currently no cure. It happens when proteins (called plaques) and fibers (called tangles) build up in your brain and block nerve signals and destroy nerve cells. Memory loss may be mild at first, but symptoms become worse over time. It gets more difficult to carry on a conversation or perform everyday tasks. Confusion, aggression, and mood changes are other common symptoms. A doctor can't say you have Alzheimer's with absolute certainty, but there are things he can do to be fairly sure. They include tests of your attention, memory, language, and vision, and looking at images of the brain. These images are taken with an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures. Vascular dementia: This is the second most common type. About 1 in 10 people who have dementia have vascular dementia, which happens when there's not enough blood going to your brain. This can be caused by damage to your blood vessels or blockages that lead to mini-strokes or brain bleeding. Doctors used to call it multi-infarct or post-stroke dementia. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, memory loss isn't the typical first symptom. Instead, people with vascular dementia can have different signs, depending on the area of the brain that's affected, such as problems with planning or judgment. No drugs have been approved to treat this type of dementia, but you can do some things to keep your brain and blood vessels healthy and try to prevent future damage. These include exercising, eating well, and not smoking. Dementia with Lewy bodies: Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein. They build up in your cortex, the part of your brain that handles learning and memory. This type of dementia causes problems with attention and things like driving early on, along with sleeping issues, seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations), and slowed, unbalanced movements, similar to Parkinson's disease symptoms. Memory loss tends to show up later in the disease. Mixed dementia: Sometimes, a person has brain changes caused by more than one type of dementia. This is called mixed dementia. For example, you may have blocked or damaged blood vessels in your brain (vascular dementia) and brain plaques and tangles ( Alzheimer's disease) at the same time. Frontotemporal Dementia ( FTD): This form of dementia involves the loss of nerve cells in the front and side areas of your brain -- behind your forehead and ears. Personality and behavior changes and trouble with language are the main symptoms. Some people also have a hard time with writing and comprehension. Symptoms usually show up around age 60 -- earlier than they usually start with Alzheimer's disease. Types of frontotemporal dementia include behavioral variant FTD (bv FTD), primary progressive aphasia, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease ( CJD): This rare form of dementia happens when a protein, called a prion, folds into an abnormal shape, and other prions start to do the same. This damages brain cells and triggers a fast mental decline. People with CJD also have mood changes, confusion, twitchy or jerky movements, and trouble walking. Sometimes, the disease is passed down through families, but it also can happen for no known reason. One type, called variant CJD (or mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy), has spread from cattle to people in certain situations. Huntington's disease : This is caused by a problem with a gene you get from one of your parents. It affects the central part of your brain -- the area that helps you think, move, and show emotion. Symptoms typically start between ages 30 and 50, and uncontrolled arm, leg, head, face, and upper body movements are the first signs. The brain changes also lead to problems with memory, concentration, judgment, reasoning, and planning. People with Huntington's disease also have issues with depression, anger, and irritability. There's no known cure for it. Normal pressure hydrocephalus: The Alzheimer's Association includes this buildup of spinal fluid in the brain as a form of dementia. Symptoms include slowed thinking, problems with decision making, trouble concentrating, behavior changes, difficulty walking, and loss of bladder control. It typically strikes adults in their 60s or 70s. Surgery to put a shunt in your brain to get rid of extra fluid can help."
93,"Being constipated means your bowel movements are tough or happen less often than normal. Almost everyone goes through it at some point.  Although it's not usually serious, you'll feel much better when your body is back on track. The normal length of time between bowel movements varies widely from person to person. Some people have them three times a day. Others have them just a few times a week. Going longer than 3 or more days without one, though, is usually too long. After 3 days, your poop gets harder and more difficult to pass. You may have: Few bowel movements Trouble having a bowel movement (straining to go) Hard or small stools A sense that everything didn't come out Belly bloating You also may feel like you need help to empty your bowels, such as pressing on your belly or using a finger to remove stool from your bottom. Some causes of constipation include: Changes to what you eat or your activities Not enough water or fiber in your diet Eating a lot of dairy products Not being active Resisting the urge to poop Stress Overuse of laxatives Some medications (especially strong pain drugs such as narcotics, antidepressants, and iron pills) Antacid medicines that have calcium or aluminum Eating disorders Irritable bowel syndrome Pregnancy Problems with the nerves and muscles in your digestive system Colon cancer Neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis Underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism) Take these steps: Drink two to four extra glasses of water a day, unless your doctor told you to limit fluids for another reason. Try warm liquids, especially in the morning. Add fruits and vegetables to your diet. Eat prunes and bran cereal. Exercise most days of the week. When you move your body, the muscles in your intestines are more active, too. Don't ignore the urge to poop. You can try taking a laxative, too. There are several types of laxatives, and you can buy many of them over the counter. Each of them works in a different way to ease constipation. Ask your doctor or pharmacist which kind might work for you and how long you should take it. Call your doctor right away if you have sudden constipation with belly pain or cramping and you aren't able to poop or pass gas at all. Also, make the call if: Constipation is a new problem for you, and lifestyle changes haven't helped. You have blood in your stool. You're losing weight even though you're not trying to. You have severe pain with bowel movements. Your constipation has lasted more than 2 weeks. The size, shape, and consistency of your stool has changed dramatically. Your doctor may recommend some tests to find the cause of your constipation: Blood tests to check on hormone levels Tests that check the muscles in your anus Tests that show how waste moves through and out of your colon Colonoscopy to look for blockages in your colon In many cases, you can. These things can help: Eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of fiber. Good sources are fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole-grain bread and cereal (especially bran). Drink 1 1/2 to 2 quarts of water and other fluids a day (unless your doctor has you on a fluid-restricted diet). Fiber and water work together to keep you regular. Avoid caffeine. It can be dehydrating. Cut back on milk. Dairy products can constipate some people. Exercise regularly. Do something active for at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. Go to the bathroom when you feel the urge."
94,"If your blood sugar is too high for too long, it can cause serious health problems. It's something to be careful of whether you have diabetes or not. How high is too high? Your doctor will tell you what your target range should be and what to do if your levels aren't in that range. If you have diabetes, you'll need to check your blood sugar, also called glucose, to know if it's too high, too low, or meets your goal. The problems that high blood sugar can cause happen over time. The sooner you get your levels back in line, the better. The symptoms can include: Feeling thirstier than usual Blurred vision Having to pee more often Feeling hungrier than normal Numb or tingling feet You might also feel more tired than usual, get infections on your skin, or notice that cuts and sores take a long time to heal. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. High glucose levels can affect you from head to toe. If they're out of control for a long time, you could have some or all of the following: Heart disease or heart attack Stroke Kidney damage Nerve damage Eye damage Skin problems Pick up the phone if your blood sugar is high and you have any of these symptoms: Trouble breathing Vomiting High levels of ketones in your urine Extreme thirst or a very dry mouth Having to pee too often Dry or flushed skin Breath that smells like fruit Confusion These are symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). Your body burns glucose for energy. When your cells don't get enough of it, they burn fat. That produces chemicals called ketones. When these build up, your blood becomes more acid-like. This can be life-threatening if it's not treated. This mostly affects elderly people. As glucose builds up in your blood, your body tries to get rid of it through your urine. At first, you pee a lot. Over time, you pee less, but when you do, it's very dark. This condition can lead to dehydration, coma, and death. Get medical help right away if you have any of these warning signs: Blood sugar level over 600 mg/d L Extreme thirst that may later go away Warm, dry skin that doesn't sweat Fever over 101 F Sleepiness or confusion Weakness on one side of your body Vision loss Hallucinations You can avoid many of these problems by keeping your blood sugar under control. Follow your doctor's advice about diet and exercise, take your medicine, keep up with your doctor visits, and check your levels often."
95,"Eating healthy supports all your body's systems. Your eyes are no exception -- they need vitamins and minerals to ease your chance of having problems and protect your vision. If you're looking to boost your eye health and help your dry eye symptoms, focus on these key nutrients. Filling up on these can ease the scratchy, stinging irritation of dry eye. Specifically, omega-3s help soothe inflammation in your eyelids or on the surface of your eye. They may also help your tears do their job better. An omega-3-rich diet helps glands in your eye called meibomian glands make the oily part of your tears. The oil helps keep your tears from drying up too quickly in your eye. Fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids. Go for one of these oily varieties at least twice a week: Tuna (fresh, not canned) Mackerel Salmon Sardines Herring Anchovies You can also get omega-3 fatty acids from: Nuts and seeds (like flaxseed) Vegetable oil Soybeans Green, leafy vegetables You may also need to take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement. Talk to your doctor about it before you try one. These two antioxidants cut your odds of having many chronic eye diseases. Among other things, they help keep the cells in your eye healthy and working well. You can get them by eating eggs, corn, and leafy greens like: Kale Broccoli Spinach Collards A supplement may help here, too. Still, talk to your doctor before you take one. This antioxidant, also called ascorbic acid, is important for the blood vessels in your eyes. It's especially helpful in preventing cataracts, but it helps your overall eye health, too. Best sources of vitamin C include: Orange juice Grapefruit juice Oranges Cooked spinach Tomatoes Bananas Apples Women should aim for a minimum of 75 milligrams a day, which is about a cup of orange juice. Men need a little more -- around 90 milligrams a day. The antioxidant power of this nutrient protects the cells in your eyes from damage. It also boosts your body's immune system. You can get it by eating: Wheat cereal (wheat germ) Almonds Sunflower seeds Peanut butter Hazelnuts Sweet potato This is an important mineral that helps get vitamin A from your liver to your retina to make something called melanin. That's a pigment that protects your eyes. When you don't get enough zinc, your eyes are at a higher risk of infection. Your body doesn't make zinc naturally, so getting it through food is important. You can get a zinc boost from foods like: Oysters Beef Lobster Pork Yogurt Salmon Milk Fortified cereals Eggs"
96,"Several conditions are associated with chronic hepatitis C. Their occurrence does not correlate with the severity of the underlying liver disease. Some of the conditions are discussed below. Cryoglobulinemia and Hepatitis C The most widely described associated condition is cryoglobulinemia. This condition is due to the presence of abnormal antibodies (called cryoglobulins) that come from hepatitis C virus stimulation of lymphocytes (white blood cells). These antibodies can deposit in small blood vessels, thereby causing inflammation of the vessels (vasculitis) in tissues throughout the body including the skin, joints, and kidneys (glomerulonephritis). Some people with cryoglobulinemia have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include: Weakness Joint pain or swelling (arthralgia or arthritis) A raised, purple skin rash (palpable purpura) usually in the lower portion of the legs Swelling of the legs and feet due to loss of protein in the urine from the kidney involvement Nerve pain (neuropathy) In addition, people with cryoglobulinemia may develop Raynaud's phenomenon, in which the fingers and toes turn color (white, then purple, then red) and become painful in cold temperatures. The diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia is made by doing a special test in the laboratory to detect the cryoglobulins in the blood. In this test, the cryoglobulins are identified when the blood sample is exposed to the cold (cryo means cold). In addition, a finding of typical inflammation of small blood vessels in certain tissue biopsies (for example, the skin or kidney) supports the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. Symptoms of cryoglobulinemia often resolve with successful treatment of the hepatitis C virus infection. B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hepatitis C B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph tissue, has also been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. The cause is thought to be the excessive stimulation by the hepatitis C virus of B-lymphocytes, which results in the abnormal reproduction of the lymphocytes. Interestingly, treatment with interferon therapy and some newer direct-acting antiviral treatments have caused some cases of hepatitis C virus-associated low-grade (not very active) non- Hodgkin's lymphoma to go into remission. However, most individuals with hepatitis C virus-associated high-grade non- Hodgkin's lymphoma will require the usual anti-cancer therapies. Skin and Arthritis Conditions and Hepatitis C Two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda, have been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. Porphyria cutanea tarda may resolve with successful interferon therapy for the hepatitis C virus. There have been cases, however, where lichen planus actually worsened during interferon treatment. In addition, many hepatitis C virus patients have autoimmune antibodies, such as anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. But true rheumatoid arthritis is uncommon in people with hepatitis C virus. Diabetes and Hepatitis C Chronic hepatitis C is also associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance."
97,"A seizure originating in the temporal lobe of the brain may be preceded by an aura or warning symptom, such as: Abnormal sensations (which may include a rising or ""funny"" feeling under your breast bone or in the area of your stomach) Hallucinations (including sights, smells, tastes) Vivid deja vu (a sense of familiarity) or recalled memories or emotions A sudden, intense emotion not related to anything happening at the time During the seizure, a person may experience motor disturbances, sensory symptoms, or autonomic symptoms. Motor or movement disturbances (called automatisms) may include the following: Rhythmic muscle contractions on one side of the body or face Abnormal mouth behaviors (lip smacking, chewing for no reason, slobbering) Abnormal head movements (forced turning of the head or eyes) Repetitive movements (such as picking at clothing) Other sensory symptoms may include the following sensations that start in one area and spread: Numbness Tingling A feeling that the flesh is crawling Autonomic symptoms may include the following: Abdominal pain or nausea Sweating, flushing, dilated pupils, or rapid heartbeat Depending on whether the person remains conscious, he or she may not remember having had a seizure at all. A period of confusion frequently follows seizures and can last several minutes."
98,"Experts say eating healthy is an important way to protect yourself from cancer. When you put the right kinds of foods -- and the right portions -- into your body, you fuel your cells with the nutrients they need to stay healthy. You'll also avoid unhealthy ingredients that could make you sick. People who eat more fruits and veggies tend to get less cancer. That may be because those foods are high in antioxidants -- chemicals that fight the cell damage that leads to cancer. You can find antioxidants in fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and other plant-based foods, as well as in supplements. But research suggests that getting them from food works better than getting them from pills. Some supplements may raise your risk of getting cancer. Aim for at least 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables every day, and try to eat a variety of types and colors. Your produce doesn't have to all come straight from the farmers market, either. Canned or frozen fruits and veggies have many of the same nutrients as fresh ones. You can also add garlic to your shopping list. This flavorful ingredient may protect against several types of cancer. If you eat a lot of fat, sugar, and refined carbs (like white bread), you're more likely to gain weight and become obese. It's even more likely if you don't do enough to burn off the extra calories. Obesity is linked to several types of cancer, so it's smart to follow an eating plan that helps you keep your weight as low as you can without being underweight. Cancer experts say it's key to avoid high-calorie processed foods and sugary beverages like soda, sweet tea, and juice-flavored drinks. They have lots of calories but won't help you feel full. Alcohol is also tied to several types of cancer. All types -- beer, wine, and spirits -- seem to raise your chances. Drink in moderate amounts. That means no more than one drink a day for women, and no more than two for men. Experts have figured out what foods are best to eat -- or skip -- for specific types of cancer. Here's the list: Breast cancer: People who eat lots of veggies, fruit, poultry, fish, and low-fat dairy products have lower rates of this type of cancer. There's strong evidence that alcohol boosts your chances of getting it. Even a few drinks a week can make it more likely. If you're worried, just say no. Colorectal cancer: If you have a spare tire, you're more likely to get this cancer. Do you eat lots of red or processed meat? That can also play a role. So can chemicals called nitrates, which are often added to lunch meat, ham, hot dogs, and bacon. You should also cut back on meats that are fried, broiled, or grilled over an open flame. When animal products cook at high temperatures, they form chemicals that cause cancer. Make sure any meat you eat doesn't burn, and skip the blackened or charred parts. To lower your risk, eat foods with fiber, especially whole grains. Calcium and vitamin D may also protect you. But be careful: Too much could raise your odds for getting other types of cancer. Stick to the recommended levels. Uterine cancer: Extra belly fat can make you more likely to get this type. It could be that overweight women make more estrogen, which often fuels cancer growth. Stick to a diet and exercise plan that helps you lose extra belly fat and keep it away. Lung cancer: Smoking is the biggest risk factor here. But many studies show that people who eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day are less likely to get it than those who don't. Digestive cancers: Obesity often brings on acid reflux, which boosts your chances of cancer in the esophagus and stomach. A healthy weight can keep your risk low. Avoid beverages and foods that are hot enough to burn you. They can damage cells in your mouth, throat, and esophagus and may raise your chances of getting one of these cancers. Salty food has been linked to higher odds of stomach cancer. Processed meat could also make it more likely. Ovarian cancer: Soybeans or foods made with soy (like tofu) could lower your odds of getting ovarian cancer. Tea, especially green tea, may also keep it at bay. But not all research supports these findings. The jury is still out on how much they help. Pancreatic cancer: Belly fat is linked to a higher risk of this type, especially for women. A diet high in red and processed meat could also play a role. Limit these foods, and slim down if you're overweight. Prostate cancer: If you're a man, chowing down on tomatoes, soy, beans, and other legumes could lower your prostate cancer risk. Add cruciferous veggies -- broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage -- to the mix, too. Several studies have linked high levels of calcium, or large amounts of dairy foods, to higher odds of prostate cancer. Don't take calcium unless your doctor recommends it."
99,"There are several skin lesions that are very common and benign (non-cancerous). These conditions include moles, freckles, skin tags, benign lentigines, and seborrheic keratoses.  Moles are growths on the skin that are usually brown or black. Moles can appear anywhere on the skin, alone or in groups. Most moles appear in early childhood and during the first 25 years of a person's life. It is normal to have between 10-40 moles by adulthood. As the years pass, moles usually change slowly, becoming raised and/or changing color. Sometimes, hairs develop in the mole. Some moles may not change at all, while others may slowly disappear over time. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people. These moles are slightly more likely to develop into melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below). Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Any changes in a mole should be checked by a dermatologist to evaluate for skin cancer. The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 25. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, or become tender or painful. Examine your skin with a mirror or ask someone to help you. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that are often exposed to the sun, such as the hands, arms, chest, neck, face, ears, legs, and back. If a mole does not change over time, there is little reason for concern. If you see any signs of change in an existing mole, if you have a new mole, or if you want a mole to be removed for cosmetic reasons, talk to your dermatologist. The following ABCDEs are important characteristics to consider when examining moles. If a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked immediately by a dermatologist. It could be cancerous. Asymmetry. One half of the mole does not match the other half. Border. The border or edges of the mole are ragged, blurred, or irregular. Color. The color of the mole is not the same throughout or has shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red. Diameter. The diameter of a mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil. Evolution. The mole is changing in size, shape, or color. Melanoma is a form of skin cancer. The most common location for melanoma in men is the chest and back and in women, it is the lower leg. Melanoma is the most common cancer in young women. If a dermatologist believes a mole needs to be evaluated further, he or she will do a biopsy by shaving or cutting out the entire spot so that it can be evaluated under the microscope. This is a simple procedure. ( If the dermatologist thinks the mole might be cancerous, cutting through the mole will not cause the cancer to spread.) If the mole is found to be cancerous, the dermatologist will cut out the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area and a rim of normal skin around it, and stitching the wound closed. A skin tag is a small flap of tissue that hangs off the skin by a connecting stalk. Skin tags are not dangerous. They are usually found on the neck, chest, back, armpits, under the breasts, or in the groin area. Skin tags appear most often in women, especially with weight gain, and in elderly people. Skin tags usually don't cause any pain. However, they can become irritated if anything, such as clothing, jewelry, or skin rubs against them. Your dermatologist can remove a skin tag by cutting it off with a scalpel or scissors, with cryosurgery (freezing it off), or with electrosurgery (burning it off with an electric current). A lentigo (plural: lentigines) is a spot on the skin that is darker (usually brown) than the surrounding skin. Lentigines are more common among whites, especially those with fair skin. Exposure to the sun seems to be the major cause of lentigines. Lentigines most often appear on parts of the body that get the most sun, including the face and hands. Some lentigines may be caused by genetics (family history) or by medical procedures such as radiation therapy. There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing it off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid using tanning beds. Freckles are small brown spots usually found on the face, neck, chest, and arms. Freckles are extremely common and are not a health threat. They are more often seen in the summer, especially among lighter-skinned people and people with light or red hair. Causes of freckles include genetics and exposure to the sun. Since freckles are almost always harmless, there is no need to treat them. As with many skin conditions, it's best to avoid the sun as much as possible, or use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30. This is especially important because people who freckle easily (for example, lighter-skinned people) are more likely to develop skin cancer. If you feel that your freckles are a problem or you don't like the way they look, you can cover them up with makeup or consider certain types of laser treatment, liquid nitrogen treatment or chemical peels. Seborrheic keratoses are brown or black growths usually found on the chest and back, as well as on the head. They originate from cells called keratinocytes. As they develop, seborrheic keratoses take on a warty appearance. They do not normally lead to skin cancer. The cause of seborrheic keratoses is unknown. They are seen more often as people get older. Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and are not contagious. Therefore, they don't need to be treated. If you decide to have seborrheic keratoses removed because you don't like the way they look, or because they are chronically irritated by clothing, methods for removing them include cutting them off, cryosurgery, and electrosurgery."
100,"A doctor may prescribe eye exercises if you have: Trouble focusing your eyes to read One eye that drifts outward or inward Had surgery and need to strengthen muscle control Strabismus, or crossed eyes Amblyopia, or ''lazy eye'' Double vision Binocular vision problems (poor 3 D vision) Doctors may recommend eye exercises for conditions involving how the eyes work together, such as convergence insufficiency, that may cause problems such as: Blurred vision Eyestrain Increased light sensitivity They won't help if you: Have dyslexia Blink a lot Squint Have eye spasms Have a paralyzed eye muscle The doctor may give your child exercises to do if he has lazy eye, a loss of vision in one eye because he uses the other more. The condition usually starts in childhood. First your child will get eyeglasses, if he needs them. Then the doctor will put a patch over his good eye, or use eye drops to blur vision in it, so he has to rely more on the lazy eye. Vision therapy exercises can also force the brain to see through the weaker eye, which helps restore vision. They're designed to strengthen your eye muscles, help you focus, ease eye movements, and stimulate your brain's vision center. As you do them and progress to new ones, you'll learn how to control your eye muscles and see properly. What you do will be unique for you, based on your age and other eye problems. You might be asked to: Change focus from near to far and back again. Cover one eye and look at different objects. Concentrate on a solitary object. Follow a pattern to build vision muscles."
101,"Major pharmaceutical companies continually research and develop new cancer drugs and treatments, which must be shown to be safe and effective before they are FDA approved for use and doctors can prescribe them to patients. Through lymphoma clinical trials, researchers test the effects of new medications or treatment regimens on a group of volunteers with lymphoma. Following a strict protocol and using carefully controlled conditions, researchers evaluate the drugs under development and measure the ability of the new drug to treat lymphoma, its safety, and any possible side effects. Some patients with lymphoma are reluctant to take part in clinical trials for fear of getting no treatment at all for their lymphoma. This is simply not true. Patients with lymphoma who participate in lymphoma clinical trials receive the most effective therapy currently available for their condition -- or they may receive lymphoma treatments that are being evaluated for future use. These lymphoma treatments may be even more effective than currently available lymphoma treatments. The following web sites offer information and services to help you find a lymphoma clinical trial that may be right for you. American Cancer Society This website provides detailed information, videos, and links to clinical trial matching services. You can also use their helpline 1-800-227-2345 to speak to a cancer information specialist anytime.

102,"Paragonimiasis is an infection with parasitic worms. It is caused by eating undercooked crab or crayfish. Paragonimiasis can cause illness resembling pneumonia or stomach flu. The infection can last for years. Paragonimiasis is caused by infection with a flatworm. That's a parasitic worm also called a fluke or lung fluke because it commonly infects the lungs. Usually, infection comes after eating undercooked crab or crayfish that carry immature flukes. Once swallowed by a person, the worms mature and grow inside the body. Over months, the worms spread through the intestines and belly (abdomen). They penetrate the diaphragm muscle to enter the lungs. Once inside the lungs, the worms lay eggs and can survive for years, causing chronic (long-term) paragonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is rare in the U. S. Most cases occur in Asia, West Africa, and South and Central America. Paragonimiasis causes no symptoms during initial infection. Many people with paragonimiasis never experience any symptoms. When paragonimiasis symptoms do occur, they result from the worms' location and activity in the body, which change over time. In the first month or so after someone is infected, paragonimiasis worms spread through the abdomen, sometimes causing symptoms that can include: Fever Ill-feeling (malaise) Diarrhea Belly pain Itching and hives Worms then travel from the belly into the chest. There they can cause respiratory symptoms, such as: Cough Shortness of breath Chest pain (made worse by deep breathing or coughing) Without treatment, paragonimiasis becomes chronic. It can continue for decades. The most common long-term paragonimiasis symptom is a cough with bloody sputum (hemoptysis) that comes and goes. Other chronic paragonimiasis symptoms may include: Belly pain Nausea Vomiting Bloody diarrhea Lumps or bumps on the skin of the belly or legs that come and go over time Some people with chronic paragonimiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Inup to 25% of people hospitalized with paragonimiasis, the worms infect the brain. Symptoms can include: Headache Fever Vomiting Double vision Seizures Diagnosing paragonimiasis can be difficult or delayed. That's because its symptoms are often mild and overlap with more common conditions. Most often, a person with symptoms has multiple tests before a doctor makes the diagnosis of paragonimiasis. Exams and tests used to make a diagnosis include: Patient History. Your doctor will get clues about possible paragonimiasis by looking at the pattern in which your symptoms appeared. Your doctor will ask about your past eating of undercooked crab or crayfish. Physical examination. Abnormal breath sounds or belly tenderness observed with a doctor's examination of the chest or belly can suggest a problem and direct further testing. Blood tests. A high number of a specific type of white blood cells can suggest parasitic infection. Antibodies against flukes may be present in the blood. Sputum microscopy. Fluke eggs may be detected during examination of coughed-up sputum under a microscope. Chest X-ray. Nodules (spots) in the lungs, hollowed-out areas (cysts or cavities), or fluid around the lungs (pleural effusions) may be present. CT scan. High-resolution images of the lungs may show more detailed information than a chest X-ray. Also, CT of the head or abdomen may be abnormal if paragonimiasis involves the brain or liver. MRI. Very high-definition images of the brain can identify cysts or brain swelling caused by paragonimiasis. Bronchoscopy . A doctor can put an endoscope (flexible tube with a camera on its tip) through the nose or mouth into the lungs. Flukes or their eggs are collected from lung fluid samples. The flukes or eggs may be seen under a microscope. Thoracentesis. A doctor puts a needle through the chest wall to sample fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion). Stool studies. Fluke eggs may be seen in stool samples when examined under a microscope. A definite diagnosis of paragonimiasis is made when fluke eggs are detected in an infected person's sputum or stool. But the flukes may not lay eggs until two months after you are infected. That makes early diagnosis difficult. In most people, paragonimiasis can be cured with oral anti-parasite medications. Both praziquantel ( Biltricide) and triclabendazole ( Egaten) are approved for treatment. Praziquantel is taken three times daily for two days, while triclabendazole is taken twice a day, 12 hours apart. In the rare cases of paragonimiasis with brain involvement, other treatments may be necessary, such as anti-seizure medications or surgery to reduce brain swelling."
103,"People with multiple sclerosis ( MS) tend to have their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40. Usually the symptoms get better, but then they come back. Some come and go, while others linger. No two people have exactly the same symptoms. You may have a single symptom, and then go months or years without any others. A problem can also happen just one time, go away, and never return. For some people, the symptoms get worse within weeks or months. Keep track of what's happening to you. It'll help your doctor monitor your disease and help her understand how well your treatment works. See More: A Visual Guide to Multiple Sclerosis For many people, the first brush with what's later diagnosed as MS is what doctors call clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS). This episode of neurological symptoms usually lasts 24 hours. It happens when your immune system mistakenly tells your body to attack myelin, the protective sheath over nerve cells in your brain and spine. You may hear your doctor call this demyelination. It causes scars, or lesions, that make it harder for signals to travel between your brain and your body. There are two types of CIS: Monofocal episode: You have one symptom. Multifocal episode: You have more than one symptom. The most common symptoms in CIS are: Optic neuritis: This condition damages the nerve that connects your eye to your brain. It usually affects just one eye, but in rare cases, it involves both. You might notice: Blurry vision Colors appear dull Pain in your eye, especially when you move it Numbness & Tingling: It usually affects your legs. You might feel: An electric shock-like feeling when you move your head or neck. It may travel down your spine or into your arms or legs. Numbness, often in your face Tingling Not everyone who has CIS will get MS. The odds are higher if you have lesions in your brain from loss of myelin. If you have another CIS or other MS symptoms later, your doctor will do a test called an MRI that takes a picture of your brain to look for them. These come from ongoing damage to your myelin. They aren't pleasant, but your MS treatment team can help you keep most of them under control with medication, rehabilitation, and other tactics. The most common symptoms are: Bladder and bowel problems: You may have to pee more often, need to go at night, or have trouble emptying your bladder fully. Bowel issues like constipation are also common. Clumsiness or lack of coordination: MS can make it hard to get around. You might have: Trouble walking A hard time keeping your balance Changes in your gait Dizziness: You may feel lightheaded. You probably won't have vertigo, that feeling that the room is spinning. Emotional changes and depression: It's tough to adjust to the idea that you have a chronic disease, let alone one that's hard to predict and that will take a physical toll. Fear of the unknown can make you anxious. Plus the disease damages nerve fibers in your brain, and that can affect your emotions. So can medications, like corticosteroids, used to treat MS. Eye problems: In addition to the optic neuritis that comes with CIS, MS can cause: Nystagmus: involuntary eye movements Diplopia: double vision Fatigue: You may feel very tired. It often comes on in the afternoon and causes weak muscles, slowed thinking, or sleepiness. It isn't usually related to the amount of work you do. Some people with MS say they can feel tired even after a good night's sleep. Heat-related problems: You might notice them as you warm up during exercise. You could feel tired and weak or have trouble controlling certain body parts, like your foot or leg. As you rest and cool down, these symptoms are likely to go away. Muscle spasms : They usually affect your leg muscles. They're an early symptom for almost half the people with MS. They also affect people with progressive MS. You might feel mild stiffness or strong, painful spasms. Sexual troubles: These include vaginal dryness in women and erection problems in men. Both men and women may be less responsive to touch, have a lower sex drive, or have trouble reaching orgasm. Speech problems: MS could cause long pauses between your words and slurred or nasal speech. You might have swallowing problems as the disease advances. Thinking problems: It might be hard to focus from time to time. This will probably mean slowed thinking, poor attention, or fuzzy memory. Some people have severe problems that make it hard to do daily tasks, but that's rare. MS doesn't usually change your intellect or ability to read and understand conversation. Tremors: About half of people with MS have them. They can be minor shakes or so intense it's hard to do everyday activities. Trouble walking: MS can cause muscle weakness or spasms, which make it tough to walk. Balance problems, numb feet, and fatigue can also happen. Unusual sensations: In addition to the pins and needles sensation that's part of CIS, you might also have severe itching, burning, stabbing, or tearing pains. You could feel a tightness around your ribs or upper belly known as the MS hug. Doctors call these uncomfortable symptoms dysesthesia. These are problems created by your primary MS symptoms, not by damaged myelin. Not being able to empty your bladder can lead to a bladder infection. If you have trouble walking and are often fatigued, you're likely to become less active. That can take a toll on your muscle tone, make your breathing shallow, and even affect your bone density. Doctors can treat secondary symptoms, but the goal is to avoid them by treating the primary symptoms. These are the social, psychological, and job-related problems of life with MS. If MS makes it hard for you to walk or drive, you may not be able to do your job well. Because it's tough to get around and hard to talk to people about what life with a chronic disease is like, you may not be as social as you once were. You could get depressed. It's a byproduct of the changes MS makes in your brain and in your life. Because MS varies so much, it's best not to compare yourself with other people who have it. Your experience is likely to be different. Most people learn to manage their symptoms and can keep leading full, active lives."
104,"People with early stomach cancer don't usually have any symptoms. If there are symptoms, they are typically vague. These can include: Indigestion and stomach discomfort A bloated feeling after eating Mild nausea Loss of appetite Heartburn Peptic ulcers and acid reflux (also called GERD) cause similar symptoms. Antacids or histamine blockers may give temporary relief. Many other conditions can cause these symptoms as well. For these reasons, people may not recognize the problem as serious and may put off seeing a doctor. A gastric tumor can grow very large before it causes other symptoms. In more advanced stages, symptoms of stomach cancer can include: Discomfort or pain in the upper or middle part of the abdomen Blood in the stool, which appears as black, tarry stools Vomiting or vomiting blood, which may look like coffee grounds Trouble swallowing Weight loss Pain or bloating in the stomach after eating Feeling of fullness after eating a small amount Weakness or fatigue associated with anemia A buildup of fluid in the abdomen called ascites"
105,"Prophylaxis is a treatment that helps you prevent an infection from bacteria, fungus, a virus, or a parasite either before you come in contact with the bug or after you've been exposed.. Post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, means you take it after you may have come into contact with one of those bugs. If you've been exposed to HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), PEP is a course of two or three drugs that will make you less likely to be infected. With the right treatment, there's about an 80% chance the virus will be stopped. But you have to take the full course of drugs, and not everyone follows through. Only 57% of people who start the treatment typically finish it. This may be because you have to take the medication for 28 days, and it can cause side effects. It also can be expensive. PEP may help: People who think they might have been exposed to HIV during sex Drug users who have recently shared needles or other related items Health-care workers who think they've been exposed to HIV on the job If you think you have been exposed to HIV, a health care provider will help determine whether you need PEP. You should seek health care as soon as possible after such an exposure. PEP is for emergency situations only. It should not be used as a substitute for safe sex or new sterile needles. If you're frequently exposed to HIV -- because of contact with multiple sex partners or injecting drug use, for example -- talk with your doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis ( Pr EP) instead. PEP uses more drugs than Pr EP and is used for only one month.. You have to start PEP within 72 hours of exposure. After that, the treatment won't work. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, get medical attention as soon as possible. The idea behind PEP is that the same drugs that treat HIV can help you fight the virus as it tries to infect you. These drugs are called antiretrovirals. That involves a combination of three drugs. The medications used in this way keep HIV from establishing itself in your body You'll take them once or twice a day for 28 days: For adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) recommends a drug called tenofovir, combined with emtricitabine(these two drugs are combined in one pill), and a third drug, either raltegravir or dolutegravir. Women in early pregnancy, or who are sexually active and could become pregnant while taking PEP, or women who were victims of sexual assault should not take dolutegravir as part of PEP. Raltegravir should be used instead. Children who need PEP, down to the age of 2, get the same drugs, but adjusted for their weight If you're on PEP, use condoms if you have sex to lower the chances that you'll be exposed to HIV again or that you'll pass the virus to others if you are infected. You might have nausea or fatigue with PEP. The drugs also can cause headache, insomnia, and diarrhea. In rare cases, they can cause serious health issues, including liver problems. If you are prescribed PEP, your doctor will take blood specimens at the time you start and may want to get other tests, such as for sexually-transmitted diseases besides HIV. Follow-up testing will be needed to see if you have become infected with HIV. It's possible that if the treatment doesn't work and you become infected with HIV, the virus may be resistant to some of the HIV drugs."
106,"Many different conditions can cause chronic pelvic pain. You may have one or more of them. All can have similar symptoms, and that often makes it hard to figure out the source of the pain. The main symptom is pain that lasts for more than six months, but there are usually other symptoms, as well. Understanding your symptoms can help you and your doctor begin to pinpoint the cause or causes of your chronic pelvic pain. Here are some of the causes and the related symptoms: In endometriosis, cells that normally line the inside of the uterus (the endometrium) grow inappropriately outside on organs such as the ovaries, bladder, or rectum. Symptoms you may have: Pelvic pain or cramps before or during your period Pain during or after sex Pain when you ovulate Painful bowel movements Rectal bleeding during your period Pain when you urinate Lower back pain Infertility Spotting between periods Bloating in your abdomen This condition is similar to endometriosis. Cells that normally line your uterus (the endometrium) invade the muscle tissue of the uterus wall (the myometrium). Many women with adenomyosis don't have any symptoms. Symptoms you may have: Pain during your period Feeling of pressure on your bladder or rectum Heavy periods Periods that last longer than usual Spotting between periods Women with interstitial cystitis have an inflamed bladder. The inflammation is not caused by an infection. This condition tends to affect women in their 30s and 40s. Symptoms you may have: You need to urinate very often Often feeling an urgent need to urinate Discomfort when you urinate Pain during sex Bacteria are usually the cause of urinary tract infections. Infections can involve any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Urinary tract infections are much more common in women than in men. Symptoms you may have: Feeling pressure in your lower pelvis Pain or a burning sensation when you urinate Needing to urinate often Often feeling an urgent need to urinate Needing to get up at night to urinate Cloudy urine Blood in urine Urine has strong or bad smell Only a trickle of urine comes out Lower back pain This is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries that causes them to become inflamed and infected. Most often, it is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection, like gonorrhea or chlamydia. These bacteria enter the uterus through the vagina and leave the fallopian tubes to infect surrounding organs like the ovaries. Scars left by the infection may cause chronic pelvic pain; however, more commonly the pain is acute. Symptoms you may have: Vaginal discharge having an unusual color, texture, or odor Abdominal or pelvic pain in a specific area or more widespread Pain during sex Irregular or missed periods Menstrual cramps that are worse than usual Frequent need to urinate Pain when you urinate Pain when you ovulate It hurts when you press on certain areas of your pelvis Lower back pain Fatigue Fever Nausea Pelvic congestion is just like the varicose veins that some women have in their legs, but it affects the veins of the pelvis. Blood backs up in the veins, making them become enlarged and engorged. Pelvic congestion causes chronic pelvic pain in some women. Symptoms you may have: Pain starts 7-10 days before your period Pelvic pain is worse when you sit or stand Lying down relieves pelvic pain Lower back pain Aches in your legs Pain during sex Chronic pelvic pain sometimes isn't only due to problems with reproductive organs or the urinary tract; other organs in the pelvic area, if ""diseased,"" can present as pelvic pain. Irritable bowel syndrome, an intestinal condition that often causes pain, may be the cause. Symptoms you may have: Diarrhea Constipation Incontinence Flatulence Bloating Pain relieved by a bowel movement Fibroids are noncancerous tumors that grow in, and on, the wall of the uterus. Not all women who have them notice symptoms, but for some, fibroids can be painful. Symptoms you may have: Heavy periods Feeling pressure or fullness in your abdomen Need to urinate frequently Pain or cramps during your period Constipation Hemorrhoids Sometimes, spasms of a pelvic muscle called the ""levator ani"" cause pelvic pain. Symptoms you may have: Pain is related to sitting Pain doesn't seem to be related to bowel movements You wake up at night in pain Pain usually lasts less than 20 minutes at a time Sometimes women have pelvic pain when the muscles and ligaments that hold organs in place weaken. This causes organs like the uterus, the bladder, or the rectum to move from their normal places and herniate into the vagina. The vagina may also change shape. Pregnancy and giving birth may cause these kinds of problems. Symptoms you may have: Leaking urine Feeling like something is falling out of your vagina Difficulty with bowel movements Lower back pain Pain during sex Pelvic organs bulge into the vagina, or even stick out the vaginal opening, in severe cases Vulvodynia is pain that affects the vulva for no apparent reason. The pain of vulvodynia may be constant or it may come and go. Symptoms you may have: Burning or stinging sensations in the vulva Pain when something presses on the vulva, like during sex or when you straddle a seat Pain in your inner thighs For some women, the root of pelvic pain is psychological. That's not to say that the pain isn't real. There just isn't an identifiable physical cause. Some people have emotional problems that only show up as physical symptoms. Women who have suffered sexual abuse or assault often have chronic pelvic pain afterward. Symptoms you may have: Depression Anxiety Substance abuse Stress"
107,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST) affect more than the people who are diagnosed with them. This rare GI tract cancer can have an impact on family members, friends, and caregivers, too. During treatment for GIST, family and friends may have to help out with day-to-day responsibilities. If you find yourself caring for someone with GIST, you may not think of yourself as a ""caregiver."" However, if you're cooking meals, shopping, helping with dressing and bathing, and offering emotional support, you are considered a caregiver. Caregiving can be a difficult and consuming job. It is easy to become isolated, and to forget about your own needs, when you're spending so much time doing things for your loved one. The following resources offer caregivers a variety of supportive resources. You must remember to maintain your own health while taking care of someone else. The Caregiver's Job When caring for someone with GIST -- or any other cancer -- several responsibilities may fall to you, including: Cooking and cleaning Running errands Helping the person get bathed, dressed, and take medicine Managing insurance issues and bills Driving to the doctor's office and other appointment When you take the person with GIST to the doctor, here are a few questions to ask so you'll know what's expected of you: Where can I learn more about GIST and its treatment? What are the next steps in treatment? What medicines does he or she need to take? How do I give those medicines? What side effects might the treatment cause? For which side effects should I call you? How can I help my family member/friend with GIST feel better during treatment? What can I do to help manage his or her pain? Are there any local support groups or resources I should know about? Help for the Caregiver To make sure you don't burn out while caregiving: Take breaks. Set aside some time each day for you, Get out of the house regularly so as not to feel isolated and lonely. Say ""no"" when you need to, and ask for help. There are times when you can't do everything. Hire or enlist outside help if possible. The resources listed below can help point you in the right direction. Join a caregiver support group. Meeting with a group of people who are also caring for someone with a soft tissue sarcoma, or other disease, can make you feel less alone. At the support group, you can exchange ideas with other people, meet other caregivers, and learn tips to make caregiving tasks easier. Group support is an effective tool to help you cope more effectively. Take care of yourself. The person with GIST isn't the only one who needs a little TLC right now. You can't be an effective caregiver if you're not well. Ensure that your health and well-being are maintained. GIST Resources Here are a few resources to help in caring for the individual with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Ask your doctor for more information on local support groups. American Cancer Society www.cancer.org Cancer Care www.cancercare.org Family Caregiver Alliance www.caregiver.org GIST Support International ( GSI) www.gistsupport.org Life Raft Group www.liferaftgroup.org National Cancer Institute www.cancer.gov National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) www.nccn.com National Family Caregivers Association www.nfcacares.org"
108,"Fabry disease runs in families. It can have lots of different symptoms, including pain in the hands and feet and a specific kind of rash. When you have Fabry disease, a certain type of fatty substance builds up in your body. It narrows your blood vessels, which can hurt your skin, kidneys, heart, brain, and nervous system. Your doctor may call Fabry disease a ""storage disorder."" It usually starts in childhood and is much more common in men than women. There are treatments that can make a difference in how you feel, day-to-day. Getting support from your family and friends is key, too. You get Fabry disease from your parents. It's passed down through genes. The problem is that your body can't make an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A, which you need to break down fatty substances like oils, waxes, and fatty acids. When you have Fabry disease, you either were born without that enzyme or it doesn't work right. You may notice things like: Pain and burning in your hands and feet that get worse with exercise, fever, and hot weather or when you are tired Small, dark red spots usually found between your belly button and knees Cloudy vision Hearing loss Ringing in the ears Sweating less than normal Stomach pain, bowel movements right after eating Fabry disease can lead to more serious problems, especially in men. These can include: Higher chance of heart attack or stroke Serious kidney problems, including kidney failure High blood pressure Heart failure Enlarged heart Osteoporosis It can take a long time to get diagnosed with Fabry disease. That's because the symptoms are common and can affect so many different parts of the body. Many people who have Fabry disease don't get diagnosed until years after they first had symptoms. They have often seen several different doctors for various symptoms and sometimes get the wrong diagnosis. If your family history suggests you could be at risk for Fabry disease, you may want to ask your doctor about getting genetic testing. When you see your doctor, he will do a physical exam and ask you questions like these: How are you feeling? What's concerning you? What symptoms have you noticed? When did those symptoms start? What medical conditions run in your family? Have you seen other doctors about this problem? What did they tell you? If your doctor thinks it might be Fabry disease, he will ask you to either take a blood test so he can measure the level of alpha-galactosidase A, or take a DNA test. When your doctor says you have Fabry disease, that may be the first time you've heard of it. You probably have a lot of questions, especially if you've been trying to figure out for a long time what's causing your symptoms. You may want to start by asking your doctor questions like these: How did you diagnose Fabry disease? How has it affected my body? How many people with Fabry disease have you treated? Are there other doctors you would recommend that I see? What treatment do you recommend? How will we know if the treatment is working? What are the side effects? Do other people in my family need to get genetic testing to see if they have it? Are my children likely to get Fabry disease? There are two options available for treatment. The most common has been enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT) which replaces the enzyme that is missing or not working correctly. This allows your body to break down fatty also substances the way it should. It will also help ease the pain and other symptoms that Fabry disease causes. You will probably visit an outpatient center every few weeks to get the enzyme injected into a vein. A newer option is the oral medication migalastat ( Galafold). It differs from ERT in that it works to stabilize the enzymes which are not working. This also helps ease the effects of the disease on your organs. Your doctor may recommend that you also take: Drugs to relieve pain (prescription or nonprescription) Medicine for stomach problems Blood thinners or other drugs for irregular heartbeat or other heart problems Blood pressure medicine, which also helps protect your kidneys You may need dialysis or a kidney transplant if Fabry disease has caused serious kidney damage. You can also expect to get regular tests to keep track of how you're doing. These may include: Blood, urine, and thyroid tests EKG (electrocardiogram). A nurse or other medical professional will attach soft, sticky patches to different parts of your body. These patches measure electrical signals from your heart and can tell how fast your heart is beating and if it has a healthy rhythm. Echocardiogram. This is an ultrasound of your heart. It can show if all the parts of your heart are healthy and if it's pumping well. Brain MRI. An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, makes pictures of organs and structures inside your body. CT of your head. CT, or computed tomography, is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Hearing and eye exams Lung function test to see how much air you breathe in and out, and how much oxygen is getting to your blood Be good to yourself. Do things that you enjoy, spend time with people who are good company, and save your energy for the things that really matter to you. Part of that may involve saying ""no"" more often, and letting people know what would help you. That's OK to do! Your family and friends may not know much about Fabry disease. Help them understand what's going on with you. Sometimes, when people have serious health conditions, they get depressed or anxious because the condition is a lot to deal with. Your doctor should check on how you're feeling, but you may want to bring it up and ask for a referral to a counselor. Talking to someone can help a lot. Although there is no cure for Fabry disease, treatment can bring your symptoms under control. Even though you may not feel sick or seem to be having any problems, it's important that you follow up with treatments and tests as your doctor suggests. You can find others living with Fabry disease and their caregivers through the Fabry Support & Information Group."
109,"A hip (acetabular) labral tear is damage to cartilage and tissue in the hip socket. In some cases, it causes no symptoms. In others it causes pain in the groin. It can make you feel like your leg is ""catching"" or ""clicking"" in the socket as you move it. Over time, labral tears in the hip may cause permanent damage to the joint. The labrum is a band of tough cartilage and connective tissue that lines the rim of the hip socket, or acetabulum. It cushions the joint of the hip bone, preventing the bones from directly rubbing against each other. The labrum also helps keep the leg bone in place and increases stability of the joint. The labrum can tear for many reasons. Some people get a torn labrum from falls or car accidents. Sports that require regular rotation of the hip -- like golf, soccer, hockey, and ballet -- increase the risk. So do running and sprinting. But almost 75% cases of torn acetabular labrum have no known direct cause. Instead, these tears may develop gradually. Labral tears in the hip have been linked to osteoarthritis. However, it's not clear if they contribute to its development or are a symptom of it. Labral tears of the hip are more common in women. They also occur more often in people who have abnormalities of the hip structure, like hip dysplasia and other conditions. In recent years, experts have found that acetabular labral tears are much more common than once thought. Studies show that up to 22% of athletes who complain of groin pain have a labral tear in the hip."
110,"Worried about catching the flu? Want to learn some ways to prevent it? Then read on to learn more about influenza -- what it is, how it's spread, and who's at greatest risk for getting it. Knowledge is power when it comes to preventing flu! Influenza, commonly known as the ""flu,"" is an extremely contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza A or B viruses. Flu appears most frequently in winter and early spring. The flu virus attacks the body by spreading through the upper and/or lower respiratory tract. The common cold and flu are both contagious viral infections of the respiratory tract. Although the symptoms can be similar, flu is much worse. A cold may drag you down a bit, but the flu can make you shudder at the very thought of getting out of bed. Congestion, sore throat, and sneezing are common with colds. Both cold and flu may bring coughing, headache, and chest discomfort. With the flu, though, you are likely to run a high fever for several days and have body aches, fatigue, and weakness. Symptoms of the flu also tend to come on abruptly. Usually, complications from colds are relatively minor, but a case of flu can lead to a life-threatening illness such as pneumonia. More than 100 types of cold viruses are known, and new strains of flu evolve every few years. Since both diseases are viral, antibiotics cannot conquer cold or flu. Remember: Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections. Two antiviral medications are available to treat flu. But there are no medications that specifically defeat the common cold. Antibiotics may be helpful only if there is a secondary bacterial infection. For in-depth information, see Web MD's Flu Treatment. "" Stomach flu"" is a popular term, but not a true medical diagnosis. It's not uncommon to mistake gastroenteritis, which is what stomach flu is, for the viral infection we commonly call the ""flu."" Gastroenteritis refers to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines). Viruses are the most common cause of stomach flu. With gastroenteritis, you may have symptoms such as abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. For more about gastrointestinal flu, read Web MD's Stomach Flu or Influenza? The flu virus is spread from person to person through respiratory secretions and typically sweeps through large groups of people who spend time in close contact, such as in daycare facilities, classrooms, college dormitories, military barracks, offices, and nursing homes. Flu is spread when you inhale droplets in the air that contain the flu virus, make direct contact with respiratory secretions through sharing drinks or utensils, or handle items contaminated by an infected person. In the latter case, the flu virus on your skin can infect you when you touch or rub your eyes, nose, or mouth. That's why frequent and thorough handwashing is a key way to limit the spread of influenza. Flu symptoms start to develop from one to four days after infection with the virus. While anyone can get flu, infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with chronic ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and HIV are at highest risk for flu complications. Despite advances in flu prevention and treatment, the CDC estimates that deaths related to influenza range from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths in the United States each year. Specific strains of flu can be prevented by a flu vaccine, either a flu shot or nasal spray flu vaccine. In addition, antiviral medications are available to prevent flu. These drugs may help reduce the severity and the duration of flu and are best used within the first 48 hours of the appearance of flu symptoms. For in-depth information, see Web MD's Flu Complications. Researchers divide flu viruses into three general categories: types A, B, and C. All three types can mutate, or change into new strains, and type A influenza mutates often, yielding new strains of the virus every few years. This means that you can never develop a permanent immunity to influenza. Even if you develop antibodies against a flu virus one year, those antibodies are unlikely to protect you against a new strain of the flu virus the next year. Type A mutations are responsible for major flu epidemics every few years and for the major pandemics that can occur, though rarely. Type B is less common and generally results in milder cases of flu. However, major flu epidemics can occur with type B every three to five years. Type C causes infection but does not cause typical flu symptoms. Both influenza A and B have been linked to the development of Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal complication that usually affects children and teens under age 18. Widespread outbreaks of Reye's syndrome have occurred with influenza type B and also with chickenpox, but other viruses have been implicated. The risk of Reye's syndrome is increased when taking aspirin, so anyone under age 18 should not take aspirin if they have any viral symptoms or are recovering from the flu or any other virus. Most influenza viruses that infect humans seem to originate in parts of Asia, where close contact between livestock and people creates a hospitable environment for mutation and transmission of viruses. Swine, or pigs, can catch both avian (meaning from birds, such as poultry) and human forms of a virus and act as hosts for these different viral strains to meet and mutate into new forms. The swine then transmit the new form of the virus to people in the same way in which people infect each other -- by transmitting viruses through droplets in the air that people breathe in. For in-depth information, see Web MD's Types of Flu. Bird flu, or avian influenza, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. Bird flu epidemics have occurred worldwide. Bird flu is a leading contender to be the next pandemic flu bug because it has caused an unprecedented epidemic in poultry and wild birds across Asia and Eastern Europe. Still, no one knows for sure whether this will cause the next human flu pandemic. For in-depth information, see Web MD's Understanding Avian or Bird Flu."
111,"A whole aisle of over-the-counter cold and flu medicines awaits you at the store. But with so many options, how do you choose? Simple. Look for medicines that treat your specific symptoms. Here's a symptom-by-symptom guide. Stuffy nose: Look for decongestant pills that contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine. Decongestants help a stuffy nose by shrinking swollen nasal passages that cause congestion. You can also try decongestant nose drops or sprays, but you should not use these products for more than 3 days. Saline (saltwater) nose sprays or rinses can also help relieve congestion and break up mucus. These sprays are safe to use as often as you want. Headache or body aches: Choose a pain reliever that contains acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. If you take one of these, look at any other medicines you're taking to make sure they don't contain the same drug. Many cold and flu treatments have the same ingredients. Fever: Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen can ease your fever, which may help you feel better. Cough: There are two types of over-the-counter cough medicines: expectorants and cough suppressants. Expectorants, like guaifenesin, help thin mucus so you can cough it up more easily. Cough suppressants, such as dextromethorphan, help control cough. You can buy these medicines separately or combined. Ask your doctor or pharmacist which is best for your cough. Cough drops and throat lozenges can also reduce your urge to cough. Sore throat: Use throat lozenges or cough drops to soothe your sore throat. Or try a pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Don’t give over-the-counter cold and flu medicines to children under 4. For children ages 4-6, only give them if a doctor recommends it. Read the label so you can match the symptoms to the right medicine. Make sure you use the right medicine and the right dose for your child’s age and weight. With a little TLC, you'll most likely feel better within a week to 10 days. But if your symptoms are severe, get worse, or aren’t getting better after 7 days, call your doctor."
112,"More than 1 million Americans have heart attacks each year. A heart attack, or myocardial infarction ( MI), is an event that causes permanent damage to the heart muscle. "" Myo"" means muscle, ""cardial"" refers to the heart and ""infarction"" means death of muscle tissue due to lack of blood and oxygen supply. Heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to nourish it. The coronary arteries provide the heart with this critical blood supply. If you have coronary artery disease, those arteries become narrow -- or obstructed -- and blood cannot flow as well as it should. Fatty matter, calcium, proteins and inflammatory cells build up within the arteries to form plaques of different sizes and consistencies. This is sometimes what causes the initial symptoms of coronary artery disease. With the build-up of plaque, there is less delivery of oxygen to the heart muscle, especially when there is a demand for oxygen (during exertion or exercise) and chest pain or symptoms can develop. The outer surface of the plaque may rupture or crack and platelets (disc-shaped particles in the blood that help form blood clots) then come to the area to form blood clots around the plaque -- like a scab. If a blood clot totally obstructs the artery, the heart muscle can become starved for oxygen. This is called ischemia. And within a short time (even minutes), death of heart muscle cells occurs, causing permanent damage. This is a heart attack. While it is unusual, a heart attack can also be caused by a spasm of a coronary artery. Coronary arteries have a muscle lining which can contract or relax depending on the needs of the heart muscle at a given time. During a coronary spasm, the coronary arteries constrict or spasm without warning, reducing blood supply to the heart muscle and potentially causing a heart attack. It may occur at rest and can even occur in people without significant coronary artery disease. Each coronary artery supplies blood to a specific region of heart muscle. The amount of damage to the heart muscle depends on the size of the area supplied by the blocked artery and the time between injury and treatment. Earlier treatment can reduce the impact of the heart attack. Healing of the heart muscle begins soon after a heart attack and takes about eight weeks. Similar to a skin wound, the heart's wound heals and a scar will form in the damaged area. However, the new scar tissue does not contract. Therefore, the heart's pumping ability can be reduced after a heart attack. The amount of lost pumping ability depends on the size and location of the scar. Symptoms of a heart attack include: Discomfort, pressure, heaviness, or pain in the chest, arm or below the breastbone Discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat or arm Fullness, indigestion or choking feeling (may feel like heartburn) Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness Extreme weakness, anxiety or shortness of breath Rapid or irregular heartbeats Fatigue During a heart attack, symptoms may last 30 minutes or longer and are not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Some people have a heart attack without having any symptoms (a ""silent"" myocardial infarction). A silent MI can occur in anyone, though it is more common among diabetics. After a heart attack, quick treatment to open the blocked artery is essential to decrease the amount of damage. At the first signs of a heart attack, call for emergency treatment (usually 911). Waiting before treatment increases the risk of damage to your heart and also reduces your chance of survival. Keep in mind that chest discomfort can be described many ways. It can occur in the chest or in the arms, back or jaw. If you have any of these symptoms, take them seriously. Seek medical care immediately. To diagnose a heart attack, an emergency care team will ask you about your symptoms and begin to evaluate you. The diagnosis of the heart attack is based on your symptoms as well as your test results. The goal of treatment is to treat you quickly and limit heart muscle damage. Tests to Diagnose Heart Attacks Electrocardiogram. The electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG) can provide information about the extent and location of heart muscle damage. It also detects your heart rate and rhythm. whether or not you are having a heart attack. Blood tests. Blood may be drawn to measure levels of cardiac enzymes that indicate heart muscle damage. These enzymes are normally found inside the cells of your heart and are needed for their function. When your heart muscle cells are injured, their contents -- including the enzymes -- are released into the bloodstream. By measuring the levels of these enzymes, the doctor can determine approximately when the heart attack started. Echocardiography. An echocardiogram (also called an echo) is an ultrasound test that can be used to learn how the heart is pumping overall and what areas might not be pumping normally. The echo can also determine if any structures of the heart (such as the valves and septum) have been injured during the heart attack. Cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization, also called a cardiac cath or an angiogram, is an invasive test performed to directly visualize (using X-rays) the size and extent of blockage in the coronary arteries. It is frequently recommended in the first hours of a heart attack if medications are not relieving the ischemia or symptoms. The cardiac catheterization can be used to help your doctor determine which procedure is needed to treat the blockage. Balloon angioplasty, coronary stenting, and coronary artery bypass surgery may be recommended in addition to medications. Once a heart attack is diagnosed, treatment begins immediately -- possibly in the ambulance or emergency room. Drugs, catheter-based procedures, and surgery are used to treat a heart attack. The goals of drug therapy are to break up or prevent blood clots, prevent platelets from gathering and sticking to the plaque, stabilize the plaque, and prevent further damage. These medications must be given as soon as possible to decrease the amount of heart damage. The longer the delay in starting these drugs, the more damage can occur and the less benefit they can provide. Drugs used to treat a heart attack may include: Aspirin to prevent blood clotting that may worsen the heart attack. Antiplatelets to prevent blood clotting. Thrombolytic therapy (""clot busters"") to dissolve blood clots that are present in the heart's arteries. Any combination of the above Other drugs, given during or after a heart attack, lessen your heart's workload, improve the functioning of the heart, widen or dilate your blood vessels, decrease your pain, and guard against any life-threatening heart rhythms. During or shortly after a heart attack, you may go to the cardiac catheterization lab for direct evaluation of the status of your heart, arteries, and the amount of heart damage. In some cases, procedures (such as balloon angioplasty or stents) are used to open up your narrowed or blocked arteries. These procedures may be combined with thrombolytic therapy (drug treatments) to open up the narrowed arteries, as well as to break up any clots that are blocking them. If necessary, bypass surgery may be performed to restore the heart muscle's supply of blood. Treatments (medications, open heart surgery, and interventional procedures, like angioplasty) do not cure coronary artery disease. Having had a heart attack or treatment does not mean you will never have another heart attack; it can happen again. But, there are several steps you can take to prevent further attacks. The goal after a heart attack is to keep the heart healthy and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. Your best opportunities to ward off future attacks is to take your medications, change your lifestyle, and see your doctor for regular heart checkups. Medications are prescribed after a heart attack to: Prevent future blood clots. Lessen the heart's workload and improve its performance and recovery. Limit plaques by lowering cholesterol. Other drugs may be prescribed if needed. These include medications to treat irregular heartbeats, lower blood pressure, control chest pain, and treat heart failure. It is important to know the names of your medications, what they are used for, and how often and at what times you need to take them. Your doctor or nurse should review your medications with you. Keep a list of your medications and bring them to each of your doctor visits. If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. There is no cure for coronary artery disease. In order to prevent the progression of this disease, you must follow your doctor's advice and make necessary lifestyle changes. You can stop smoking, treat your blood cholesterol, control your diabetes and high blood pressure, follow an exercise plan, maintain an ideal body weight, and control stress. It is also important to start a heart healthy diet. Make a doctor's appointment for two to six weeks after leaving the hospital. Your doctor will want to check the progress of your recovery. She may ask you to undergo diagnostic tests (such as an exercise stress test or echocardiogram at regular intervals). These tests can help your doctor diagnose the presence or progression of blockages in your coronary arteries and plan treatment. Call your doctor sooner if you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath -- especially at rest, dizziness, or irregular heartbeats."
113,"Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori) is a type of bacteria. These germs can enter your body and live in your digestive tract. After many years, they can cause sores, called ulcers, in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of your small intestine. For some people, an infection can lead to stomach cancer.  Infection with H. pylori is common. About two-thirds of the world's population has it in their bodies. For most people, it doesn't cause ulcers or any other symptoms. If you do have problems, there are medicines that can kill the germs and help sores heal. As more of the world gets access to clean water and sanitation, fewer people than before are getting the bacteria. With good health habits, you can protect yourself and your children from H. pylori. For decades, doctors thought people got ulcers from stress, spicy foods, smoking, or other lifestyle habits. But when scientists discovered H. pylori in 1982, they found that the germs were the cause of most stomach ulcers. After H. pylori enters your body, it attacks the lining of your stomach, which usually protects you from the acid your body uses to digest food. Once the bacteria have done enough damage, acid can get through the lining, which leads to ulcers. These may bleed, cause infections, or keep food from moving through your digestive tract. You can get H. pylori from food, water, or utensils. It's more common in countries or communities that lack clean water or good sewage systems. You can also pick up the bacteria through contact with the saliva or other body fluids of infected people. Many people get H. pylori during childhood, but adults can get it, too. The germs live in the body for years before symptoms start, but most people who have it will never get ulcers. Doctors aren't sure why only some people get ulcers after an infection. If you have an ulcer, you may feel a dull or burning pain in your belly. It may come and go, but you'll probably feel it most when your stomach is empty, such as between meals or in the middle of the night. It can last for a few minutes or for hours. You may feel better after you eat, drink milk, or take an antacid. Other signs of an ulcer include: Bloating Burping Not feeling hungry Nausea Vomiting Weight loss for no clear reason Ulcers can bleed into your stomach or intestines, which can be dangerous to your health. Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms: Stool that is bloody, dark red, or black Trouble breathing Dizziness or fainting Feeling very tired for no reason Pale skin color Vomit that has blood or looks like coffee grounds Severe, sharp stomach pain It's not common, but H. pylori infection can cause stomach cancer. The disease has few symptoms at first, such as heartburn. Over time, you may notice: Belly pain or swelling Nausea Not feeling hungry Feeling full after you eat just a small amount Vomiting Weight loss for no reason If you don't have symptoms of an ulcer, your doctor probably won't test you for H. pylori. But if you have them now or have in the past, it's best to get tested. Medicines like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) can also damage your stomach lining, so it's important to find out what's causing your symptoms so you can get the right treatment. To start, your doctor will ask you about your medical history, your symptoms, and any medicines you take. Then she'll give you a physical exam, including pressing on your belly to check for swelling, tenderness, or pain. You may also have: Tests of your blood and stool, which can help find an infection Urea breath test. You'll drink a special liquid that has a substance called urea. Then you'll breathe into a bag, which your doctor will send to a lab for testing. If you have H. pylori, the bacteria will change the urea in your body into carbon dioxide, and lab tests will show that your breath has higher than normal levels of the gas. To look more closely at your ulcers, your doctor may use: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In a hospital, a doctor will use a tube with a small camera, called an endoscope, to look down your throat and into your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine. The procedure may also be used to collect a sample that will be examined for the presence of the bacteria. You may be asleep or awake during the procedure, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable. Upper GI tests. In a hospital, you'll drink a liquid that has a substance called barium, and your doctor will give you an X-ray. The fluid coats your throat and stomach and makes them stand out clearly on the image. Computed tomography ( CT) scan. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. If you have H. pylori, your doctor may also test you for stomach cancer. This includes: Physical exam Blood tests to check for anemia, when your body doesn't have enough red blood cells. It could happen if you have a tumor that bleeds. Fecal occult blood test, which checks your stool for blood that's not visible to the naked eye Endoscopy Biopsy, when a doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your stomach to look for signs of cancer. Your doctor may do this during an endoscopy. Tests that make detailed pictures of the insides of your body, such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) If you have ulcers caused by H. pylori, you'll need treatment to kill the germs, heal your stomach lining, and keep the sores from coming back. It usually takes 1 to 2 weeks of treatment to get better. Your doctor will probably tell you to take a few different types of drugs. The options include: Antibiotics to kill the bacteria in your body, such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin ( Biaxin), metronidazole ( Flagyl), tetracycline ( Sumycin), or tinidazole ( Tindamax). You'll most likely take at least two from this group. Drugs that reduce the amount of acid in your stomach by blocking the tiny pumps that produce it. They include dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant), esomeprazole ( Nexium), lansoprazole ( Prevacid), omeprazole ( Prilosec), pantoprazole ( Protonix), or rabeprazole ( Aciphex). Bismuth subsalicylate, which may also help kill H. pylori along with your antibiotics Medicines that block the chemical histamine, which prompts your stomach to make more acid. These are cimetidine ( Tagamet), famotidine ( Fluxid, Pepcid), nizatidine ( Axid), or ranitidine ( Zantac). Your treatment could mean you'll take 14 or more pills per day for a few weeks, which seems like a lot of medicine. But it's really important to take everything that your doctor prescribes and to follow her instructions. If you don't take antibiotics the right way, bacteria in your body can become resistant to them, which makes infections harder to treat. If your medications bother you, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and how you can handle side effects. About 1-2 weeks after you finish your treatment, your doctor may test your breath or stool again to make sure the infection is gone. You can protect yourself from getting an H. pylori infection with the same steps you take to keep other germs at bay: Wash your hands after you use the bathroom and before you prepare or eat food. Teach your children to do the same. Avoid food or water that's not clean. Don't eat anything that isn't cooked thoroughly. Avoid food served by people who haven't washed their hands. Though stress, spicy foods, alcohol, and smoking don't cause ulcers, they can keep them from healing quickly or make your pain worse. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage your stress, improve your diet, and, if you smoke, how you can get help to quit. Most ulcers caused by H. pylori will heal after a few weeks of treatment. If you've had one, you should avoid taking NSAIDs for pain, since these drugs can damage your stomach lining. If you need pain medicine, ask your doctor to recommend some. You can find information about H. pylori infection and ulcers from the American College of Gastroenterology. For information on stomach cancer, as well as online and local support groups, visit the American Cancer Society."
114,"If you're over 50 and you have type 2 diabetes, you face many of the same eye problems as people who don't have the disease, like cataracts and glaucoma. But there are steps you can take to maintain good eye health and prevent vision loss. Cataracts, when the eye's lens clouds up, are a common cause of vision loss and a normal part of the aging process. Glaucoma, a disease that damages your optic nerve, is a leading cause of blindness for people over 60. They're not specific to diabetes, but they can show up earlier if you have it. It all depends on how well you control your blood sugar. And they're just two more reasons you need to work closely with your doctor to keep the disease under control. If you already have one of these conditions, talk to your eye doctor about treatment. Early action can prevent blindness from glaucoma. Surgery can remove cataracts. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common type of diabetic eye disease. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to have some degree of diabetic retinopathy. How bad it will be depends on how well you control your blood sugar. High blood sugar levels damage blood vessels throughout your body, including the ones in your retina. This thin layer of light-sensitive tissue lines the back of the eye and sends light to your brain. That's what allows you to see. There are 2 types: 1. Background or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR): This is the earliest stage. Damaged blood vessels begin to leak into the retina. NPDR can cause changes in the eye including: Macular edema: Blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula and it swells. Located in the center of your retina, it's what gives you your pinpoint vision. This won't lead to blindness, but it can cause blurred vision. It can get better once you get your blood sugar and blood pressure under control. If it doesn't improve, lasers or medications injected directly into your eye may help. Macular ischemia: This loss of blood flow results when small blood vessels in your retina close up. Your vision blurs because the macula no longer gets enough blood to work like it should. 2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR): This advanced stage mainly happens when vessels in the retina close up and deprive it of blood. In an attempt to supply blood to the affected area, the retina creates new but abnormal and weak vessels. They can grow into the wrong place and break easily. PDR can cause more severe vision loss than NPDR. You may not notice any changes in the early stages. That's why you need regular eye exams. Even if you don't have any signs of or risk factors for eye disease, get a screening test at age 40. If you have diabetes, get a dilated exam as soon as you're diagnosed. Your doctor will put drops in your eye to widen the pupil. That lets him get a better look at your retina and optic nerve. Adults with type 2 diabetes should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Your eye doctor will let you know if you need to come in more often. Let him know if you notice sudden vision changes. Blurry vision can result from blood sugar that's too high or too low."
115,"When your immune system is on point, it's a lifesaver. But as good as it may be, it's not perfect. Sometimes, this group of special cells, tissues, and organs doesn't act the way it should. If it kicks into action too often, you may get a condition like allergies, asthma, or eczema. Or if your immune system starts to attack your body instead of safeguarding it, you could have an autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes. At least 80 illnesses are caused by immune system problems. They can all cause inflammation. But do you know the other warning signs? Keep in mind that these possible clues can happen for many other reasons. To figure out what's going on with your health, you'll want to see your doctor. If your blood vessels are inflamed, it can be harder for your fingers, toes, ears, and nose to keep warm. The skin in these areas may turn white, then blue, when you're exposed to the cold. Once blood flow returns, the skin may then turn red. Doctors call this â Raynaud's phenomenon.â Immune system problems can cause it, but so can other things, including smoking, some prescription drugs, and conditions that affect your arteries. Diarrhea that lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks can be a warning sign that your immune system is harming the lining of your small intestine or digestive tract. Constipation is a concern, too. If your bowel movements are hard to pass, very firm, or look like they're made up of small rabbit pellets, your immune system may be forcing your intestine to slow down. Other possible causes include bacteria, viruses, and other health conditions. If you have an autoimmune disorder, that means your immune system attacks your body instead of defending it. Rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are two examples. Many people who have an autoimmune disorder find that they have dry eyes. You might feel a sandy, gritty feeling like something is in your eye. Or you may notice pain, redness, a stringy discharge, or blurred vision. Some people find they can't cry even when they're upset. Feeling extremely tired, like you do when you have the flu, could mean something's going on with your body's defenses. Sleep is unlikely to help. Your joints or muscles can ache, too. Again, there could be many other reasons why you feel this way. If you're running a higher temperature than normal, it could be that your immune system is starting to overwork. That can happen due to an oncoming infection or because you're starting to have a flare of an autoimmune condition. In some cases, headaches can be related to the immune system. For example, it could be vasculitis, which is inflammation of a blood vessel caused by an infection or autoimmune disease. Your skin is your body's first barrier against germs. How it looks and feels can reflect how well your immune system is doing its job. Itchy, dry, red skin is a common symptom of inflammation. So is a rash that is painful or doesn't clear up. People with lupus often get a butterfly-shaped rash across their nose and cheeks. When the lining inside your joints becomes inflamed, the area around them is tender to the touch. It might also be stiff or swollen, and it can happen with more than one joint. You may notice that it's worse in the morning. Sometimes the immune system attacks hair follicles. If you lose hair on your scalp, face, or other parts of your body, you could have a condition called alopecia areata. Strands or clumps of hair coming out can also be a symptom of lupus. If you need to take antibiotics more than twice a year (four times for children), your body may not be able to attack germs well on its own. Other red flags: Chronic sinus infections, being sick with more than four ear infections in a year (for anyone over the age of 4), or having pneumonia more than once. People with an autoimmune disorder sometimes have an allergic reaction to ultraviolet ( UV) rays called photodermatitis. You may get blisters, a rash, or scaly patches after being in the sun. Or you may get chills, a headache, or nausea. It can be completely innocent. But in some cases it can mean that your body is attacking nerves that send signals to your muscles. People who have Guillain- Barre syndrome, for instance, may have numbness that starts in their legs then moves up to their arms and chest. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( CIDP) has symptoms similar to the demyelinating form of GBS (called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or AIDP), but while GBS lasts two weeks to 30 days. CIDP lasts much longer. If you have a tough time getting food down, your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach) could be swollen or too weak to work well. Some people feel like food is stuck in their throat or chest. Others gag or choke when they swallow. One of the possible causes can be a problem with your immune system. You find yourself gaining extra pounds even though your eating habits and workouts haven't changed. Or the number on your scale may drop for no clear reason. It's possible this is because of damage to your thyroid gland from an autoimmune disease. Sometimes your immune system decides to fight the skin's pigment-making cells, called melanocytes. If so, you'll start to see white patches of skin on your body. Called jaundice, it may mean that your immune system is attacking and destroying healthy liver cells. That can lead to a condition called autoimmune hepatitis."
116,"You'd probably notice if your poop is a different hue than normal. But what does it mean if it's green? What about red, yellow, white, and black? Most of the time, minor changes in the color of your waste are due to diet. After all, we don't eat the same thing at every meal, every day. But sometimes a color change can signal a minor health issue. In rare cases, it means something serious is wrong in your digestive system. If the color you see before you flush worries you, call your doctor. Poop is normally brown. The color is the result of what you eat and how much bile is in your stool. Bile is a fluid your liver makes to digest fats. It starts out as a yellowish green color. But as the pigments that give bile its color travel through your digestive system, they go through chemical changes and turn brown. Most of the time, green or greenish poop is normal. Some of the things that can cause it: Green veggies, like spinach or kale Green food coloring, such as in drink mixes or ice pops Iron supplements If you have green diarrhea, the color of your food may not be to blame. It's likely that your meal moved through your gut too quickly, so the fat-digesting bile didn't have time to turn brown. This shade is also normal for many people. It's common for babies, especially those who breastfeed. But if you have yellow poop that looks greasy and smells very bad, it may have too much fat. That could be a sign your body isn't digesting food properly. For example, if you have celiac disease, your body can't handle a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, barley, and rye. If you have the condition and eat foods that have gluten, like many breads, pastas, and cookies, your intestines won't work as they should. There may be other causes of yellow poop that's greasy and smelly. If it happens to you often, tell your doctor. Medicines for diarrhea like bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) can sometimes cause pale or clay-colored poop. So can barium, a chalky liquid you drink before you get X-rays of the upper part of your digestive tract. A more serious cause is a lack of bile in your stool. ( Remember, bile gives poop its brown color.) Bile is made in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into your small intestine to help digest your food. If there's not enough of it to give your poop its typical brown color, it could be the sign of a problem along the way. Liver disease, such as hepatitis, can keep bile from getting into your body waste. So can a blockage in the tubes (called ducts) that carry bile. This can happen because of: Gallstones Tumor A condition you're born with called biliary atresia Babies' poop is black for the first few days after they're born. After that, it may be because you ate something very dark-colored or took a medicine or supplement that causes black poop. But this color can be a sign of a more serious problem: bleeding in the upper part of your digestive tract. Foods, medicines, and supplements that turn poop black include: Iron supplements Bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) Black licorice Blueberries Poop that looks like tar is often a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract. Some causes include: Ulcers Bleeding sores in your esophagus from acid reflux Noncancerous tumors Cancer If you don't think black poop came from what you ate, you need to talk to your doctor. If you see red or reddish poop in the toilet, don't be alarmed right away. First ask yourself if you've had red foods lately. Beets, Jell- O, tomato soup, and red drinks can change the color of your stool. If you don't think your diet is the cause, the red you see may be blood. And if it's bright red, the blood likely comes from the lower part of your digestive tract. Common causes include: Noncancerous tumors Cancer Inflammation in the colon, called colitis Growths called polyps in your colon Conditions caused by small sacs in the wall of the colon, called diverticular disease Hemorrhoids Call your doctor if you see red that's probably not from food you ate."
117,"Childhood leukemia, the most common type of cancer in children and teens, is a cancer of the white blood cells. Abnormal white blood cells form in the bone marrow. They quickly travel through the bloodstream and crowd out healthy cells. This raises the body's chances of infection and other problems. As tough as it is for a child to have cancer, it's good to know that most children and teens with childhood leukemia can be successfully treated. Doctors don't know exactly what causes most cases of childhood leukemia. But certain things may raise the chances of getting it. Keep in mind, though, that having one of these things does not necessarily mean a child will get leukemia. In fact, most children with leukemia don't have any known risk factors. The risk for childhood leukemia increases if your child has: An inherited disorder such as Li- Fraumeni syndrome, Down syndrome, or Klinefelter syndrome An inherited immune system problem such as ataxia telangiectasia A brother or sister with leukemia, especially an identical twin A history of being exposed to high levels of radiation, chemotherapy, or chemicals such as benzene (a solvent) A history of immune system suppression, such as for an organ transplant Although the risk is small, doctors say children who have things that make leukemia more likely should get regular checkups to spot any problems early. Almost all cases of childhood leukemia are acute, which means they develop rapidly. A tiny number are chronic and develop slowly. Types of childhood leukemia include: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL), also called acute lymphocytic leukemia. ALL accounts for 3 out of every 4 cases of childhood leukemia. Acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML). AML is the next most common type of childhood leukemia. Hybrid or mixed lineage leukemia. This is a rare leukemia with features of both ALL and AML. Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML). CML is rare in children. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL). CLL is very rare in children. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML). This is a rare type that is neither chronic nor acute and happens most often in children under age 4. Symptoms of leukemia often prompt a visit to the doctor. This is a good thing, because it means the disease may be found earlier than it otherwise would. Early diagnosis can lead to more successful treatment. Many signs and symptoms of childhood leukemia happen when leukemia cells crowd out normal cells. Common symptoms include: Fatigue or pale skin Infections and fever Easy bleeding or bruising Extreme fatigue or weakness Shortness of breath Coughing Other symptoms may include: Bone or joint pain Swelling in the abdomen, face, arms, underarms, sides of neck, or groin Swelling above the collarbone Loss of appetite or weight loss Headaches, seizures, balance problems, or abnormal vision Vomiting Rashes Gum problems To diagnose childhood leukemia, the doctor will take a thorough medical history and do a physical exam. Tests are used to diagnose childhood leukemia as well as classify its type. Initial tests may include: Blood tests to measure the number of blood cells and see how they appear Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, usually taken from the pelvic bone, to confirm a diagnosis of leukemia Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to check for spread of leukemia cells in the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord A pathologist examines cells from the blood tests under a microscope. This specialist also checks bone marrow samples for the number of blood-forming cells and fat cells. Other tests may be done to help determine which type of leukemia your child may have. These tests also help the doctors know how likely the leukemia is to respond to treatment. Certain tests may be repeated later to see how your child responds to treatment. Have an honest talk with your child's doctor and other members of the cancer care team about the best options for your child. Treatment depends mainly upon the type of leukemia as well as other things. The survival rates for most types of childhood leukemia have gone up over time. And treatment at special centers for children and teens has the advantages of specialized care. Childhood cancers tend to respond to treatment better than adult cancers do, and children's bodies often tolerate treatment better. Before cancer treatment begins, sometimes a child needs treatment to address illness complications. For example, changes in blood cells can lead to infections or severe bleeding and may affect the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. Treatment may involve antibiotics, blood transfusions, or other measures to fight infection. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for childhood leukemia. Your child will get anticancer drugs by mouth, or into a vein or the spinal fluid. To keep leukemia from returning, there may be maintenance therapy in cycles over a period of 2 or 3 years. Sometimes, targeted therapy is also used. This therapy targets specific parts of cancer cells, working differently than standard chemotherapy. Effective for certain types of childhood leukemia, targeted therapy often has less severe side effects. Other types of treatment may include radiation therapy. This uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. It can also help prevent or treat the spread of leukemia to other parts of the body. Surgery is rarely an option to treat childhood leukemia. If standard treatment is likely to be less effective, a stem cell transplant may be the best option. It involves a transplant of blood-forming stem cells after whole body radiation combined with high-dose chemotherapy happens first to destroy the child's bone marrow. The FDA has approved a type of gene therapy for children and young adults up to age 25 whose B-cell ALL doesn't get better with other treatments. Scientists are working on a version of this treatment for people over 25 and for other kinds of cancer. CAR T-cell therapy uses some of your own immune cells, known as T cells, to treat your cancer. Doctors take the cells out of your blood and change them by adding new genes. The new T cells can work better to find and kill cancer cells."
118,"Unfortunately, hamstring strains are both common and painful. They strike athletes of all sorts -- including runners, skaters, and football, soccer, and basketball players.  But what is a hamstring? It isn't actually a single ''string.'' It's a group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh. They allow you to bend your leg at the knee. During a hamstring strain, one or more of these muscles gets overloaded. The muscles might even start to tear. You're likely to get a hamstring strain during activities that involve a lot of running and jumping or sudden stopping and starting. Getting a hamstring strain is also more likely if: You don't warm up before exercising. The muscles in the front of your thigh (the quadriceps) are tight as they pull your pelvis forward and tighten the hamstrings. Weak glutes. Glutes and hamstrings work together. If the glutes are weak, hamstrings can be overloaded and become strained. Mild hamstring strains may not hurt too much. But severe ones can be agonizing, making it impossible to walk or even stand. Other possible symptoms of a hamstring strain are: Sudden and severe pain during exercise, along with a snapping or popping feeling Pain in the back of the thigh and lower buttock when walking, straightening the leg, or bending over Tenderness Bruising To diagnose a hamstring strain, a doctor or physical therapist will give a thorough physical exam. He or she will ask specific questions about how the leg was injured. Luckily, minor to moderate hamstring strains usually heal on their own. You just need to give them some time. To speed the healing, you can: Rest the leg. Avoid putting weight on the leg as best you can. If the pain is severe, you may need crutches until it goes away. Ask your doctor or physical therapist if they're needed. Ice your leg to reduce pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every three to four hours for two to three days, or until the pain is gone. Compress your leg. Use an elastic bandage around the leg to keep down swelling. Elevate your leg on a pillow when you're sitting or lying down. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), like ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) will help with pain and swelling. However, these drugs may have side effects, such as an increased risk of bleeding and ulcers. They should be used only short term, unless your doctor specifically says otherwise. Practice stretching and strengthening exercises if your doctor/physical therapist recommends them. Strengthening your hamstrings is one way to protect against hamstring strain. In severe cases where the muscle is torn, you may need surgery. The surgeon will repair the muscles and reattach them. Recovery time depends on how badly you injured the hamstring. Keep in mind that people heal at different rates. While you get better, you should work the hamstring with a new activity that won't aggravate the strain. For instance, runners could try doing laps in a pool. Whatever you do, don't rush things. Don't even try to return to your old level of physical activity until: You can move your leg as freely as your uninjured leg Your leg feels as strong as your uninjured leg You feel no pain in your leg when you walk, then jog, then sprint, then finally jump If you start pushing yourself before the hamstring strain is healed, you could re-injure the hamstring and develop permanent muscle dysfunction. As hamstring strains can be nasty injuries, athletes should work hard to avoid them. After all, healing a hamstring strain is much harder than preventing it. Here are some tips: Warm up before and stretch after physical activity. Boost the intensity of your physical activity slowly -- no more than a 10% increase a week. Stop exercising if you feel pain in the back of your thigh. Stretch and strengthen hamstrings as a preventive measure."
119,"Treatment for ulcerative colitis can include medicine, changes in your diet, or surgery. These treatments won't cure your ulcerative colitis, unless you have surgery that removes the colon and rectum, which is considered curative, but they can help ease your symptoms. It's important to get treated for ulcerative colitis as soon as you start having symptoms. If you have severe diarrhea and bleeding, you might need to go the hospital to prevent or treat dehydration, reduce your symptoms, and make sure you're getting the right nutrition. Your doctor may suggest several types of medicines to curb inflammation in your bowel, including sulfa drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5- ASA). Balsalazide, mesalamine, olsalazine, and sulfasalazine are the main medications used to treat ulcerative colitis. They come in pills and suppositories. Let your doctor know if you are allergic to sulfa before taking one of these drugs. He can prescribe a sulfa-free 5- ASA. Corticosteroids. These anti-inflammatory drugs can be used if 5- ASA drugs don't work for you or if you have more severe disease. These medicines sometimes have side effects and long-term complications, so doctors often suggest them for short periods of time to help you get in remission. Your doctor may then prescribe you a 5- ASA medication to keep your symptoms away for a longer period. Immunosuppressants. If corticosteroids or 5- ASA drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe these kinds of drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP), azathioprine ( Azasan, Imuran), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus ( Astagraf XL, Envarsus XR, Prograf). Biologics. This group of drugs includes adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita) and adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo) - biosimilars to Humira, certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia), golimumab ( Simponi, SImponi Aria), infliximab ( Remicade), ), Infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, tofacitinib ( Xeljanz), and vedolizumab ( Entyvio). While food doesn't appear to play a role in causing ulcerative colitis, certain foods may cause more symptoms when your disease is active. Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. He may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements. Some people get surgery to remove part or all of the colon. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications. When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. He attaches a bag there and brings the tip of your lower small intestine through the opening. Waste passes through it and collects in a pouch, which gets attached to the stoma. You'd need to wear the pouch all the time. A newer surgery, called a pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis ( IPAA), doesn't create a permanent opening. Instead, a surgeon removes your colon and rectum, and your small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir that serves as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus. A procedure called a continent ileostomy ( Kock pouch) is done if you want your external pouch converted to an internal one, or if you can't get the IPAA operation. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. Your surgeon removes your colon and rectum and creates an internal reservoir from your small intestine. He makes an opening in your belly wall and joins the reservoir to your skin with a nipple valve. To drain the pouch, you insert a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir. Other techniques are also available. All surgeries carry some risk and complications. If you have been told you need surgery to treat ulcerative colitis, you may want to get a second opinion to make sure you get the best option for you. Call your doctor right away if you have: Heavy, persistent diarrhea Rectal bleeding with clots of blood in your stool Constant pain and a high fever"
120,"A venous skin ulcer is a sore on your leg that's very slow to heal, usually because of weak blood circulation in the limb. They can last anywhere from a few weeks to years. You may hear a doctor or nurse call them âvenous leg ulcers.â They can sometimes lead to more serious problems if you don't have them treated. But there are steps you can take to prevent them from happening. Venous ulcers happen when there's a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That's often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren't working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle. About 1% of Americans have venous skin ulcers. They're more common in older people, particularly women. You also may have a chance of getting one if you: Have previous leg injuries Have varicose veins Smoke Are obese Have had other circulation problems such as blood clots or phlebitis, a painful swelling of the veins A venous ulcer often feels itchy or burns, and the leg around it may be swollen. Other signs may include: A rash or dry skin Brownish discoloration A foul-smelling fluid oozing from the sore An ulcer can also become infected. If that happens, you might notice: A redness or swelling of the surrounding skin Worsening pain A fever Pus If you have a wound that isn't healing or you think is infected, you should see your doctor. Usually, all it takes is a quick examination of the sore and the skin around it to figure out whether you have a venous skin ulcer. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or âchronicâ) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries. In some cases, however, your doctor might order other tests, such as an X-ray or a CT scan, to check out your veins and the area around the ulcer in more detail. Sometimes, an ulcer can lead to other problems, including serious skin and bone infections. And in rare cases, it can give rise to skin cancer. The most common treatment is a compression bandage or stocking. The pressure should improve the blood circulation in your leg, boosting your body's ability to heal the sore. You'll probably be told to raise your leg for set lengths of time as well. This also helps circulation. Doctors typically recommend a half-hour at a time, 3 or 4 times a day. If your ulcer is infected by bacteria, you'll probably be given antibiotics to kill the infection. You might also be given a moist dressing to put over the ulcer to help it heal more quickly. In some cases, your doctor might recommend surgery to improve the circulation in your legs. This can help your ulcer heal and could prevent similar problems later. Most ulcers heal after 3 or 4 months of treatment. However, some can take longer, and some may never clear up. There are a variety of ways you can prevent venous skin ulcers through lifestyle changes, diet or medication. You might: Quit smoking Lose weight Control chronic conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes Take aspirin to prevent blood clots Reduce the amount of salt in your diet Exercise regularly Wear compression stockings Keep your legs elevated when you can"
121,"The alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) test is a blood test that checks for liver damage. Your doctor can use this test to find out if a disease, drug, or injury has damaged your liver. Your liver does a lot of important things for you: It makes a fluid called bile that helps your body digest food. It removes waste products and other toxins from your blood. It produces proteins and cholesterol. Diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis can damage your liver and prevent it from doing its many jobs. This enzyme is found mainly in your liver. Smaller amounts of ALT are in your kidneys and other organs, too. Your body uses ALT to break down food into energy. Normally, ALT levels in the blood are low. If your liver is damaged, it will release more ALT into your blood and levels will rise. ( ALT used to be called serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, or SGPT). Doctors often give the ALT test along with other liver tests. Your doctor might recommend ALT if you have symptoms of liver disease or damage, such as: Stomach pain or swelling Nausea Vomiting Yellow skin or eyes (a condition called jaundice) Weakness Extreme tiredness (fatigue) Dark-colored urine Light-colored poop Itchy skin Here are some reasons you might get this test: You've been exposed to the hepatitis virus. You drink a lot of alcohol. You have a family history of liver disease. You take medicine that's known to cause liver damage. The ALT test can be done as part of a blood panel during a regular exam. If you've already been diagnosed with liver disease, your doctor can use the ALT test to see how well your treatment is working. You don't need any special preparation for the ALT test. Your doctor might ask you to stop eating or drinking a few hours before the test. Tell your doctor what prescription drugs or supplements you take. Some medicines can affect the results of this test. A nurse or lab tech will take a sample of your blood, usually from a vein in your arm. He will first tie a band around the upper part of your arm to make your vein fill with blood and swell up. Then he will clean the area with an antiseptic and place a needle into your vein. Your blood will collect into a vial or tube. The blood test should take only a couple of minutes. After your blood is taken, the lab tech will remove the needle and band, then put a piece of gauze and a bandage over the spot the needle went in to stop the bleeding. The ALT blood test is safe. Risks are usually minor, and can include: Bleeding Bruising Infection Slight pain when the needle is inserted Fainting or feeling dizzy You should get your results in about a day. A normal ALT test result can range from 7 to 55 units per liter ( U/ L). Levels are normally higher in men. Slightly high ALT levels may be caused by: Alcohol abuse Cirrhosis (long-term damage and scarring of the liver) Mononucleosis Drugs such as statins, aspirin, and some sleep aids Moderately high ALT levels may be because of: Chronic (ongoing) liver disease Alcohol abuse Cirrhosis Blockage of the bile ducts Heart attack or heart failure (when your heart can't pump enough blood to your body) Kidney damage Muscle injury Damage to red blood cells Heat stroke Too much vitamin A Very high ALT levels can be caused by: Acute viral hepatitis An overdose of drugs such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) Liver cancer Sepsis ALT usually is done as part of a group of liver function tests called a liver panel. This panel also includes an aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) test. AST is another liver enzyme. As with ALT, the levels of AST in your blood rise if your liver is damaged. Comparing ALT with AST levels gives your doctor more information about the health of your liver. The ALT-to- AST ratio can help your doctor figure out how severe the liver damage is and what might have caused it. To find out what type of liver disease you have, your doctor might also test the levels of other enzymes and proteins found in your liver, including: Albumin Alkaline phosphatase Bilirubin Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) Total protein Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand all of your liver test results. Also find out how these results might affect your treatment."
122,"Lipedema may affect up to 11% of women. It happens when fat is distributed in an irregular way beneath your skin, usually in the buttocks and legs. Although it begins as a cosmetic concern, it can eventually cause pain and other problems. Lipedema can be mistaken for regular obesity or lymphedema.  The typical symptoms are a large lower half and column-like legs, which are often tender and bruise easily. For example, the top half of your body may be a size 8, but the bottom half may be a size 16. As the condition progresses, fat continues to build up, and your lower body grows heavier. The lipedemic fat can later collect in the arms. Over time, fat cells block the vessels of your lymphatic system, which normally helps balance body fluid levels and protect against infection. This blockage prevents the proper drainage of lymph fluid, leading to a buildup of fluid called lymphedema. If not treated, lymphedema can lead to problems such as infections, delayed wound healing, development of scar-like tissue called fibrosis, and hardened skin in the legs. Unlike obesity, it targets legs, thighs and sometimes arms. Unlike lymphedema, lipedema doesn't start in the lower legs (feet and ankles) but the upper legs, and it isn't related to prior surgery. It usually affects both legs. The cause is not known, but doctors suspect female hormones play a role. That's because the condition affects mostly women, and it often begins or worsens at puberty, during pregnancy, following gynecologic surgery, and around the time of menopause. Scientists also believe genes are involved, because many women with the condition have family members with the condition. A treatment called complete decongestive therapy can ease painful symptoms. Complete decongestive therapy involves: Manual lymphatic drainage. A form of massage that uses gentle, rhythmic pumping movements to stimulate the flow of lymph around blocked areas to healthy vessels, where it can drain into the venous system. This helps relieve pain and prevent fibrosis. Compression. The use of stretch bandages or custom-fitted panty hose, panties, or spandex shorts to increase tissue pressure in the swollen legs and lessen the odds of fluid building up again. Exercise. Helps to reduce fluid buildup, boost mobility, and maintain or improve how well your legs work. Thorough skin and nail care. Helps lower the risk of wounds and infection if you have lipedema associated with swelling. Liposuction, specifically water-assisted liposuction and tumescent liposuction, can remove the lipedema fat. The procedure uses a hollow tube that is placed under the skin to suction the fat tissue. Several sessions may be needed depending on the amount of abnormal fat."
123,"You have options for different types of medications to ease endometriosis pain. Although they won't cure the condition, they may help you feel better. Some need a prescription. Others you can buy âover the counter.â Your doctor may recommend that you try more than one kind. If your symptoms are mild, your doctor will likely suggest you take a pain reliever. These may include NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Sometimes endometriosis pain can be severe. So, if you try pain meds that you can buy without a prescription and you don't get enough relief, your doctor will consider whether you need a prescription for a stronger type of medicine. This type of treatment may be a good choice if pain medicines don't help enough. Doctors can prescribe medicines that cut down on how much estrogen your body makes. There are also hormonal meds that can prevent your menstrual period and make areas affected by endometriosis bleed less. That cuts down on inflammation and makes scars and ovarian cysts less likely. The most common hormones that doctors prescribe for endometriosis include: Birth control pills, patches, and vaginal rings. These contraceptives include both estrogen and progestin. Meds that affect gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( Gn RH). You take them either as a nasal spray, shot, or pill. Doctors usually recommend limiting their use to 12 months at a time because of side effects that could affect your heart and bones. Your doctor may call these Gn RH agonists, analogues, or antagonists: Elagolix ( Orilissa) -- Oral tablet taken twice daily Goserelin ( Zoladex) -- Shot taken once every 28 days Leuprolide ( Lupron) -- Shot taken once every 1 or 3 months Nafarelin ( Synarel) -- Nasal spray taken twice per day Doctors limit the number of months these meds are taken because of bone density loss that can increase the risk of fractures. Progestin-only contraceptives. These include pills, shots, and an IUD (intrauterine device). These medicines can cut down on pain, as most women don't have a period while taking these medicines, or at least have fewer periods. Danazol ( Danocrine). This medicine stops your body from releasing hormones that it uses to help bring about your period. You need to be on birth control while you take it to prevent pregnancy. If you get pregnant while taking danazol, it could cause a female baby to have male traits. Hormone therapy can cause side effects such as weight gain, depression, acne, body hair, and irregular bleeding. You should talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits. Also, if you stop taking this type of medicine, your symptoms may come back. Tell your doctor if that happens. Aromatase is a chemical that boosts your body's estrogen production. Aromatase inhibitors block it, which lowers your estrogen level. These medicines aren't routinely used to treat endometriosis. But in some cases, doctors recommend it ""off label"" in addition to hormonal therapy to manage endometriosis pain, as long as you aren't planning to get pregnant while on this treatment."
124,"You're more likely to get type 2 diabetes if: 1. Diabetes runs in your family. If you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it, your chances rise. But you can take action through everyday lifestyle habits, like exercise and healthy eating, to lower your odds of following in their footsteps. 2. You have prediabetes. That means your blood sugar level is above normal but you don't have the disease yet. To keep it that way, get more active and lose any extra weight. Your doctor may recommend you take the prescription drug metformin. 3. You're not physically active. It's never too late to change that. Check in with your doctor first, so you know what's safe for you to do. 4. You're overweight, especially around your waist. Not everyone with type 2 diabetes is overweight, but extra pounds make you more likely to get the condition. Belly fat seems to be particularly risky. 5. You've had heart disease. 6. You have high blood pressure. 7. Your ""good"" cholesterol level is low. It's too low if it's less than 40 mg/d L (milligrams per deciliter). 8. Your triglyceride level is high. It's too high if it's over 150 mg/d L. 9. You've had diabetes during pregnancy before. That condition (called gestational diabetes) or delivering a baby over 9 pounds can make you more likely to get type 2 diabetes. 10. You're a woman who has PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). 11. You're age 45 or older. The chance of getting type 2 diabetes rises with age. But diabetes isn't a normal part of aging. 12. You're Hispanic, African- American, Native American, or Asian American. Diabetes is more common among these groups. Talk with your doctor to get a better sense of your risk. He can help you make a plan that will keep you in good health."
125,"Immunotherapy is a treatment option for many people living with advanced lung cancer. It helps your body's immune system better find and destroy cancer cells, even when they try to hide. The breakthrough therapy is helping some people with hard-to-treat cancer feel better and live longer. But it doesn't work for everyone. Scientists are hard at work to find new treatments to help more. If you or a loved one is scheduled to have lung cancer immunotherapy, you need to know the key warning signs of treatment failure and what to do if they occur. How Do You Know It Isn't Working? Four immunotherapy medicines, called checkpoint inhibitors, are FDA-approved for lung cancer: atezolizumab ( Tecentriq), durvalumab ( Imfinzi), nivolumab ( Opdivo), and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda). No one can tell you how well these treatments will work for you. There's no blood test or other method to predict if the drug will shrink your tumor or make you feel better. However, there are some signs that it isn't helping. Tell your doctor if you have: Cough Pain Trouble breathing Any other symptoms that concern you They may be a sign that your cancer is getting worse, or they may be side effects of treatment. Only a doctor can tell the difference. Side effects don't mean the medicine isn't fighting your cancer -- but a severe reaction can be life threatening and may require you to stop treatment. Serious side effects are rare, but include inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis), liver, kidneys, intestines, and other parts of the body. When the Cancer Looks Worse but Isn't Your doctor will order CT scans of your tumor to keep track of it and make sure your treatment is working. Your cancer might look worse on the first CT scan after your start immunotherapy. But it may really be getting better. Doctors call this âpseudoprogression."" It doesn't mean the drug isn't working. Immunotherapy causes your immune system to attack cancer cells. The rush of helper immune cells can cause your tumor to swell and look bigger. The report may say your cancer has progressed, when it really hasn't. Your doctor will review your scans and discuss your symptoms. She'll decide if your treatment is really working and your cancer is stable. If the scan shows a larger tumor but there are no new areas of cancer and you feel OK, it may be pseudoprogression. Doctors usually suggest you wait two or three more treatment cycles (about 2 months) then get another scan. If you feel worse and the scan shows a larger tumor and new lesions, immunotherapy likely isn't working. The doctor will recommend you stop it and try something else. Other Treatment Options If immunotherapy doesn't work, you and your doctor will discuss other ways to treat your cancer. These include: Chemotherapy Targeted drug treatments Radiation If these options also fail, your doctor may suggest you to take part in a clinical trial. They provide access to cutting-edge immunotherapy treatments that aren't yet approved for lung cancer. These include other checkpoint inhibitors, therapeutic vaccines, and adoptive T-cell transfer. If nothing helps at all, it may be time to ask your doctor if it's time to stop treatment and start hospice and palliative care to ease your symptoms and make you feel better. An honest discussion will help you and your family make the most of every day."
126,"People can learn to manage stress and lead happier, healthier lives. Here are some tips to help you keep stress at bay. Keep a positive attitude. Accept that there are events that you cannot control. Be assertive instead of aggressive. Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, defensive, or passive. Learn and practice relaxation techniques; try meditation, yoga, or tai-chi. Exercise regularly. Your body can fight stress better when it is fit. Eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Learn to manage your time more effectively. Set limits appropriately and say no to requests that would create excessive stress in your life. Make time for hobbies and interests. Get enough rest and sleep. Your body needs time to recover from stressful events. Don't rely on alcohol, drugs, or compulsive behaviors to reduce stress. Drugs and alcohol can stress your body even more. Seek out social support. Spend enough time with those you love. Seek treatment with a psychologist or other mental health professional trained in stress management or biofeedback techniques to learn more healthy ways of dealing with the stress in your life."
127,"Living with a long-term condition like hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS) can be tough emotionally. You might feel like people won't understand what you're dealing with. But there are good ways to handle any stress and keep yourself feeling good. You may have spent years trying to hide your symptoms, and think they're too embarrassing to talk about. But people who care about you are an important source of support. Be open with your family and close friends about what you feel, physically and emotionally. It's natural to fear what others might say. But keeping things inside only adds to your stress. Also, consider other ways to handle your situation: See a professional counselor for help with your feelings and to find ways to handle stress. Look for a support group or online forum. You can share your experience with people who know what you're going through. They may have tips on how to deal with the things you're worried about. Plan how you'd like to explain your condition to an acquaintance or respond to a comment from a stranger. Practice saying it to family or friends until you feel comfortable. It may help to let people know that HS isn't contagious and has nothing to do with bad hygiene. For some people, HS brings feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression. It can be hard to stop negative thoughts once they start. Try these strategies: Acknowledge your feelings. Notice what emotions you're having, and know that it's OK to feel them. Learn your triggers. Pay attention to the things that bring on negative thoughts and emotions. Maybe you can avoid them. Challenge negative thoughts. Ask yourself if you might be wrong, or if there's another way to look at the issue. Be kind to yourself. Think about what you'd tell your best friend if she said the same things about herself. Don't turn to alcohol, drugs, or food for comfort. It can take someone years to find out that they have hidradenitis suppurativa. Some people are too embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms. It's also easy to mistake HS for a different skin problem. Getting the right diagnosis can be a relief. It can also be hard to find the right treatment. Be open with your doctor about your symptoms and how they affect your daily life. It may help to write down what you want to talk about. And speak up if you don't get relief. You may need to find a doctor who specializes in HS. HS can bring unpredictable flare-ups. Take positive steps to feel more in control: Get to a healthy weight. People who are obese are more likely to have HS. Losing weight can keep it in check. It also lowers your chances of having other health problems and may help you feel better in general. Stop smoking. Watch what you eat. Ask your doctor if any specific foods might make your HS worse. Exercise. Even if you may have pain and trouble moving, stay as active as possible. Exercise can slow HS down and make you feel better. Many people find swimming keeps them fit and also soothes their skin. Care for yourself. Keep track of what helps your HS and what seems to make it worse, and come up with a plan to manage your flare-ups. Follow your doctor's instructions, and take any medicines they prescribe."
128,"In about 10% of people, high blood pressure is caused by another disease. If that is the case, it is called secondary hypertension. In such cases, when the root cause is treated, blood pressure usually returns to normal or is significantly lowered. These causes include the following conditions: Chronic kidney disease Sleep apnea Tumors or other diseases of the adrenal gland Coarctation of the aorta -- A narrowing of the aorta that you are born with that can cause high blood pressure in the arms Pregnancy Use of birth control pills Alcohol addiction Thyroid dysfunction In the other 90% of cases, the cause of high blood pressure is not known (primary hypertension). Although the specific cause is unknown, certain factors are recognized as contributing to high blood pressure. Age: The older you get, the greater the likelihood that you will develop high blood pressure, especially systolic, as your arteries get stiffer. This is largely due to atherosclerosis, or ""hardening of the arteries."" Race: African- Americans have high blood pressure more often than whites. They develop high blood pressure at a younger age and develop more severe complications sooner. Family history (heredity): The tendency to have high blood pressure appears to run in families. Gender: Generally men have a greater likelihood of developing high blood pressure than women. This likelihood varies according to age and among various ethnic groups. Obesity: Obesity is defined as being 30% or more over your healthy body weight. It is very closely related to high blood pressure. Indeed, obese people are two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure than people whose weight is within a healthy range. Medical professionals strongly recommend that all obese people with high blood pressure lose weight until they are within 15% of their healthy body weight. Your health care provider can help you calculate your healthy body weight range. Sodium (salt) sensitivity: Some people have high sensitivity to sodium (salt), and their blood pressure goes up if they use salt. Reducing sodium intake tends to lower their blood pressure. Americans consume 10-15 times more sodium than they need. Fast foods and processed foods contain particularly high amounts of sodium. Many over-the-counter medicines, such as painkillers, also contain large amounts of sodium. Read labels to find out how much sodium is contained in food items. Avoid those with high sodium levels. Your goal should be to consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day. Alcohol use: Drinking more than 1-2 drinks of alcohol per day tends to raise blood pressure in those who are sensitive to alcohol. Birth control pills (oral contraceptive use): Some women who take birth control pills develop high blood pressure. Lack of exercise (physical inactivity): A sedentary lifestyle contributes to the development of obesity and high blood pressure. Drugs: Certain drugs, such as amphetamines (stimulants), diet pills, and some pills used for cold and allergy symptoms, tend to raise blood pressure."
129," Atypical depression is a subtype of major depression or dysthymic disorder that involves several specific symptoms, including increased appetite or weight gain, sleepiness or excessive sleep, marked fatigue or weakness, moods that are strongly reactive to environmental circumstances, and feeling extremely sensitive to rejection. Atypical depression can be a ""specifier"" for either major depression or dysthymic disorder. People with atypical depression have often experienced depression first at an early age, during their teenage years. A person with classic majordepression has at least five of the following nine symptoms: Sadness or depressed mood most of the day or almost every day Loss of enjoyment in things that were once pleasurable Major change in weight (gain or loss of more than 5% of weight within a month) or appetite Insomnia or excessive sleep almost every day A state of physical restlessness or being rundown that is noticeable by others Fatigue or loss of energy almost every day Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness or excessive guilt almost every day Problems with concentration or making decisions almost every day Recurring thoughts of death or suicide, suicide plan, or suicide attempt Dysthymic disorder, now known in the psychiatric community as ""persistent depressive disorder"" or chronic major depression, is a condition involving the presence of a depressed mood more days than not for at least a two year period in adults (one year in children and adolescents) plus at least two of the above associated symptoms, but fewer than the five symptoms which define a major depressive episode. Despite its name, atypical depression is very common. It is contrasted with ""melancholic"" depression, another subtype of depression, involving symptoms of insomnia (rather than oversleeping), loss of appetite (rather than increased appetite), a relative lack of mood reactiveness to environmental circumstances, and a markedly diminished ability to feel pleasure. One of the main characteristics of atypical depression that distinguishes it from melancholic depression is mood reactivity. In other words, the person with atypical depression will see his or her mood improve if something positive happens. In melancholic depression, positive changes will seldom bring on a change in mood. In addition, diagnostic criteria call for at least two of the following symptoms to accompany the mood reactivity: Sleeping too much (hypersomnia) Increased appetite or weight gain Having a more intense reaction or increased sensitivity to rejection, resulting in problems with social and work relationships Having a feeling of being weighed down, paralyzed, or ""leaden"" A doctor will investigate physical causes for any of these symptoms. That will include a physical exam and tests to look for a problem such as hypothyroidism. With hypothyroidism, having low levels of thyroid hormone can lead to symptoms that include depression and weight gain. Depression is believed to be the result of impaired functioning of brain circuits that regulate mood, and that allow one region of the brain to communicate with another. Nerve cells contained within these circuits transmit signals through brain chemicals called neurotransmitters -- such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Antidepressant medicines are thought to ""tweak"" these chemicals and thereby improve the efficiency of brain circuits related to mood. While the exact cause of depression is unknown, there are risk factors for depression, including: A family history of depression A significant loss -- from death, divorce, or separation -- that may trigger an underlying vulnerability to depression (rather than simply normal grief) Interpersonal conflicts and related emotions such as guilt Any type of abuse -- physical, sexual, or emotional Any type of major life event such as moving, changing or losing a job, graduating, retiring, or social isolation in people who have a biological vulnerability to depression Any type of serious illness such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, or HIV Drug or alcohol abuse Doctors are likely to recommend psychotherapy (talk therapy) and/or medications for atypical depression, depending on the severity of the symptoms. There are different types of psychotherapy and medications available for treatment. You may be referred to a specialist such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other licensed mental health professional for care."
130,"Cancer of the stomach, or gastric cancer, is a disease in which stomach cells become malignant (cancerous) and grow out of control, forming a tumor. Almost all stomach cancers (about 95%) start in the glandular tissue that lines the stomach. The tumor may spread along the stomach wall or may grow directly through the wall and shed cells into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Once beyond the stomach, cancer can spread to other organs. Stomach cancers are classified according to the type of tissue in which they originate. Adenocarcinomas -- the most common -- start in the glandular stomach lining. Lymphomas develop from lymphocytes, a type of blood cell involved in the immune system. Sarcomas involve the connective tissue (muscle, fat, or blood vessels). Other types include carcinoid, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Metastatic cancers from breast cancer, melanoma, and other primary sites of cancer are also seen in the stomach. The number of stomach cancer cases has declined over the past 60 years. Even though it is not among the most common cancers in the U. S., it is still a leading cause of cancer deaths in other parts of the world. The exact cause of stomach cancer is unknown, but most are believed to result from exposure to carcinogens (various cancer-causing agents), especially nitrates. Nitrates are substances found in prepared foods (especially meats) that are dried, smoked, salted, or pickled. Carcinogens cause errors in the genetic code that controls growth and repair of cells. Various medical conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing stomach cancer. These include: Gastritis ( H. pylori) Pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency) Gastric polyps Chronic gastric ulcer Family history of gastric cancer History of gastric surgery for non-cancerous diseases, such as a peptic ulcer Blood group A Pre-malignant conditions, such as intestinal metaplasia Genetic abnormalities Hereditary factors such as familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( Lynch syndrome), and Peutz- Jeghers syndrome Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori) infection of the stomach lining is associated with gastric lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. H. pylori is a bacterium that infects the lining of the stomach and causes chronic inflammation and ulcers. The risk of developing cancer, in the presence of an infection with this bacteria is low. This bacterium can be found in up to two-thirds of the world's population. In persons infected with this bacterium, the risk of developing gastric cancer is thought to be up to six times that of non-infected persons. There is an increased risk of stomach cancer in people who use tobacco or drink alcoholic beverages regularly. People who work in certain industries are also at greater risk. This includes those in the coal mining, metal, and rubber industries. Stomach cancer is most often seen in people in their late 60s through 80s. It is more common in Japan, Korea, parts of Eastern Europe, and Latin America than in the U. S. and Canada. This is thought to be related to the common diet in these countries, which consists of nitrate-containing, salted foods -- especially meat and fish. Stomach cancer can be associated with long-term survival if it is found and treated at an early stage. However, it is usually diagnosed at a later stage. Unfortunately, the outlook is poor if the cancer is already advanced."
131,"The first time your baby tries solid foods is a big deal! Get the camera and camcorder to record her expressions and reactions. To prepare: Pick a time when your baby is happy and not too hungry, overtired or cranky. Make sure you're not rushed, so that you can enjoy the experience. Choose one food to introduce first. Feed that to her for a few days before introducing the next new food, to check for possible allergic reactions. If you note diarrhea, rashes, or vomiting after introducing a new food, stop offering it and consult your pediatrician. If you offer cereal, make sure it's one made specifically for babies; they're fortified with specific nutrients babies need at this age. Your Baby's Development This Week By now, your baby may be showing a lot of interest in the food that you're eating! The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for about six months, and notes that most babies are ready to start solid foods between four and six months. Here are some signs that your baby is ready: She loses the tongue-thrust reflex that pushes the spoon back out of her mouth. Sheï¿½ï¿½s interested in what you're eating -- making âoohâ sounds as she watches you eat, or trying to grab your fork or slice of bread. She can sit up with good head control in the high chair, although she still needs the support of her body. She can draw in her lower lip to take food from a spoon. You might wonder about: What kinds of foods to introduce first. Single-grain cereals, such as rice, are common first foods, but you don't have to start with these. You can try purees of any healthy food, including meats, vegetables or fruits. Should you start out with vegetables so your baby learns to like them? There's no evidence to support this. Babies have a natural preference for sweets and the order you introduce foods doesn't change that. How long to continue breastfeeding. Even after you start solids, breast milk or formula are your baby's primary source of nutrition for her first year. Keep breastfeeding for at least a year if you can. Can I just add the solids to the bottle? It's an important part of your baby's development to learn how to eat from a spoon and to join in family meal time. If your baby has been diagnosed with reflux, your pediatrician may have you add cereal to the bottle. Is your baby getting enough nutrients? If your baby is breastfeeding, you will need to supplement her with 400 IU of vitamin D daily during that time. Check with your pediatrician. Don't wait too long to start solid foods. While it is advisable to exclusively nurse for 6 months, once babies get much older than six months, they may be more set in their ways and reluctant to take to new foods. Not all medications are safe to take while you are breastfeeding. Check with your pediatrician or call poison control to check on anything you're taking, with or without a prescription. Your baby will add about 1 to 1.5 pounds per month and grow about 2-3 inches in length over the next 3 months. If your baby seems insatiably hungry or has little appetite at all, check with your pediatrician. Your baby may be teething, which can make him irritable. But teething rarely causes a fever. If your baby has a fever over 101 Farenheit, he is probably ill. See his doctor. Keep encouraging your baby's development with conversation, brightly colored toys, and interaction. Remember: While you're breastfeeding, limit the alcohol. Experts advise not drinking if you're breastfeeding. Questions? Ask your pediatrician."
132,"Complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS), also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, is a chronic pain condition in which high levels of nerve impulses are sent to an affected site. Experts believe that CRPS occurs as a result of dysfunction in the central or peripheral nervous systems. CRPS is most common in people ages 20-35. The syndrome also can occur in children; it affects women more often than men. There is no cure for CRPS. CRPS most likely does not have a single cause; rather, it results from multiple causes that produce similar symptoms. Some theories suggest that pain receptors in the affected part of the body become responsive to catecholamines, a group of nervous system messengers. In cases of injury-related CRPS, the syndrome may be caused by a triggering of the immune response, which may lead to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area. For this reason, it is believed that CRPS may represent a disruption of the healing process. The symptoms of CRPS vary in their severity and length. One symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain that gets worse rather than better over time. If CRPS occurs after an injury, it may seem out of proportion to the severity of the injury. Even in cases involving an injury only to a finger or toe, pain can spread to include the entire arm or leg. In some cases, pain can even travel to the opposite extremity. Other symptoms of CRPS include: "" Burning"" pain Swelling and stiffness in affected joints Motor disability, with decreased ability to move the affected body part Changes in nail and hair growth pattern; there may be rapid hair growth or no hair growth. Skin changes; CRPS can involve changes in skin temperature -- skin on one extremity can feel warmer or cooler compared to the opposite extremity. Skin color may become blotchy, pale, purple or red. The texture of skin also can change, becoming shiny and thin. People with CRPS may have skin that sometimes is excessively sweaty. CRPS may be heightened by emotional stress. There is no specific diagnostic test for CRPS, but some testing can rule out other conditions. Triple-phase bone scans can be used to identify changes in the bone and in blood circulation. Some health care providers may apply a stimulus (for example, heat, touch, cold) to determine whether there is pain in a specific area. Making a firm diagnosis of CRPS may be difficult early in the course of the disorder when symptoms are few or mild. CRPS is diagnosed primarily through observation of the following symptoms: The presence of an initial injury A higher-than-expected amount of pain from an injury A change in appearance of an affected area No other cause of pain or altered appearance Because there is no cure for CRPS, the goal of treatment is to relieve painful symptoms associated with the disorder. Therapies used include psychotherapy, physical therapy, and drug treatment, such as topical analgesics, narcotics, corticosteroids, osteoporosis medication, antidepressants, osteoporosis medicines, and antiseizure drugs. Other treatments include: Sympathetic nerve blocks: These blocks, which are done in a variety of ways, can provide significant pain relief for some people. One kind of block involves placing an anesthetic next to the spine to directly block the sympathetic nerves. Surgical sympathectomy: This controversial technique destroys the nerves involved in CRPS. Some experts believe it has a favorable outcome, while others feel it makes CRPS worse. The technique should be considered only for people whose pain is dramatically but temporarily relieved by selective sympathetic blocks. Intrathecal drug pumps: Pumps and implanted catheters are used to send pain-relieving medication into the spinal fluid. Spinal cord stimulation: This technique, in which electrodes are placed next to the spinal cord, offers relief for many people with the condition."
133,"If you have a bad back, you should buy the firmest mattress you can find -- right? Not so fast. While that used to be the common wisdom, there's no solid research behind it. The latest thinking is that there isn't one type of mattress that's best for everyone, including people with chronic back pain. Let personal preference guide you, and choose what feels most comfortable. But making the right choice can be tricky. So many products are on the market, and just because a mattress feels good when you lie down on it in a showroom doesn't mean you're going to be happy sleeping on it for the next several years. Here are a few tips to guide you: You may not realize it, but good posture is important when you sleep. The muscles and ligaments (tissue that holds joints together) in your back need to relax and recover while you snooze. If a mattress is too firm -- or too squishy -- it won't support your spine at your neck or lower back the way it needs to. What's firm enough (but not too firm) is different for everyone: If you have wide hips, for instance, a slightly softer surface may be better. You need some more give in order to keep your spine in alignment. Someone with narrower hips might be better off with a firmer surface. Research is limited, but in one study, researchers assigned new mattresses to more than 300 people with low back pain. They used either ""medium-firm"" or ""firm"" mattresses for 90 days. Those in the medium group reported the least amount of discomfort. You might consider getting a memory foam mattress (instead of a traditional innerspring one). The foam molds to your body. The downside: Some memory foam mattresses keep in heat; and the material might have more chemicals. If you have a great night's sleep and wake up pain-free after staying at a hotel or in a friend's guest room, copy down that mattress's model number. Or choose a mattress that comes with a money-back guarantee: A growing number of companies will let you buy a mattress and use it for anywhere from 30 to 100 days and send it back for a refund if you're not happy with it. When researchers from Oklahoma State University randomly assigned 62 people to sleep in a variety of new beds for 28 days, they found that almost everyone started to sleep better. That was true regardless of which model they were given, though people who slept in the cheapest beds did report more lower back pain than those in the medium- and higher-priced beds. The most important thing seemed to be that the beds were new. They noted that the average age of the participants' old beds was 9.5 years. And they concluded that ""sleep quality may be dependent on timely replacement of bedding systems."" The takeaway: If you've been sleeping on the same mattress for 9 or 10 years (or more), it's time to get a new one. Almost any new replacement is going to be better than the saggy foundation of an old mattress. But it may pay to spring for at least a mid-priced model. Even if you have the right mattress, it's not the only thing that counts when it comes to managing your back pain as you rest. Sleep position is important, as are the kind of pillows you use and where you place them."
134,"By 2030, nearly 3.5 million Americans will undergo total knee replacement surgery every year, and more than half a million will get total hip replacements. The vast majority of these surgeries are performed on people with osteoarthritis ( OA) that has not responded to standard OA treatment. Joint replacement or other surgical procedures are sometimes considered the âtreatment of last resortâ for people with osteoarthritis. Doctors frequently tell patients to wait as long as possible before joint replacement, but to get the best results, it should also not be delayed too long. How do you know when it's time to seek joint replacement surgery? Ask yourself these questions: Can I still do the things I enjoy doing, like golfing, shopping or playing with my grandchildren? Do the medications I take, and/or physical therapy, still alleviate the pain reasonably well? Can I sleep at night without waking up multiple times due to pain? Can I still do daily activities, like getting out of a chair, going up and down stairs, using the toilet, and getting into and out of the car without much difficulty? If the answers to all of these questions are yes, then you probably don't need to consider joint replacement surgery yet. On the other hand, if you answered ânoâ to most of them, then you should discuss joint replacement surgery as a possible option with your doctor. Just because your arthritis is severe enough to warrant joint replacement surgery, however, does not mean you are automatically a safe candidate for an operation. There are several conditions that may make joint replacement surgery riskier, including: Obesity . Your doctor may ask you to lose some weight before undergoing surgery, which will both lessen the risks of surgery (such as infections, bleeding, and problems with anesthesia) and give your new hip or knee a better chance of success. Age. If you're in your 90s, your doctor may discuss with you whether or not the risks of surgery are greater than the long-term benefits you may get from a new joint. Bone density. Severe osteoporosis needs to be considered before undergoing joint surgery. Heart, lung, or kidney disease. Having these conditions may make the use of anesthesia for surgery risky. Before you consider surgery, you will also need to prepare for what comes afterward and have realistic expectations of how much improvement to expect and how much work you will need to do to get the best outcome. The vast majority of people who undergo joint replacement surgery experience dramatic reductions in pain and a great improvement in their ability to do everyday things like going to the store, cleaning house, walking around town, and engaging in light exercise like walking, swimming, ballroom dancing, and stair climbing. But a joint replacement is not the original joint, and you can still have some restrictions on your activities. High impact activities should be avoided for the rest of your life. Here are some activities that you should probably avoid after hip or knee replacement, but speak with your doctor first: Jogging, running, or skiing Playing football, basketball, soccer, and other high-impact sports Doing karate or other martial arts Jumping rope Taking a high-impact aerobics class Your new knee or hip can last for more than 15 years, especially if you treat it well. But the more stress and strain you put on the joint, the sooner it is likely to wear out or become loose. Just as before you had joint replacement surgery, activities that put less weight on your joints, like swimming and cycling, are particularly good for exercising a new joint without overstressing it. In order to get the most function out of your new joint, there's a lot of hard work to be done right after surgery. You'll probably be in the hospital for several days, and during this time, physical therapists will teach you the right kind of exercises to do to restore movement in the affected joints. But after you go home, it will be up to you to keep up with the exercise program that your surgeon and physical therapist provide. A surgeon can put in the new knee or hip, but no one but you can exercise it. Before pursuing joint replacement surgery, you should commit to an exercise program that will include: Regular walking, first at home and later outdoors and for longer distance, aimed at gradually and safely increasing your mobility Gradually resuming other normal daily activities, like standing, climbing stairs, and getting up and down from a chair Daily, regular exercises designed to strengthen the muscles around your new joint; after your physical therapist teaches you these exercises, you can often do them at home. If you do all of these things, you are likely to have an excellent outcome should you choose joint replacement surgery. According to a study published in June 2008 in the Archives of Internal Medicine, older adults who had joint replacement surgery improved significantly on measurements of arthritis symptoms one year later compared with people who did not have the surgery."
135," A carbuncle is a red, swollen, and painful cluster of boils that are connected to each other under the skin. A boil (or furuncle) is an infection of a hair follicle that has a small collection of pus (called an abscess) under the skin. Usually single, a carbuncle is most likely to occur on a hairy area of the body such as the back or nape of the neck. But a carbuncle also can develop in other areas of the body such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, and armpits. Most carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, which inhabit the skin surface, throat, and nasal passages. These bacteria can cause infection by entering the skin through a hair follicle, small scrape, or puncture, although sometimes there is no obvious point of entry. Filled with pus -- a mixture of old and white blood cells, bacteria, and dead skin cells -- carbuncles must drain before they're able to heal. Carbuncles are more likely than boils to leave scars. An active boil or carbuncle is contagious: the infection can spread to other parts of the person's body or to other people through skin-to-skin contact or the sharing of personal items. So it's important to practice appropriate self-care measures, like keeping the area clean and covered, until the carbuncle drains and heals. Carbuncles require medical treatment to prevent or manage complications, promote healing, and minimize scarring. Contact your doctor if you have a boil or boils that have persisted for more than a few days. Older age, obesity, poor hygiene, and poor overall health are associated with carbuncles. Other risk factors for carbuncles include: Chronic skin conditions, which damage the skin's protective barrier Diabetes Kidney disease Liver disease Any condition or treatment that weakens the immune system Carbuncles also can occur in otherwise healthy, fit, younger people, especially those who live together in group settings such as college dorms and share items such as bed linens, towels, or clothing. In addition, people of any age can develop carbuncles from irritations or abrasions to the skin surface caused by tight clothing, shaving, or insect bites, especially in body areas with heavy perspiration. The boils that collect to form carbuncles usually start as red, painful bumps. The carbuncle fills with pus and develops white or yellow tips that weep, ooze, or crust. Over a period of several days, many untreated carbuncles rupture, discharging a creamy white or pink fluid. Superficial carbuncles -- which have multiple openings on the skin's surface -- are less likely to leave a deep scar. Deep carbuncles are more likely to cause significant scarring. Other carbuncle symptoms include fever, fatigue, and a feeling of general sickness. Swelling may occur in nearby tissue and lymph nodes, especially lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, or groin. Sometimes, carbuncles are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA) bacteria, and require treatment with potent prescription antibiotics if the lesions are not drained properly. In rare cases, bacteria from a carbuncle can escape into the bloodstream and cause serious complications, including sepsis and infections in other parts of the body such as the lung, bones, joints, heart, blood, and central nervous system. Sepsis is an overwhelming infection of the body that is a medical emergency and can be fatal if left untreated. Symptoms include chills, a spiking fever, rapid heart rate, and a feeling of being extremely ill. The cardinal rule is to avoid squeezing or irritating a carbuncle, which increases the risk of complications and severe scarring. Warm compresses may promote the drainage and healing of carbuncles. Gently soak the carbuncle in warm water, or apply a clean, warm, moist washcloth for 20 minutes several times per day. Similar strategies include covering the carbuncle with a clean, dry cloth and gently applying a heating pad or hot water bottle for 20 minutes several times per day. After each use, washcloths or cloths should be washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature. Washing the carbuncle and covering the area with a sterile bandage also may promote drainage and healing and help prevent the infection from spreading. Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain of an inflamed carbuncle. It's important to thoroughly wash your hands after touching a carbuncle. Launder any clothing, bedding, and towels that have touched a carbuncle and avoid sharing bedding, clothing, or other personal items. See your doctor if a boil or boils do not drain and heal after a few days of home treatment or if you suspect you have a carbuncle. Also, seek medical evaluation for a carbuncle that develops on your face, near your eyes or nose, or on your spine. Also see a doctor for a carbuncle that becomes very large or painful. Your doctor may cut and drain the carbuncle, and ensure that all the pus has been removed by washing the area with a sterile solution. Some of the pus can be collected and sent to a lab to identify the bacteria causing the infection and check for susceptibility to antibiotics. If the carbuncle is completely drained, antibiotics are usually unnecessary. But treatment with antibiotics may be necessary in cases such as: When MRSA is involved and drainage is incomplete There is surrounding soft-tissue infection (cellulitis) A person has a weakened immune system An infection has spread to other parts of the body Depending on severity, most carbuncles heal within two to three weeks after medical treatment."
136,"Chances are, acetaminophen is a mainstay in your medicine cabinet. You use it to ease aches and pains or bring down a fever. When you follow the instructions on those pill-bottle labels, it's helpful and safe, and it generally doesn't upset the stomach like other pain relievers. But if you take too much, it can hurt your liver. In extreme cases, it can even cause liver failure. It's still fine to use acetaminophen. You just need to know how to do that safely. More than 50 million Americans use acetaminophen each week. It's the most widely used drug ingredient in the U. S., found in more than 600 prescription and over-the-counter (â OTCâ) medications, including allergy pills, cold medicines, cough syrups, headache pills, and sleep aids. Never take more than one product at a time that's made with acetaminophen. For instance, if it's in your headache pill and your cold medicine, and you take them both, you could get more than you should. Check the â Active Ingredientsâ section of the â Drug Factsâ box on your OTC medication, or the label on your prescription, where it may be called â APAPâ or âacetam.â Read the label on your medication. Don't take more than directed, even if you're still in pain or don't feel well. Even when you stick to the recommended dose, you shouldn't take acetaminophen for more than 10 days for pain, or 3 days for fever. If you still feel like you need relief, call your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. Adults should not get more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day from all sources. That's no more than 12 regular-strength pills at 325 milligrams per pill, or 8 extra-strength pills at 500 milligrams per pill. For children, the daily limit depends on their weight and age. Check how many milligrams are in your child's doses, and follow the directions on the label exactly. You may need to switch your child's weight from pounds to kilograms -- you can use an online calculator to do that. If you're not sure how much is OK, ask your doctor or pharmacist. To help you keep track, write down all the medicines you give your child each day. Common reasons people mistakenly pass the daily limit include: They take too much at once. They don't wait long enough between doses. If you have more than three alcoholic drinks a day or have liver disease, ask your doctor before you take anything that has acetaminophen in it. In these cases, even the recommended dose could make liver damage more likely. If you think you may have accidentally taken too much acetaminophen, you may have: Nausea Loss of appetite Vomiting Sweating Diarrhea These symptoms may not start until hours after you've taken the drug. By the time you notice something's wrong, your liver may already be severely damaged. If you have questions about whether you took the right amount, call your local poison control center, which will tell you if you need to go to the ER. If you think someone may have overdosed, call 911."
137,"You've tried everything. Cough drops, decongestants, and some ibuprofen, too. But that sneezing, hacking, and all-around lousy feeling won't go away. Just as you're ready to wave the white flag, you start to wonder: Could an herbal remedy like echinacea save the day? Researchers are trying to find out. Their answer so far: We're just not sure. It's a flowering plant that grows in the U. S. and Canada, and it's been used as medicine for centuries. There are nine species. Some of its common names are the purple coneflower or black-eyed Susan. The leaves, stems, flower, and roots are used to make supplements, liquid extracts, and teas. Studies have had mixed results. Extracts of echinacea do seem to have an effect on the immune system, your body's defense against germs. Research shows it increases the number of white blood cells, which fight infections. A review of more than a dozen studies, published in 2014, found the herbal remedy had a very slight benefit in preventing colds. Two studies funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health did not find any help for a cold from echinacea in either children or adults, though. Still, sometimes it's hard to compare the results of different studies, because they look at different types and strengths of echinacea, as well as different parts of the plant or root. It's possible that some versions are better than others. Also, it's possible the herbal remedy may be useful against some, but not all, of the more than 200 viruses that cause colds. Although the benefits of echinacea for the common cold are uncertain, the risks seem to be low. The most common side effect is upset stomach. But some people can have allergic reactions. If this happens, you might get: Rashes Worsening of asthma symptoms Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening emergency that can cause trouble breathing) You might be at higher risk of having a reaction to echinacea if you're allergic to other plants in the daisy family. This includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, and marigolds. Echinacea might also not be safe for people who use certain drugs. Examples are some medications for heart problems -- like amiodarone ( Cordarone, Pacerone) -- and some anti-fungal treatments. The combination of echinacea and these medicines could cause liver damage. Some experts say you shouldn't take echinacea for more than 8 weeks at a time. Although there is no evidence that the herb would cause harm after this point, doctors don't know enough yet about its long-term safety. Keep in mind that herbal remedies like echinacea aren't regulated in the U. S. the way medications are. The makers of supplements don't have to show their products are safe or effective before they go on the market. Also, there's a chance that what you buy at the drugstore may not actually have what the label says it does. Many other herbs, plants, minerals, vitamins, and supplements are used by some people to help ease cold symptoms. Some examples are: Eucalyptus Garlic Honey Lemon Menthol Vitamin C Zinc But so far, no studies show that these treatments have an effect against a cold. If you're interested in using echinacea or another alternative treatment, talk to your doctor. Remember, herbal remedies may have risks, just like any drug. They can cause side effects and could affect how other medications work."
138,"When you're pregnant, your doctor will give you a number of routine tests to check for any health issues that might pose problems for you or your baby. One thing they may check you for early on is tuberculosis ( TB). It's a contagious bacterial disease that usually affects your lungs. If you don't get the right treatment for TB, it can be dangerous for you and your baby. You can die of it. So your doctor will want you to start treatment right away. You can have TB and not know it. That's called latent TB. But if you have active TB, you'll have symptoms like coughing for weeks, weight loss, bloody phlegm, and night sweats. The active form of the disease is more serious. But both active and latent TB can cause harm to your baby. She may be more likely to: Weigh less than a baby born to a healthy mother Be born with TB. This is rare. Catch TB from you after birth, if your disease is active and you aren't being treated You may worry that taking medicine for tuberculosis may harm your unborn child. It's much worse to leave it untreated. TB drugs you take do reach your baby. But they haven't been shown to cause harm in unborn babies. Some TB drugs can lead to birth defects or other problems in a growing baby. But your doctor won't prescribe those drugs if you're pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. The medicine you get will depend on what kind of TB you have. Latent TB. If you have no symptoms but tests show that you have the disease, you'll likely take a drug called isoniazid. You may need to take it every day for 9 months, or just twice a week during that time. You'll have to take vitamin B6 supplements at the same time. Active TB. Usually, you'll get three drugs at first: isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol. You'll probably need to take all three every day for 2 months. For the rest of your pregnancy, it's likely that you'll take only isoniazid and rifampin, either daily or twice a week. HIV and TB. If you also have HIV, your doctor probably will give you the same drugs to treat both diseases that she would give someone who's not pregnant. Talk to your doctor so you understand the safest options for you and your baby. If the drugs you try first don't work against your TB, you may have a drug-resistant form of the disease. Your doctor may recommend that you switch to so-called second-line drugs. Some of them aren't safe to take during pregnancy. They can cause birth defects and other problems. If you need second-line treatment, you may need to avoid or delay getting pregnant. Ask your doctor for counseling. After your baby is born, you should be able to breastfeed her safely, even if you're still taking first-line drugs for TB. If you're on isoniazid, keep taking vitamin B6 while you nurse your newborn. Although some of the drug will pass into your breast milk, the amount is too little to cause any harm."
139,"The fifth month is a time of transitions for your baby. You can expect him to make his first attempts at real speech. He's also gearing up to start crawling, which means you need to be ready for your little one's new mobility. This portion of Web MD's month-by-month guide describes a few of the baby milestones you can expect your child to reach at five months. Five-month-old babies can sit upright for longer periods of time. Your baby probably still needs to be propped up with a pillow or Boppy, but he may also be able to sit unsupported for a few seconds at a time. Some 5-month-olds can start rolling over from their back to their tummy. Once your baby does roll over, you may notice him working his legs and rocking. He's getting ready for crawling and scooting, which are just a couple of months away! But remember, when baby is able to roll over, make sure you never leave him on a bed or other high surface where he can accidentally roll off and get injured. Another thing you'll notice at five months is that your baby's grasp is getting stronger. He can pull objects closer and pick them up in the palm of his hand then move them adeptly from one hand to the other. He may even be able to hold a bottle or sippy cup by himself. Most babies sleep through the night by five months, but not all. To encourage your baby to get into a regular nighttime sleep rhythm, establish a bedtime routine. Start with a warm bath, followed by a few minutes of gentle rocking with a song and story, and his eyes are sure to start drooping. Get into the habit of putting your baby into the crib drowsy, rather than fully asleep. This way, he will learn how to soothe himself to sleep rather than relying on you. During the daytime, your baby will still need two naps -- one in the morning and one after lunch. Try not to delay naps until baby is already tired and cranky. Put him into the crib at the first signs of sleepiness. Your 5-month-old's vision is continuing to improve. At this point, babies still don't have 20/20 vision, but they can see well at different distances and their eyes can focus together without crossing. At five months, your baby's color perception has sharpened to the point where he can tell the difference between two shades of the same color. But babies at this age still prefer primary colors such as red, blue, and yellow. Your baby should be babbling away by now, and those babbles might even be starting to sound like real words. Five-month-olds can begin to put consonant and vowel sounds together (such as ''ba-ba''). If you hear a ''ma-ma'' or ''da-da'' in the mix, don't get too excited. Babies at this age haven't yet assigned meaning to words. Wait another couple of months and those ''ma-mas'' and ''da-das'' will be directed at you. At five months, babies are starting to make sense of the sounds they hear, such as a dog barking or a car engine starting. Though they can't yet understand words, they may turn their head at the sound of their name or a simple command like ''no.'' Babies love music. Play all kinds of songs for your 5-month-old, from classical to jazz to pop. He will clap, smile, and maybe even babble along. Give your baby simple, colorful toys like a soft block or rattle to play with. When you hand over each item, name it ('' This is a block,'' '' That's a rattle'') to help teach your baby new words. Consider removing the mobile hanging over your baby's crib. Once babies can push up onto their hands and knees, they can get caught up in the mobile's hanging cords. If you haven't baby-proofed your house by now, make sure you do it soon. Cover all electrical outlets, place household cleaners and other hazardous materials in locked cabinets, and put away all choking hazards. Also be very careful about not leaving steaming mugs of coffee or curling irons on countertops where your baby might pull them down."
140,"More than half of U. S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some form, and more are considering bills to do the same. Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome. Why hasn't more research been done? One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug. The agency did, however, agree to support additional research on marijuana and make the process easier for researchers."" Research is critically needed, because we have to be able to advise patients and doctors on the safe and effective use of cannabis,"" Bonn- Miller says. He shared some background on medical marijuana's uses and potential side effects. Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the ""high"" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it. ); Because marijuana contains some of the same chemicals found in tobacco, there have been concerns that smoking it could harm the lungs. The effects of inhaled marijuana on lung health aren't clear, but there's some evidence it might increase the risk for bronchitis and other lung problems. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says marijuana can be addictive and is considered a âgateway drugâ to using other drugs. "" The higher the level of THC and the more often you use, the more likely you are to become dependent,"" Bonn- Miller says. "" You have difficulty stopping if you need to stop. You have cravings during periods when you're not using. And you need more and more of it to have the same effect."" Another issue is that the FDA doesn't oversee medical marijuana like it does prescription drugs. Although states monitor and regulate sales, they often don't have the resources to do so. That means the strength of and ingredients in medical marijuana can differ quite a bit depending on where you buy it. "" We did a study last year in which we purchased labeled edible products, like brownies and lollipops, in California and Washington. Then we sent them to the lab,"" Bonn- Miller says. "" Few of the products contained anywhere near what they said they did. That's a problem."""
141,"If you have psoriasis, you may have noticed patches in unexpected places. Where can it happen? How can you deal with it when it does? Nearly half of all people with psoriasis have nail problems. That goes up to 80% in those with psoriatic arthritis. If you have either, you might notice your nails are: Pitted, with âpockingâ or holes in the nail Thicker than normal or discolored Separated from the nail bed What you can do: You may be able to disguise mild nail changes by scraping, filing, or polishing your nails. Try to keep your nails short. Avoid injury to them as much as you can, too. That can make things worse. For more serious problems, your doctor may give you corticosteroid injections in your nail bed. Many people with psoriasis have a fungal infection in their nails (called onychomycosis). Ask your doctor or dermatologist to see if you have it. If so, treating the fungal infection will help your nails. If you have severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, your doctor may want you to take a prescription medication that affects your whole body. That should ease nail problems, too. At least half of those with psoriasis have it here. It can cause mild scaling. That can look like and flake off like dandruff. But it's not the same. It can be severe. You can get thick, crusted patches that can cover parts or all of your scalp. It can even go past your hairline and onto your neck, ear area, and forehead. Scalp psoriasis is usually powdery looking. It may be silver in color. What you can do: Whether your condition is mild or severe, you may have to switch and combine treatments every now and then. That's because psoriasis can become resistant to a treatment after a while. If yours is mild, your dermatologist may recommend shampoos or topical solutions with tar or salicylic acid. Both lower the number of skin cells your body makes. They can ease itching, too. Your doctor may also suggest steroid scalp injections to reduce patches, or an antihistamine to deal with the itch. For more moderate to severe cases, you may get a prescription scalp ointment, liquid, cream, foam, or shampoo. Some of these have corticosteroids. If your psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis is severe and affects other areas of your body, you might be prescribed a medication that deals with all your symptoms. An example would be biologic drugs, which target specific parts of your immune system. If you notice a flare here, tell your doctor right away. It can lead to cracking, blistering, and swelling. These can be painful and raise your chances of infection. What you can do: Your first step is usually to put medicine directly on your palms and the soles of your feet. Your doctor may point you to: Tar products Salicylic acid Corticosteroid creams or ointments You'll probably have more success if you use more than one of these at a time. Your doctor may also suggest something called calcipotriene. It's a form of vitamin D. Wear cotton gloves or socks after you put it on so it can soak in without getting on other areas. If you have deep cracks in your skin, talk to your doctor about using superglue to seal them. Though this sounds odd, some dermatologists recommend it to keep cracks from getting worse. If those options don't work, you may be prescribed medicine (like methotrexate, which suppresses your immune system). He may also point you toward light therapy (also known as PUVA or UVB phototherapy). Only do that with your doctor's help. Psoriasis here is rare, but it does happen. Most of the time, patches are white or gray. They can be uncomfortable and may affect the way you talk and chew. What you can do: Talk to your doctor right away. She will probably recommend a low-potency steroid cream, like 1% hydrocortisone ointment. She may suggest a steroid-free treatment like pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, which will suppress your immune system. Psoriasis can affect your genitals. Some people only have it on their genitals. These flares are usually pink or red. They usually have little or no flaking or scaling. Psoriasis can also cause painful cracks, particularly between the buttocks. What you can do: Treating psoriasis here can be tricky. Moisturizing regularly can help. Ask your doctor about which moisturizer is best for you. Topical vitamin D creams and ointments are options, as are steroid creams. You'll usually get prescribed low-dose steroid creams or Eucrisa ointment (off-label, not FDA- approved) for a little while. That's because genital skin tends to be thin and steroid cream can make it even thinner. Coal tar products can irritate your genitals, so don't use them here. Don't use light therapy, either. The skin on this part of your body is susceptible to skin cancer. Friction can make things worse, so think about wearing loose-fitting cotton clothing, including underwear, especially while you're sleeping."
142,"Childhood depression is different from the normal ""blues"" and everyday emotions that occur as a child develops. Just because a child seems depressed or sad does not necessarily mean they have depression. But if these symptoms become persistent, disruptive and interfere with social activities, interests, schoolwork and family life, it may indicate that he or she is suffering from the medical condition depression. The symptoms of depression in children vary. Early medical studies focused on ""masked"" depression, where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. While this does occur, particularly in younger children, many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes and may include: Irritability or anger Continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness Social withdrawal Increased sensitivity to rejection Changes in appetite -- either increased or decreased Changes in sleep -- sleeplessness or excessive sleep Vocal outbursts or crying Difficulty concentrating Fatigue and low energy Physical complaints (such as stomachaches, headaches) that do not respond to treatment Reduced ability to function during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, extracurricular activities, and in other hobbies or interests Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Impaired thinking or concentration Thoughts of death or suicide Not all children have all of these symptoms. In fact, most will display different symptoms at different times and in different settings. Although some children may continue to function reasonably well, most kids with significant depression will suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in school and poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Children may also begin using drugs or alcohol, especially if they are over age 12. Although relatively rare in youths under age 12, young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. Suicide is a serious problem within the teenage population. Adolescent suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and young adults in the U. S. It is estimated that 500,000 teens attempt suicide every year with 5,000 completing the act. These are epidemic proportions. Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse, or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide, as are those with depressive symptoms. Parents should be particularly vigilant for signs that may indicate that their child is at risk for suicide. Warning signs of suicidal behavior in children include: Many depressive symptoms (changes in eating, sleeping, activities, or restlessness/agitation) Social isolation Talk of suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Increased acting-out of undesirable behaviors (sexual/behavioral) Increased risk-taking behaviors Frequent accidents Substance abuse Focus on morbid and negative themes Talk about death and dying Increased crying or reduced emotional expression Giving away possessions As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability, and biochemical disturbance. Children with a family history of depression are at greater risk of experiencing depression themselves. Children who have parents that suffer from depression tend to develop their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents do not. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression. If symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks, you should schedule a visit with his or her health care provider to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to ensure that your child receives proper treatment. If your child's health care provider suspects depression, he or she will recommend you take your child to see a mental health care professional, typically either a psychiatrist or a psychologist. There are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression, but clinical interviews conducted by trained and experienced mental health professionals along with tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful. Information from teachers, friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medicine. The role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. Your child's health care provider may suggest psychotherapy first, and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if symptoms are especially severe or if there is not significant improvement from psychotherapy alone. Currently, there are no good studies documenting the effectiveness of medicine over psychotherapy in children. However, studies do show that the antidepressant Fluoxetine ( Prozac) is effective in treating depression in children and teens. The drug is officially recognized by the FDA for treatment of children ages 8 to18 with depression. Other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) are used, as well. Most medications used to treat depression in children have a black box warning about increasing suicidal thoughts. It is important to start and monitor these medications under the care of a trained professional. Studies have found that first-time depression in children is occurring at younger ages than previously. As in adults, it may occur again later in life. Depression often occurs at the same time as other physical illnesses. And because studies have shown that depression may precede more serious mental illness later in life, diagnosis, early treatment and close monitoring are crucial. As a parent, it is sometimes easier to deny that your child has depression. You may put off seeking the help of a mental health care professional because of the social stigmas associated with mental illness. It is very important for you -- as the parent -- to understand depression and realize the importance of treatment so that your child may continue to grow physically and emotionally in a healthy way. It is also important to seek education about the future effects depression may have on your child throughout adolescence and adulthood. If you are a parent of a teenager, you are aware of the challenges involved, especially when it comes to communicating. Here are some tips to make communicating with your teenager easier: When disciplining your child, replace shame and punishment with positive reinforcement for good behavior. Shame and punishment can make an adolescent feel worthless and inadequate. Allow your teenager to make mistakes. Overprotection or making decisions for teens can be perceived as a lack of faith in their abilities. This can make them feel less confident. Give your teen breathing room. Don't expect them to do exactly as you say all of the time. Do not force your child down a path you wanted to follow. Avoid trying to relive your youth through your child's activities and experiences. If you suspect that your child or teenager is depressed, take the time to listen to his or her concerns. Even if you don't think the problem is of real concern, remember that it may feel very real to them. It is important to keep the lines of communication open, even if your child seems to want to withdraw. Try to avoid telling your child what to do. Instead, listen closely and you may discover more about the issues causing the problems. If you feel overwhelmed or unable to reach your child, or if you continue to be concerned, seek help from a qualified health care professional."
143,"When it comes to feeding your baby, breast milk is always best. It contains all of the nutrients your baby needs to grow, along with substances that help boost baby's immune system and protect against infections. But sometimes babies have trouble nursing or need extra nutrition. In those cases, your doctor might recommend adding formula or fortifying your breast milk. Any baby who is born before the 37th week of pregnancy is called ""premature"" or ""preterm."" These babies are usually smaller than a full-term baby and have special feeding needs. The more premature a baby is, the more help he or she will need to eat. Babies who are born before 34 weeks may not be able yet to suck and swallow milk from their mother's breast. To start, they may be fed through a vein. They'll get a fluid mix that contains sugar, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals to help them grow. As babies get bigger, they can take breast milk or formula through a small tube inserted through their nose or mouth into their stomach. This is called gavage feeding. Babies who are born early have more trouble suckling and swallowing -- actions that they need to master so they can nurse. Sometimes even full-term babies can't quite latch on to their mother's breast. If the baby is having trouble nursing, you can pump breast milk or supplement with formula. To feed a baby who can't latch on to the breast, you can use a bottle, spoon, medicine cup, or syringe. Your doctor might also recommend supplementing breast milk with formula or switching over to formula if your baby is in one of these situations: Low blood sugar Dehydrated Loses too much body weight Has a high level of jaundice Can't get enough nutrition because he's not nursing well or you aren't producing enough milk Many premature babies can tolerate breast milk. In fact, it's an ideal source of nutrition. Yet for babies who are born very small, breast milk might not be enough. Here are a few other feeding options your doctor might recommend. Fortifiers. Babies who are premature or born at a very low weight -- less than 3 1/2 pounds -- may need extra nutrition. To make sure your baby is growing quickly enough, your doctor might recommend adding a liquid or powdered fortifier to breast milk. Fortifiers contain: Extra calories Vitamins Protein Minerals Preterm formulas. For babies who were born early and aren't able to breast-feed, doctors often recommend a formula made specially for premature babies. These formulas are higher in calories than breast milk. They also contain: Extra protein Vitamins Minerals Special formulas. Babies who are allergic to milk proteins may need a special formula that contains broken-down versions of these proteins. There are also formulas for babies who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients from food. While the baby is getting supplemental feedings, it's a good idea for mom to pump her breast milk so she can start nursing as soon as her baby is ready. Once baby's growth has caught up, she may be able to switch him to breast milk."
144,"Coronary artery disease, also called coronary or atherosclerotic heart disease, is a serious condition caused by a buildup of plaque in your coronary arteries, the blood vessels that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. It affects millions of Americans. Your arteries are smooth and elastic. But when plaque builds up on their inner walls, it can make them become stiff and narrow. This slows blood flow to your heart muscle, so it doesn't get the oxygen it needs. The plaque could break off, leading to a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. Plaque can start to collect along your blood vessel walls when you're young and build up as you get older. That buildup inflames those walls and raises the risk of blood clots and heart attacks. The plaque makes the inner walls of your blood vessels sticky. Things like inflammatory cells, lipoproteins, and calcium attach to the plaque as they travel through your bloodstream.  More of these materials build up, along with cholesterol. That pushes your artery walls out while making them narrower. Eventually, a narrowed coronary artery may develop new blood vessels that go around the blockage to get blood to your heart muscle. But if you're pushing yourself or stressed out, the new arteries may not be able to bring enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart. In some cases, when plaque breaks, a blood clot may block blood supply to your heart muscle. This causes a heart attack. If a blood vessel to your brain is blocked, usually by a blood clot, you can have an ischemic stroke. If a blood vessel in your brain bursts, you might have a hemorrhagic stroke. These are usually brought on by high blood pressure. Studies have found that taking low-dose aspirin each day could help prevent heart attacks and strokes in some people who are 50 or older and at risk for heart disease. Talk with your doctor about whether you should take low-dose aspirin. There are many risk factors for coronary artery disease. Some you can change, and some you can't. Age, especially being older than 65 Being overweight or obese Diabetes Family history, especially if one of your close relatives got heart disease at a young age Gender. Men have a greater risk of heart attack and have them earlier, compared with women, until the risk evens out at age 70. High blood pressure and high cholesterol High stress Lack of physical activity Race. African- Americans have a higher risk than people of other races because they tend to have higher blood pressure. Higher rates of obesity and diabetes in some Asian and Hispanic people may also put them at higher risk of heart disease. Smoking or breathing secondhand smoke Unhealthy diet, including a lot of food that has high saturated fat, trans fat, salt, and sugar The most common symptom is angina, or chest pain. People describe angina as a: Aching Burning Fullness Heaviness Numbness Pressure Squeezing You might mistake it for indigestion or heartburn. You usually feel angina in your chest, but you might feel it in your: Arms Back Jaw Neck Shoulder Symptoms are often subtler in women. Nausea, sweating, fatigue, or shortness of breath can join the typical pressure-like chest pain. Other symptoms of coronary artery disease include: Faster heartbeat Nausea Palpitations (irregular heartbeats, skipped beats, or a ""flip-flop"" feeling in your chest) Shortness of breath Sweating Weakness or dizziness Cardiac ischemia is when plaque and fatty matter narrow the inside of your artery so much, it can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart. This can cause heart attacks -- with or without chest pain and other symptoms. Ischemia happens most during: Eating Excitement or stress Exercise or other exertion Exposure to cold Coronary artery disease can get to a point where ischemia happens even when you're resting. This is a medical emergency and may lead to a heart attack. If this happens to you, call your doctor or go to the emergency room. Ischemia can happen without warning in anyone with heart disease, although it is more common in people with diabetes. Your doctor can tell if you have coronary artery disease after: They learn your symptoms, medical history, and risk factors. They do a physical exam. You might also get diagnostic tests so your doctor can find the extent of your coronary artery disease and its effect on your heart. This helps them choose the best treatment for you. These tests include: Cardiac catheterization Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram ( EKG) Electron beam (ultrafast) CT scan Exercise stress tests Treatments can involve: Lifestyle changes. If you smoke, quit. Eat less processed food, and change to a low-trans-fat, low-salt, and low-sugar diet. Keep your blood sugar in control if you have diabetes. Exercise regularly (but talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program). Medications . If lifestyle changes aren't enough, you might need medication. The drugs you'll take depend on your situation. If you've been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you'll probably take aspirin and a drug to lower your cholesterol called a statin, if not other things. Research shows that the drug evolocumab ( Repatha) also lowers the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with cardiovascular disease. Surgery and other procedures. Common ones to treat coronary artery disease include: Balloon angioplasty Coronary artery bypass surgery Stent placement All of these treatments boost blood supply to your heart, but they can't cure coronary artery disease. Doctors are also studying innovative ways to treat heart disease, including: Angiogenesis. For this treatment, you'll get stem cells and other genetic material through your vein or directly into your damaged heart tissue. It helps new blood vessels grow and go around the clogged ones. EECP (enhanced external counterpulsation). People who have chronic angina but haven't gotten any help from nitrate medications or don't qualify for some procedures may find relief with this. It's an outpatient procedure -- one where you won't need to be admitted to the hospital -- that uses cuffs on the legs that inflate and deflate to boost blood supply to your coronary arteries. Complications of coronary artery disease include: Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), when your heartbeat loses its regular rhythm because of damage to your heart or a lack of blood supply. The most common form is called atrial fibrillation ( AFib). These rhythm problems can cause heart failure or make it worse. An irregular heartbeat might lead to blood clots in your heart, and these can cause a stroke if they reach your brain. Heart attack, when your coronary artery is totally blocked, keeping part of your heart muscle from getting enough oxygen. When blood flow to your heart muscle is blocked, your doctor might call it acute coronary syndrome. Heart failure, when your heart becomes too weak to supply your body with the blood it needs. This can be because your heart isn't getting enough oxygen and nutrients or it was damaged by a heart attack. It's important to know your heart disease symptoms and what causes them. Call your doctor if you feel new symptoms or if the ones you're used to become more frequent or severe. Call 911 if you or someone you're with has chest pain, especially when it comes with things like shortness of breath, heart palpitations, dizziness, a fast heartbeat, nausea, or sweating. If you're taking nitroglycerin for chest pain, call 911 if you're still feeling pain after two doses (at 5-minute intervals) or after 15 minutes. Emergency workers may tell you to chew an aspirin to help keep a blood clot from forming or getting larger."
145,"Without warning and, for some reason, in the middle of the night, gout strikes -- an intense pain in a joint, most often the big toe, but sometimes other joints, including knees, ankles, elbows, thumbs, or fingers. Attacks of gout can be unexpected and excruciatingly painful. With prompt treatment, the pain and inflammation usually disappear after a few days, but they may recur at any time. More than 8 million Americans suffer from gout. Gout occurs more often in men than in women. Men usually develop it between the ages of 30 and 50. Women are more prone to gout after menopause, and it is rare in children and young adults. Men who are overweight or suffering from high blood pressure are particularly prone to gout, especially if they are taking thiazide diuretics (water pills). Gout is actually a form of arthritis. It is the body's reaction to irritating crystal deposits in the joints. The pain can be intense, but treatment usually works very well. Mild cases may be controlled by diet alone. Recurring attacks of gout may require long-term medication to prevent damage to bone and cartilage and deterioration of the kidneys. Chronic gout sufferers may feel tiny, hard lumps accumulating over time in the soft flesh of areas such as the hands, elbows, feet, or earlobes. These deposits, called tophi, are concentrations of uric acid crystals and can cause pain and stiffness over time. If similar deposits form in the kidneys, they can lead to painful and potentially dangerous kidney stones. An excess of uric acid in the blood brings on gout. Uric acid comes from two places -- produced by the body and from the diet. Any extra uric acid usually filters through the kidneys and gets passed in urine. If the body produces too much uric acid or fails to excrete it in the urine, crystals of monosodium urate form in the joints and tendons. These crystals cause intense inflammation leading to pain swelling and redness. What exactly causes gout to occur when it does? The most common factor that increases your chance of gout and gout attacks is excess consumption of alcohol, especially beer. It used to be known as ""the disease of kings"" since it was mainly seen in wealthy men who drank and ate too much. Now we know it can occur in anyone and can be associated with injury or surgical procedures, hospitalizations, periods of stress, or reactions to diets high in meat and seafood, and certain drugs such as antibiotics. Gout may also occur in the presence of some tumors or cancers. There is also a relation between gout and kidney disorders, enzyme deficiencies, and lead poisoning. Gout may also accompany psoriasis and is common in patients with transplanted organs due to medications that are often needed. Susceptibility to gout is often inherited and is often associated with other common illnesses such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Repeat attacks of gout are common if the body's uric acid level is not kept under control. Pseudogout is a similar but generally less painful condition caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints. While it can affect the large toe, it is more commonly seen in larger joints such as the knee, wrist, or ankle. More common after age 60 in both sexes, pseudogout is treated with anti-inflammatory agents."
146," There's a type of cyst you can get at the bottom of your tailbone, or coccyx. It's called a pilonidal cyst, and it can become infected and filled with pus. Once infected, the technical term is âpilonidal abscess,â and it can be painful. It looks like a large pimple at the bottom of your tailbone. It is more common in men than in women. It usually happens more often in younger people. People who sit a lot, such as truck drivers, have a higher chance of getting one. They can be treated. If your cyst becomes a problem, your doctor can drain it or take it out through surgery. Most doctors think that ingrown hairs are the reason for many of them. Pilonidal means ""nest of hair,"" and doctors sometimes find hair follicles inside the cyst. Another theory is that pilonidal cysts appear after a trauma to that region of your body. During World War II, more than 80,000 soldiers got pilonidal cysts that put them in the hospital. People thought they were because of irritation from riding in bumpy Jeeps. For a while, the condition was called "" Jeep disease."" You might be more likely to get one if you were born with a small dimple in the skin between your buttocks. This dimple can tend to get infected, though doctors aren't exactly sure why. Other risk factors include obesity, large amounts of hair, not enough exercise, prolonged sitting, and excessive sweating. The symptoms of a pilonidal cyst include: Pain, redness, and swelling at the bottom of the spine Pus or blood draining out of it Bad smell from the pus Tenderness to the touch Fever They can vary in size. Yours may be a small dimple or cover a large, painful area. A pilonidal cyst is an abscess or boil. Treatment may include antibiotics, hot compresses and topical treatment with depilatory creams. In more severe cases it needs to be drained, or lanced, to heal. Like other boils, it does not get better with antibiotics. If you have any of the symptoms, call your doctor. Your doctor can diagnose a pilonidal cyst with a physical exam and by asking you questions about it. Among the things he may ask you: When did you first feel symptoms? Have you had this problem before? Have you had a fever? What medications or supplements do you take? Early in the infection of a pilonidal cyst, the redness, swelling, and pain may not be too bad. Some things you might want to try: To ease any pain, soak in a tub of warm water. Sometimes, your cyst may open and drain on its own this way. Take nonprescription pain medicine, but follow the dosing instructions. Keep the cyst and area around it clean and dry. Antibiotics do not heal a pilonidal cyst. But doctors have any number of procedures they can try. Here are some options: Incision and drainage: This is the preferred method for a first pilonidal cyst. Your doctor makes a cut into the cyst and drains it. He removes any hair follicles and leaves the wound open, packing the space with gauze. Advantage -- It's a simple procedure done under local anesthesia, meaning just the area around the cyst is numbed. Disadvantage -- You have to change the gauze often until the cyst heals, which sometimes takes up to 3 weeks. Marsupialization: In this procedure, your doctor makes a cut and drains the cyst, removing pus and any hair that are inside. He'll sew the edges of the cut to the wound edges to make a pouch. Advantages -- This is outpatient surgery under local anesthesia. It also lets the doctor make a smaller, shallower cut so that you don't need to take out and repack gauze daily. Disadvantages -- It takes about 6 weeks to heal, and you need a doctor specially trained in the technique. Incision, drainage, closing of wound: In this technique, the cyst is drained, but it's not left open. Advantage -- You don't need to pack gauze because your doctor fully closes the wound right after surgery. Disadvantages -- You're more likely to have more problems with the cyst down the road. It's harder to remove the entire cyst with this method. It's usually done in an operating room with a specially trained surgeon.' Other surgical procedures include complete cyst and cyst wall excision along with the pilonidal sinus tracts, the use of fibrin glue, and taking (core out) only diseased tissue and the cyst out with punch biopsies. Follow all of your doctor's instructions about at-home care, especially if you need to remove and pack gauze. Other tips: Try to keep the area clean. Check for any signs of a new infection, such as redness, pus, or pain. Keep your follow-up appointments with your doctor so he can see how your cyst is healing. A complete cure is possible, but remember that a pilonidal cyst may recur even if you had one surgically removed."
147,"Leukemia is usually thought of as a children's condition, but it actually affects more adults. It's more common in men than women, and more in whites than African- Americans. There's really nothing you can do to prevent leukemia. It's cancer of your blood cells caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. They crowd out the red blood cells and platelets your body needs to be healthy. All those extra white blood cells don't work right, and that causes problems. Blood has three types of cells: white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen, and platelets that help blood to clot. Every day, billions of new blood cells are made in the bone marrow -- most of them red cells. But when you have leukemia, your body makes more white cells than it needs. There are two main types of white blood cells in your body: lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. Leukemia can happen in either type. These leukemia cells can't fight infection the way normal white blood cells do. And because there are so many of them, they start to affect the way your major organs work. Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia. People who have it have certain abnormal chromosomes, but the chromosomes don't cause the leukemia. You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year. The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are. But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over. Biologic therapy, also called immunotherapy, helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells. Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor. First you'll have high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your bone marrow. Then you'll get the new stem cells through an infusion into one of your veins. They will grow into new, healthy blood cells. Surgery. Your doctor can remove your spleen if it is filled with cancer cells and is pressing on nearby organs. This procedure is called splenectomy."
148,"Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). Exactly how many people are affected is hard to know because it often has no symptoms.  Many people who get myocarditis are otherwise healthy. Many things can lead to it. The best ways to prevent it are to treat infections quickly and stop them from happening. Viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis. When you have one, your body produces cells to fight it. These cells release chemicals. If the disease-fighting cells enter your heart, some chemicals they release can inflame your heart muscle. Some things that can cause myocarditis include: Coxsackie B viruses Epstein- Barr virus ( EBV) Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) Hepatitis C Herpes HIV Parvovirus Chlamydia (a common sexually transmitted disease) Mycoplasma (bacteria that cause a lung infection) Streptococcal (strep) bacteria Staphylococcal (staph) bacteria Treponema (the cause of syphilis) Borrelia (the cause of Lyme disease) Fungal and parasitic infections can also cause it. Other causes include certain chemicals or allergic reactions to medications or toxins like: Alcohol Drugs Lead Spider bites Wasp stings Snakebites Chemotherapy and radiation therapy An autoimmune disease that causes inflammation throughout your body, like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, may also lead to myocarditis. Myocarditis often has no symptoms. In fact, most people recover and never even know they had it. If you do have symptoms, they may include: Shortness of breath during exercise at first, then at night while lying down Abnormal heartbeat, which causes fainting in rare cases Light-headedness A sharp or stabbing chest pain or pressure, which may spread to your neck and shoulders Fatigue Signs of infection, such as Fever Muscle aches Sore throat Headache Diarrhea Painful joints Swollen joints, legs, or neck veins Small amounts of urine If you have symptoms like these, your doctor will check you for an abnormal or rapid heartbeat, fluid in your lungs, or leg swelling. To make sure it's myocarditis and spot causes, your doctor may order tests such as: Blood tests to check for infection, antibodies, or blood cell counts A chest X-ray so he can see your heart, lungs, and other chest structures An electrocardiogram ( EKG) to record your heart's electrical activity A heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) to make an image of your heart and its structures In a few cases, doctors order cardiac MRI scans or heart muscle biopsies to help confirm it. Call him right away if you have symptoms of myocarditis. If you have or had an infection, it's more likely that you have the condition. Seek immediate medical care if your symptoms are severe. If chest pain, trouble breathing, or swelling have gotten worse since you were told you have myocarditis, call 911 or go to the hospital. If you have myocarditis, your doctor will treat its cause, if possible. He'll also try to take the extra load off your heart, if needed, and take steps to prevent or control complications. Usually, you'll be prescribed medicines to help your heart work better. Examples include: ACE inhibitors Calcium channel blockers Diuretics Your doctor will also probably suggest rest or reduced activity for at least 6 months. He'll probably also put you on a low-salt diet to keep fluid from building up. You may be hospitalized if you have complications, like a blood clot or weakened heart. If abnormal heart rhythms are severe, you may need other medications, a pacemaker, or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD). Your outlook depends on: What causes your myocarditis Your overall health If you have complications You may recover completely. Or you may have a chronic condition. Either way, follow-up care can help keep track of any ongoing problems. It's also important to know that myocarditis can recur, although it's not common. If left untreated, myocarditis may lead to symptoms of heart failure, where your heart has trouble pumping blood the way it should. In rare cases, it leads to other problems, such as: Cardiomyopathy : The heart muscle weakens or the structure of the heart muscle changes. Pericarditis : Inflammation of the sac covering the heart (called the pericardium). Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are leading causes of heart transplants in the U. S. In very rare cases, myocarditis can lead to sudden death."
149,"Diabetes can mean double trouble for your feet. First, diabetes can reduce blood flow to your feet, depriving your feet of oxygen and nutrients. This makes it more difficult for blisters, sores, and cuts to heal. And second, the diabetic nerve damage called peripheral neuropathy can cause numbness in your feet. When you can't feel cuts and blisters, you're more likely to get sores and infections. If you don't notice or treat the sores, they can become deeply infected, and lead to amputation. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also cause sharp pain in your feet. You may become excruciatingly sensitive to the lightest touch, like the sheets on your bed. Fortunately, a little TLC goes a long way in preventing foot problems from diabetes. Look over both feet carefully every day, and be sure you check between all of your toes. Blisters and infections can start between your toes, and with diabetic neuropathy, you may not feel them until they've become irritated or infected. If a physical challenge keeps you from checking your own feet, ask a family member to help. Wash both of your feet briefly each day with warm -- not hot -- water. You may not be able to feel heat with your feet, so test the water with your hands first. Avoid soaking too long in water, since waterlogged sores have a harder time healing. Dry your feet right away, and remember to dry gently between all of your toes. It's an investment worth making. Even the slightest rubbing or misfit shoe can cause a blister that turns into a sore that becomes infected and never heals. Buy better-fitting shoes, or try different socks, even at the most minor signs of redness or irritation, since you may not be able to feel when it's getting worse. Before buying or putting on the shoes check your shoes for rough seams, sharp edges or other objects that could hurt your feet. And break your shoes in gradually. Always wear shoes or slippers. Always wear socks with your shoes, since leather, plastics, and manmade shoe materials can irritate your skin and quickly bring on blisters. While you might prefer the look of hose, nylon knee-highs, or thin socks, you may find that these don't give your toes or heels enough protection. Wear thicker socks to pad your feet and cushion any calluses or sore spots. Nerve damage can be unpredictable. Tell your doctor about any changes in sensation in your toes, feet, or legs. Speak up if you notice pain, tingling, a pins-and-needles feeling, numbness, or any other unusual signs -- even if it seems trivial to you. There's nothing small-potatoes about a potential foot amputation. Your skin may be dry and cracked because of high glucose levels, and cracked skin means it's easier for bacteria to get under your skin and harder for infections to heal. Use a small amount of skin lotion daily, but be sure your feet feel dry, not damp or sticky, afterward. Try not to get the lotion in between your toes. Keep your toenails trimmed and filed smooth to avoid ingrown toenails. You may find it easier to trim your nails after using lotion, when your cuticles are softer. Use a pumice stone after showering or bathing to softly file corns or calluses. Swimming, cycling, yoga, and tai chi are increasingly popular ways to exercise -- with minimal impact on your feet. Talk with your doctor before starting an exercise program. If your big toe slants sharply in toward your other toes, with a big bump on the knuckle of your big toe, you've got a classic bunion. Corns are spots of thick, rough skin, where the tissue builds up on toes constantly barraged by too much rubbing or pressure. A buckled-under toe, called a hammertoe, can result from muscle weakness caused by diabetic nerve damage. All of these make it hard to fit shoes comfortably. A good podiatrist can help you fix these problems and take better care of your feet. A podiatrist can also fit you with shoe inserts called orthotics to support your feet if your have diabetic nerve pain or the muscles have become weak from nerve damage. If pain or weakness is so severe that it's too painful or even impossible to walk, a foot brace or orthopedic shoes might help. A podiatrist is your best source for these devices. The best prevention for nerve pain, ultimately, is to manage your diabetes well. In fact, a 2006 study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases showed that strict blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy lowered the chances in people with type I (insulin requiring) diabetes of having symptoms of peripheral neuropathy -- tingling, burning, and pain -- by 64%. These results have also been shown to hold true in type II diabetes, too. The two most important determinants of whether you get diabetic neuropathy are how many years you have had diabetes and how well you control your blood sugar. Other factors, including controlling blood pressure and blood fats (cholesterol and triglycerides) and not smoking are also important to prevent diabetic neuropathy. Controlling your blood glucose also helps reduce the symptoms of diabetic nerve pain. So the good news is that controlling your glucose levels with diet, exercise, and if needed, medications can not only help prevent diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but they can also help ease its effects. Your feet are your source of independence, or at least its foundation. Give your feet a little tenderness, a little loving care, each day. And be sure to have your doctor take a good look at your feet during each of your diabetes checkups in case you've missed anything."
150,"Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) is a method of pain control that gives patients the power to control their pain. In PCA, a computerized pump called the patient-controlled analgesia pump, which contains a syringe of pain medication as prescribed by a doctor, is connected directly to a patient's intravenous ( IV) line. In some cases, the pump is set to deliver a small, constant flow of pain medication. Additional doses of medication can be self-administered as needed by having the patient press a button. Other times, a patient can control when he or she receives pain medication and does not receive a constant flow. Patients recovering from surgery often are equipped with PCA pumps. The machines also can be used by people coping with other kinds of pain. Children who are 4 to 6 years old may be able to use PCA with the help of a parent or nurse. Many children who are as young as 6 can independently use the PCA pump. The pump can be used whenever the patient is feeling pain. However, patients should not press the button on the machine if they are feeling too sleepy. The more alert the patient is, the more likely he or she is to participate in a therapy program to aid and possibly shorten recovery. Once the acute pain from surgery is controlled, the patient will be switched to pills for pain relief. PCA pumps have built-in safety features. The total amount of analgesic (pain reliever) that the patient can self administer is within a safe limit."
151,"For a long time, doctors thought of asthma as just one disease. But they now realize there's more to the story. They've started to think of asthma like a collection of conditions, with differences such as what age you start to have it, what symptoms you get, and how to best treat it. That's where eosinophilic asthma comes in. It's what doctors call a subtype of asthma. Researchers are still working out how to define these subtypes, and it's important work because it may lead to different, more effective treatments. Until very recently, eosinophilic asthma meant more frequent asthma attacks and a lower quality of life. But an understanding of subtypes has led to new medicines that are quickly changing that picture. Eosinophilic asthma is a rare type of asthma. It's often severe and usually comes on in adults. The main treatment for asthma -- drugs called inhaled corticosteroids -- don't have much of an effect on it, even in high doses. That means it's harder to manage and you're more likely to have asthma attacks. Usually, you need to take corticosteroid pills, which can have more side effects than an inhaler. Several biologics are approved to reduce the frequency of eosinophilic asthma attacks. These include: Benralizumab ( Fasenra) Mepolizumab ( Nucala) Reslizumab ( Cinqair) Your respiratory system is your body's system for breathing. It goes from your nose and mouth down to the tiniest airways in your lungs. When you have eosinophilic asthma, you have inflammation in your respiratory system caused by cells called eosinophils. Eosinophils are white blood cells. They're part of your body's immune system, and normally, they help you fight disease. One of their jobs is to help cause swelling. That may sound odd, but swelling is one of your body's key tools in fighting germs. But too much swelling can cause problems. More and more, doctors are coming to see that there's really no such thing as âregular asthma.â But something like classic, childhood asthma may look like this: Comes on when you're a kid Often gets triggered by an allergen, like pet dander or dust mites Causes swelling in the airways, and symptoms like wheezing and trouble breathing Responds well to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids When you look at eosinophilic asthma, it: Tends to come on in adults Isn't usually caused by allergies -- people who get it tend not to have allergies Causes swelling in your entire respiratory system May not seem like asthma at first because the main symptom may involve shortness of breath rather than wheezing Doesn't respond well to inhaled corticosteroids, even at high doses Doctors don't actually know what causes eosinophilic asthma. There also aren't any clear things, like foods or amount of exercise, that make you more likely to get it. What they do know is that it usually comes on in adults ages 35-50 with no allergies. Sometimes it happens in older adults, and kids can get it too, but that's not as common. And while adult asthma usually affects more women than men, eosinophilic asthma affects them at about the same rate."
152,"If you're feeling numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand, consider asking your doctor to check you for carpal tunnel syndrome. It's caused by pressure on your median nerve, which runs the length of the arm, goes through a passage in the wrist called the carpal tunnel, and ends in the hand. The median controls the movement and feeling of your thumb, and also the movement of all your fingers except your pinky. The carpal tunnel is narrowed as a result, usually from swelling. Often, people don't know what brought on their carpal tunnel syndrome. But it can happen due to: Repetitive motions, like typing or any motions of the wrist that you do over and over. This is especially true of actions when your hands are lower than your wrist. Conditions like hypothyroidism, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes Pregnancy If you have carpal tunnel syndrome and don't get it treated, its symptoms can last a long time, get worse, and can even go away and return. When your doctor diagnoses it early, it's easier to treat. You may feel a burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of your hand and thumb, or index and middle fingers. You might first notice that your fingers ""fall asleep"" and become numb at night. That usually happens in the evening because of the relaxed position of your hand and while sleeping. In the morning, you may wake up with numbness and tingling in your hands that may run all the way to your shoulder. As carpal tunnel syndrome becomes more severe, you may have less grip strength because the muscles in your hand shrink. Pain and muscle cramping will also become worse. The median nerve begins to lose function because of the irritation or pressure around it. This leads to: Slower nerve impulses Loss of feeling in the fingers A loss of strength and coordination, especially the ability to use your thumb to pinch You could end up with permanent muscle damage and lose function in your hand. So, don't put off seeing a doctor. Medical conditions sometimes linked to carpal tunnel syndrome include: Obesity Hypothyroidism Rheumatoid Arthritis Diabetes Pregnancy Trauma Women are three times more likely than men to get the condition. That may be because in general they have a smaller carpal tunnel than men. When the condition is brought on by pregnancy, the symptoms usually clear up within a few months after delivery. Certain jobs that involve repeating the same motion with your arm over a long time may raise your chances of getting the condition. Those jobs include: Assembly line worker Sewer or knitter Baker Cashier Hair stylist Musician Your doctor may ask you to tap the palm side of your wrist or fully flex your wrist with your arms completely extended. Another test called EMG- NCV measures the function of the nerve across the carpal tunnel. Lifestyle changes. If your symptoms are due to repetitive motion, you can take more frequent breaks or do a bit less of the activity that's causing you pain. Certain stretching and strengthening exercises could help, too. Speak with your doctor. Immobilization. The doctor may have you use a splint to keep your wrist from moving and to lessen pressure on the nerves. You may wear one at night to help get rid of that numbness or tingling feeling. This can help you sleep better and give your median nerve a rest. Medication . Your doctor may give you anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid shots to reduce swelling. Surgery. If none of the above treatments work, an operation may be an option. Talk with your doctor about it. Keep your wrists straight. Use a splint or brace that helps keep your wrist in a neutral position. Avoid flexing and extending your wrists repeatedly. Talk to your doctor about exercises that may help. Correctly position your hands and wrists while working. Arrange your activity and workspace in a way that minimizes any discomfort."
153,"When you have psoriasis, it's important to follow the advice of your doctor. Still, you can do a lot on your own to help control and prevent flare-ups. Symptoms get worse when your skin is dry, so keep it moist with creams and lotions. Thick and oily ones, like petroleum jelly, are usually best. They're better at trapping moisture beneath the skin. To help remove scales, apply cream on top of them, then cover the area with plastic wrap or another waterproof material. Leave it on for a few hours, then remove. Be careful with your skin. Never pick at patches or scales, as you may make your psoriasis worse. Use caution when trimming your nails. If you cut yourself, it might make symptoms flare. If you have psoriasis on your scalp, rub your topical treatments -- such as tar shampoos -- into your scalp. Regular bathing with soothing products, such as tar solutions, may bring relief, too. Climate can have a big effect on psoriasis. For many people, cold, dry weather makes symptoms worse. Hot weather usually makes it better, but not always. It's important to keep your skin moist. Turn on the humidifier when the air inside your house is dry. Let your doctor know about all the medications you take, even over-the-counter ones. Ask if they could affect your psoriasis. Drugs that are known to make things worse include: Lithium , used to treat psychiatric disorders Propranolol and possibly other beta-blockers, which are prescribed for heart conditions Quinidine ( Cardioquin or Quinidex), medications for heart arrhythmias If you're using any of these medications, ask your doctor about substitutes. It's extra important for people with psoriasis to avoid bumps and cuts. Trauma to the skin can cause a flare, a condition called "" Koebner's phenomenon."" Infections can also cause problems. Be especially careful when shaving. Avoid acupuncture, tattoos, and do your best to prevent insect bites and chafing. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells, so getting moderate doses of sun is good. But make it brief -- about 20 minutes or so at a time. And use sunscreen. Sunburn can trigger psoriasis, and it raises your risk of skin cancer. Some medications can make your skin more sensitive to ultraviolet rays, so talk to your doctor first. Although it hasn't been proven, many people link flare-ups to stress. So, try to relieve your anxiety. That may be easier said than done, but you can try relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, for starters. The connection between alcohol and psoriasis isn't clear, but some think it can worsen symptoms, especially in men. Alcohol can be dangerous if you're using certain psoriasis drugs, so check with your doctor. Although no studies have shown a link between diet and psoriasis, experts recommend that people with the condition eat a well-balanced diet that's high in fruits and vegetables. Some people say their symptoms improve when they remove dairy or gluten. Exercise may also help. Some studies show excess weight can trigger flares, so stay at a healthy weight."
154,"While you may not be able to avoid the pain that comes with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), you can take action to limit it. Start with these eight ideas: Take your pain medication on a schedule and as prescribed. Don't wait until you are in more pain and have to play ""catch-up."" Use a warm, moist compress to loosen up a stiff joint. Try an ice pack on an inflamed joint. Massage may also help. These tried-and-true treatments are easy and can provide some quick relief for mild symptoms. Make it a priority every day to relax. If you need ideas for healthy ways to manage stress, ask your doctor or a counselor. You may want to try meditation, too. Focus on things you enjoy. Join a support group. It's a great place to talk with people who know what you are going through because they are, too. Exercise. It will make your joints feel better, not worse. Even if you're in pain, there are some exercises you can do. Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about what's best for you. Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Don't turn to âcomfort food,â cigarettes, or alcohol. Consider talking to a counselor. These professionals are a great source of support. They can help you look for new solutions to make your life better."
155,"Bones, lungs, and the liver are the most common places for cancer cells to spread, or ""metastasize."" Once in the bone, these cancer cells can form new metastatic tumors. Do you then have bone cancer? No. You still have the type of cancer you were diagnosed with, except now it is metastatic. For example, breast cancer that spreads is known as ""metastatic breast cancer."" Metastatic cancers in the bone are also called bone metastases, or bone ""mets."" Here are the types of cancer that are most likely to metastasize to the bone and what treatments can provide relief. Bone metastasis is more likely with cancers such as: Breast Prostate Lung Kidney Thyroid About three out of four cases of bone metastasis result from tumors in the breast, prostate, lung, or kidney. Almost 70% of people with advanced breast or prostate cancer have bone metastasis; bone is commonly the first area of metastasis for these cancers. The spread of cancer to bone is a complex process that doctors are just beginning to understand. Metastasis typically involves the following process: Cancer cells invade normal tissue nearby, then move through the walls of nearby lymph or blood vessels and begin circulating through the lymphatic system and bloodstream to reach other parts of the body. After stopping in small blood vessels at a further location, they invade the blood vessel walls and migrate into surrounding tissue where they multiply and form smaller tumors. Those new tumors need a blood supply for continued growth, so they stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. Once they've reached the bone, cancer cells must avoid attacks from the body's immune system. So they may go through more changes. This means the new tumor may be somewhat different from the primary tumor. This can make it more difficult to treat. The type of cancer may have something to do with why tumors form in bones. Certain cancers may release proteins that affect how a tumor forms. Bones provide fertile ground for the growth of tumor cells, because they are areas of constant cell turnover and growth. And bone cells release substances that may prompt faster cancer growth. Cancer cells may also attach better to bone than to other substances in the body for some reason. Cancer cells can go anywhere, but they often go to the bones with the greatest blood supply. This includes bones in the: Spine Pelvis Ribs Upper arms Thighs In some cases, areas of bone are destroyed (osteolytic). In other cases, new bone may form in response to bone metastasis (osteoblastic). In many cases of cancer such as breast cancer, either - or both -- bone destruction and new bone formation may occur. Bone mets symptoms include: Bone pain Broken bones, as a result of weakening from the metastasis Loss of appetite, nausea, extreme thirst, and other symptoms from excess calcium in the blood; as bone becomes destroyed by the metastatic tumor, the bone releases calcium into the bloodstream. Compression of the spinal cord if cancer in a bone of the spine grows and puts pressure on the spinal cord; this can cause nerve symptoms of numbness, weakness, urinary problems, and paralysis. Most bone metastasis cannot be cured. But treatment can often help relieve symptoms. The kind of treatment your doctor recommends depends, in part, on what kind of primary cancer you have. Other factors include: Which bones the cancer has invaded Damage to the bones Which treatments you have already had Your state of health In most cases, doctors treat bone metastasis by treating the primary cancer. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy are examples of treatments commonly used to treat the primary cancer. These are systemic treatments, so they can travel through the bloodstream to reach different parts of the body. These treatments for the bone can help relieve bone metastasis pain and other symptoms: Radiation therapy. High-energy X-rays can kill cancer cells or slow their growth. Alone or combined with other treatments, this can relieve symptoms of bone mets. Radiopharmaceuticals. Used only for cancer that spreads to bone, these are drugs with radioactive elements. When they are injected, they go to the bone with cancer, killing cancer cells and helping to relieve pain. Low blood counts can be a side effect of this type of therapy. Ablation. In this method, a needle is put directly into a tumor to destroy it with heat, cold, electric current, or alcohol. MRI- Guided Focused Ultrasound. This is a noninvasive procedure that uses ultrasound energy guided by MRI scanning to destroy nerve endings in the area of the tumor. The procedure is used to relieve pain in people who have not had success with radiation or who are unable to be treated with radiation. Bisphosphonates ( Aredia and Zometa). Given intravenously ( IV) for bone mets, these drugs can reduce damage to the bone, lower the risk of breaks, reduce high blood calcium levels, and lessen pain. Denosumab ( Xgeva). Similar to bisphosphonates, this drug is injected to help keep bone from breaking down. Surgery. If bone damage is severe, inserting a supportive rod may be a good option. Other types of surgery may relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Injections of bone cement. These can also strengthen bones to prevent breaks. Your options for treatment of bone mets may vary depending on your type of cancer, your condition, and tolerance of possible side effects."
156,"Could immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment that uses your body's own immune system to fight tumors, help people with mesothelioma? Early research shows benefits for this hard-to-treat form of cancer. Mesothelioma often starts in your pleura, a thin lining between your lung and the inside of your chest. Usually, it affects people who've breathed in asbestos, a material used in roofing and insulation. Tiny asbestos fibers go into your lungs and cause cancer cells to grow in the lining. Right now, the only FDA-approved mesothelioma treatments are chemotherapy, like cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. Doctors are looking at other options, like immunotherapy, that could offer hope. Where Is Immunotherapy Now? Larger clinical trials with more mesothelioma patients will offer a better look at how well immunotherapy works and what side effects it can cause. These drugs are being studied for mesothelioma now: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Ipilimumab ( Yervoy) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) Tremelimumab How Does Immunotherapy Work? Unlike chemotherapy drugs, which kill both cancer and healthy cells, immunotherapy is more targeted. It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells. Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. They're called checkpoints. They distract your white blood cells so they don't attack the cancer inside. Checkpoint proteins include PD-1 and PD- L1. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense. Checkpoints normally act as an off switch for immune cells attacking tumor cells. Immunotherapy reveals the tumor cells. The checkpoint inhibitor pulls the mask off so the immune cells can do their job. When Is It Used? Mesothelioma is hard to treat because its tumor cells are high in checkpoints. So current trials test different mixes of immunotherapy drugs, as well as use of immunotherapy to rev up your immune system before cancer surgery. The results: People who've failed other treatments often respond well to immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is mainly given to people with mesothelioma in clinical trials.. So how and when do you know if you should sign up for one? Every trial is different. Each has its own requirements for who can enroll based on the type of mesothelioma you have and what treatments you've already tried that didn't work. You and your doctor can talk about immunotherapy when you're diagnosed and go over your treatment options. The type of mesothelioma you have and how far it has spread will help you decide if you should try chemotherapy or surgery first. Usually, you go into a drug trial if other treatments have failed. But some mesothelioma immunotherapy trials don't require that. How Do You Take Immunotherapy? These drugs are all given as infusions, so you go to a clinic to get an IV drip every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunotherapy can cause side effects including diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and inflamed organs. Next Steps Researchers want to find biomarkers, like genes or those proteins on the tumors, that could help immunotherapy drugs better hit their targets. Also, most people don't respond to a single drug, so scientists are looking into combinations with surgery, other cancer drugs, and other immunotherapies. More trials on more patients with mesothelioma may tell us how well they work in different types of this cancer, and why they seem to work when other drugs have failed. Doctors will go back and figure out why people had the response they did, whether it was partial or very good. One day, you might not have to wait until other treatments fail first to try immunotherapy. If things keep going the way they are, it could soon become a front-line treatment for mesothelioma."
157,"There is no specific test to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis, but imaging by X-ray and MRI may show evidence of inflammation of the sacroiliac joint between the sacrum (the triangular bone at the lowest part of the back) and the ilium (the bone felt on the upper part of the hip). Some symptoms may include: Inflammatory back pain (gradual in onset, lasting over three months, with stiffness and pain that is worse in the morning and improved with movement) Reduced mobility of the spine Reduced ability to expand the chest Your doctor may order a number of different blood tests that can suggest ankylosing spondylitis. For example, if you have the disorder, you are likely to have an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells settle out of your blood) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (a protein that is usually not in blood at high levels but may be elevated in cases of inflammation). These two tests are general indications of inflammation in your body. You may also have anemia. To exclude other causes of inflammatory arthritis, tests for rheumatoid factor (an antibody common in cases of rheumatoid arthritis) and anti-nuclear antibodies (common in cases of lupus and other similar conditions) may be ordered, which are usually negative in ankylosing spondylitis. Between 85-90% of Caucasian people with ankylosing spondylitis are positive for the HLA- B27 marker. If you are diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, it is important to seek help from a physical therapist. Regular exercise and efforts to maintain mobility may make the difference between preserving your movement and independence and becoming debilitated. Deep breathing exercises may help keep the chest cage flexible. Swimming is an excellent form of exercise for people with spondylitis, because it helps maintain proper extension of the spine. For smokers, it is advisable to quit due to the potential breathing problems associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Good posture is important. Patients should choose chairs, tables, and other work surfaces that will help them avoid slumped or stooped postures. Patients are encouraged to sleep on a hard mattress with their back straight. Do not sleep on several pillows with your neck flexed forward. Lying face down with the arms extended is an exercise to help maintain an erect posture. During flare-ups of the disease, and to control symptoms, you may need to take anti-inflammatory drugs. The drugs sulfasalazine and methotrexate may help some people with ankylosing spondylitis for symptoms in joints other than the spine. Biologic drugs also used for rheumatoid arthritis, including adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, certolizumab ( Cimzia), etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria), infliximab ( Remicade), and infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, as well as secukinimab ( Cosentyx), can significantly relieve inflammation and pain in many people with spondylitis if anti-inflammatory drugs aren't controlling symptoms. If you develop very severe arthritis of the hips, you may eventually need surgery to replace your hips. If you develop inflammation of the eye, you may be given steroid eye drops. There are no known ways to prevent ankylosing spondylitis. The condition is largely due to genetics, although you may not be aware of anyone in your family with similar symptoms."
158,"Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is key to helping prevent back pain. Excess weight puts a strain on the back, so maintaining a healthy weight is important. Regular exercise, especially core work, keeps the abdominal and back muscles firm. Smoking ages the spine, so avoid smoking and inhaling secondhand smoke. Practicing good posture is another way to help prevent back pain. First, analyze your posture by standing with your heels against a wall. Your calves, buttocks, shoulders, and the back of your head should touch the wall. You should be able to slip your hand behind the small of your back. Now step forward and stand normally. If your posture changes, correct it right away. If you stand for long periods at work, wear flat shoes with good arch support and get a box or step about 6 inches high to rest one foot on from time to time. Your sitting posture may be even more important. A good chair bottom supports your hips comfortably but doesn't touch the backs of your knees. Your chair back should be set at an angle of about 10 degrees and should cradle the small of your back comfortably. If necessary, use a wedge-shaped cushion or lumbar pad. Your feet should rest flat on the floor. Your forearms should rest on your desk or work surface with your elbows almost at a right angle. When you have to lift heavy objects, don't bend at the waist. Squat with your legs and keep your back upright as you grasp the object and stand upright again. Let your legs do the lifting, not your back. Finally, ask your doctor or health club trainer about back-strengthening exercises. You might also check with your local YMCA or hospital for back-strengthening classes. These stretching and strengthening exercises can help chronic back pain and prevent future episodes. Also, some forms of yoga and tai chi may help you learn proper posture and improve strength, balance, and flexibility."
159,"You want to calm the flares that strike when you have ulcerative colitis ( UC). And if you keep your disease in check, you may also have fewer symptoms over time. Your flares might be different from someone else's. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and are often unpredictable. You might get diarrhea and feel an urgent need to go to the bathroom. You could have blood in your stool and be tired a lot. Use these five tips to keep your flares in check. It can be easy to forget to take your medicines when you feel good. Or you might think it's OK to skip them because you feel fine. But you need to stick with the plan your doctor prescribed to keep up those benefits. Many people with UC stay on low doses of drugs such as 5- ASAs, which ease inflammation in the colon, or meds such as 6- MP and azathioprine, which turn down an overactive immune system. Some foods will make you feel bad. When you figure out which ones do, stay away from them. Some people have trouble with beans, bran, brown rice, dairy, fruit, popcorn, nuts, seeds, and vegetables. If you suspect that a food triggers your symptoms, avoid it for a while to see if you feel better. For more help, ask your doctor to recommend a dietitian or nutritionist. Food is not the only thing that causes UC symptoms. Other triggers include: Stress Infections Antibiotics Ibuprofen, naproxen, or other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications) It's hard to think about food when you have a flare-up. But you need to eat and drink fluids. If you don't, you could get dehydrated or miss nutrients you need. And you may have already been dehydrated when the flare started. Every flare is unique. Some people get mild diarrhea and bloating from time to time. For others, they can be very uncomfortable, with symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, belly pain, nausea, and fever. Call your doctor if the problem doesn't clear up within 48 hours. Together, you can make a plan so you know exactly what to do when your symptoms start next time. Your doctor can also check on your treatment plan or see if you need to take another medicine for a short time to help you get through your discomfort. Unless your doctor has OK'd it ahead of time, don't pick and choose your own treatment. Something you have in your medicine cabinet from a previous flare might have helped you in the past. But have those meds expired? And are they right for you this time? Check with your doctor first. It's not an immediate fix, and not everyone needs an operation to keep UC in check. But for some people, it can help. Your doctor might suggest surgery if you've had the condition for a long time, or if your flares are so severe that drugs no longer control them. An operation might help prevent colon cancer, which people with UC are more likely to get. There are two different types of procedures. Both surgeries remove the colon and rectum. Once those parts are gone, so are the pain, inflammation, and constant urges to go to the bathroom that happen during a flare. You'll still need to go often, but less than before. In one operation, the surgeon uses the end of your own small bowel to create a pouch connected to your anus on the inside of your body. ( You would temporarily need to wear a bag outside your body over the hole that your surgeon makes, until your body heals from the surgery and is ready for the internal pouch.) In the other procedure, the surgeon creates a small opening in the abdomen to collect waste in a removable pouch on the outside of the body. Your doctor can let you know if either operation would help you."
160,"One of the goals of asthma treatment is to help you maintain a normal and healthy lifestyle, which includes exercise and other physical activities. Taking your asthma medications as prescribed, avoiding triggers, and checking your symptoms and how well your lungs are working will help you achieve this goal. If asthma symptoms prevent you from fully taking part in activities, talk to your asthma doctor. A small change in your asthma action plan may be all that is needed to provide asthma relief during exercise or other activity. Yes, regular exercise can: Help your lungs work better Boost your immune system so you get fewer colds Help you lose weight, which can cut your odds of an asthma attack Create âfeel-goodâ chemicals in your body that hold of depression and stress. Team sports that involve short bursts of exertion -- like volleyball, gymnastics, baseball, and wrestling -- are good, and so are solo or group leisure activities like walking, biking, and hiking. Swimming is also a good choice because you usually breathe in plenty of warm, moist air while you do it. It's also a great way to build upper-body strength. Activities that involve long periods of exertion, such as soccer, distance running, basketball, and field hockey, may not be as easy. Also, cold-weather sports, such as ice hockey, cross-country skiing, and ice skating, may pose challenges. But many people with asthma are able to fully take part in these activities. Before starting an exercise program, talk to your doctor. He will help you decide what activities are best for you. He will come up with an action plan that will tell you what to do before exercise and if you have symptoms during exercise. Always use your pre-exercise asthma medicine (inhaled bronchodilators or cromolyn), if directed by your asthma action plan, before beginning exercise. Perform warm-up exercises, and have a good cool-down period after exercise. If the weather is cold, exercise indoors or wear a mask or scarf over your nose and mouth. If you have allergic asthma, avoid exercising outdoors when pollen counts or air pollution counts are high. Restrict exercise when you have a viral infection, like a cold. Exercise at a level that is right for you. Staying active is important for your physical and mental health. Remember: Asthma is not a reason to avoid exercise. With proper diagnosis and the most effective treatment, you should be able to enjoy the benefits of an exercise program without having asthma symptoms. If you have any questions, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will probably talk to you about exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction (she might use the old name, exercise-induced asthma). It can happen whether you have asthma or not. It's when your airways constrict and you have asthma symptoms during exercise, such as: Coughing Wheezing Chest tightness Shortness of breath If this happens to you, stop and follow the instructions in your asthma action plan. Keep your rescue inhaler handy, and use it as directed as soon as you have symptoms. If your symptoms are not getting better, call for emergency medical help."
161,"The number of kids who get infected with HIV each year is going down. At the end of 2015, 2.6 million children throughout the world ages 15 and younger were living with the virus, but only about one-third of them were getting treatment. Most cases of childhood HIV and AIDS are in sub- Saharan Africa, the southern part. It's the leading cause of death among preteens and teens there. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, damages your immune system, so you can't fight infections and some cancers well. But with the right combination of drugs and loving support, kids with HIV can grow up to live long, fulfilling lives. Most children who have HIV got it from their mother when she was pregnant, during the birth process, or from breastfeeding. Women who are tested, and then stick with treatment if they're positive, greatly lower the chance of passing the virus to their babies. This is the best way to prevent HIV in children. Kids in communities affected by AIDS who have lost parents and family members are also more vulnerable to HIV infection. They may lack caregivers, access to school, or the ability to stand up for their rights. Children can be infected through sexual abuse or rape. In some countries, child marriages are culturally accepted, and a young girl could get HIV from her older husband, and then pass it to her babies, too. The younger a child is when they first have sex, the higher their chances of getting HIV are. In central and Eastern Europe, injected drug use spreads HIV among young people living on the streets. In one study in Ukraine, high-risk behaviors, including sharing needles, were common among kids as young as 10. Transfusions of HIV-positive blood or injections with unsterilized needles could infect children in poorer countries. The U. S. and Western European countries have medical safeguards to prevent this problem. Not all children with HIV will have symptoms, and those that do won't have exactly the same ones. Symptoms can vary by age. Some of the more common are: Failure to thrive, which means not gaining weight or growing like doctors expect Not having the skills or doing the things doctors expect a child that age would (not reaching developmental milestones) Brain or nervous system problems such as seizures, trouble walking, or doing poorly in school Being sick often with childhood illnesses such as an ear infection, a cold, an upset stomach, or diarrhea As with adults, when an HIV infection advances, kids start to develop infections that rarely affect healthy people but can be deadly for someone whose immune system isn't working well. These ""opportunistic infections"" include: Pneumocystis pneumonia, a fungal infection of the lungs Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) A kind of lung scarring called lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis ( LIP) Oral thrush or severe diaper rash from a yeast infection Children get pretty much the same treatment as adults: a combination of medications called ART (antiretroviral therapy). But it isn't that simple, because some HIV drugs don't come in a liquid form that babies and small children can swallow. And some drugs cause serious side effects for kids. Without ART, one-third of HIV-positive infants worldwide won't make it to their first birthday, and half will die before they're 2. Older kids who don't have symptoms can take ART to help keep them healthy. With ART, complications from HIV or opportunistic infections -- like loss of appetite, diarrhea, and coughs and colds -- can be treated like typical childhood illnesses. Adults should talk to children about the disease in a way that fits their age to help make it less scary. Kids need to know that it's not their fault they're sick and have to take medicine every day, and that they won't be left alone. Social, financial, and emotional support for the whole family is important, especially in communities without a lot of resources. Kids with HIV and AIDS can safely go to school. But they may face bullying and discrimination unless the other students and teachers understand how HIV spreads. Awareness and education programs help break down the stigma around HIV so that children can have friends and feel normal growing up."
162,"HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). HIV weakens a person's immune system, reducing his or her ability to fight infections and cancers. A person can get HIV by coming into contact with an infected person's body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk), and HIV can be spread through: Vaginal, oral, or anal sex Sharing unclean needles to take drugs Pregnancy (from an infected mother to baby) Blood transfusions (since 1985, blood donations have been routinely tested for HIV, so infection from blood transfusions is rare) You cannot get HIV from: Touching or hugging someone who has HIV or AIDS Public bathrooms or swimming pools Sharing cups, utensils, telephones, or other personal items Bug bites There are several types of tests that screen blood (and sometimes saliva) to see if you are infected with HIV. Newer tests can detect the presence of HIV antigen, a protein, up to 20 days earlier than standard tests. This helps prevent spread of the virus to others and start treatment earlier. It is done with a pinprick to the finger. Here's a look at available HIV tests: Standard tests. These blood tests check for HIV antibodies. Your body makes antibodies in response to the HIV infection. These tests can't detect HIV in the blood soon after infection because it takes time for your body to make these antibodies. It generally takes two to 8 weeks for your body to produce antibodies, but in some cases it can take up to six months. In standard tests, a small sample of your blood is drawn and sent to a lab for testing. Some of the standard tests use urine or fluids that are collected from the mouth to screen for antibodies. Rapid antibody tests. Most of these are blood tests for HIV antibodies. Some can detect antibodies in saliva. Results are available in under 30 minutes and are as accurate as standard tests. However, it can take up to 8 weeks (or even longer) for your body to produce antibodies. Antibody/antigen tests. These tests can detect HIV up to 20 days earlier than standard tests. They check for HIV antigen, a part of the virus that shows up 2-4 weeks after infection. These tests can also detect HIV antibodies. A positive result for the antigen allows treatment to begin earlier and the patient to avoid infecting others. These are blood tests only. Rapid antibody/antigen test. One antibody/antigen test delivers results in 20 minutes. In-home test kits. These kits -- there are two available in the U. S. -- screen blood and saliva for HIV antibodies. You can buy them at your local store. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System requires a small blood sample that is collected at home and sent to a lab. The user, who may remain anonymous, can get results by phone in three business days. The Ora Quick In- Home HIV Test can detect HIV antibodies in saliva, if the antibodies are present (which can take up to 6 months). The user swabs the upper and lower gums of their mouths, places the sample in a developer vial, and can get results in 20-40 minutes. A follow-up test should be done if the result is positive. Doctors recommend all pregnant women get tested for HIV. Medications are available to prevent the spread of the virus to your unborn baby. In addition, steps can be taken during delivery to prevent spreading the infection. Some studies show a woman can further reduce the risk of spreading the virus to her baby by having a cesarean section before her water breaks, if her viral load is high or unknown. Moreover, your health care provider can take steps to help you stay healthy longer. No. HIV testing is voluntary. Anyone is free to decline testing. Your decision to not get tested, or the test result itself, will not prevent you from getting health care during pregnancy. Yes. If after giving the blood sample you decide against testing, inform the attending nurse or doctor. Patients who are not hospitalized (outpatients) can withdraw their consent up until they leave the facility. Hospital patients (inpatients) can withdraw their consent up until one hour after the blood sample has been drawn. A confirmed, positive test result means you have been infected with HIV. Being infected with HIV does not necessarily mean that you have AIDS. It can take many years for people with HIV to develop AIDS. A negative test result means that no signs of HIV infection were found in your blood. A negative test does not always mean that you do not have HIV. Signs of HIV may not show up in the blood for several months after infection. For this reason, you should be tested again if you could have been exposed to HIV or are at risk for HIV infection. Your HIV test results become part of your medical record. Therefore, the results could be disclosed to third-party payers (such as medical insurance companies) and other authorized parties. A positive test result will also be reported to the appropriate health department. Though HIV tests performed at most doctors offices become part of the patient's medical record, there are places you can go that provide confidential HIV testing. These places will perform HIV tests without even taking your name (anonymous testing). An anonymous HIV test does not become part of your medical record. Should you discover that you have HIV, inform your medical providers so that you can receive proper care."
163," If you're looking for a safe way to prevent colds, regular exercise may be the ticket. And you don't have to run a marathon, either. Moderate activity is all you need. Exercise improves your overall fitness, which can help boost your immune system -- the body's defense against infections. Some studies show that ""moderate intensity"" exercise may cut down the number of colds you get. That type of activity includes things like a 20- to 30-minute walk every day, going to the gym every other day, or biking with your kids a few times a week. In one study in the American Journal of Medicine, women who walked for a half-hour every day for 1 year had half the number of colds as those who didn't exercise. Researchers found that regular walking may lead to a higher number of white blood cells, which fight infections. In another study, researchers found that in 65-year-olds who did regular exercise, the number of T-cells -- a specific type of white blood cell -- was as high as those of people in their 30s. It's usually safe to do it as long as you listen to your body. You'll need to watch out for certain risky situations. Physical activity increases your heart rate, but so can some cold medicines. So a combo of exercise and decongestants can cause your heart to pump very hard. You may become short of breath and have trouble breathing. If you have asthma and a cold, make sure you talk with your doctor before you exercise. It may cause you to cough and wheeze more and make you short of breath. When your cold comes with a fever, exercise could stress your body even more. So wait a few days to get back to your regular exercise program. Also be careful about working out too hard when you have a cold. It can make you feel worse and slow down your recovery. It's not a problem for most of us, but if you're an exercise fiend, make sure you take time for rest and recovery after periods of intense training. Your immune system works best when it isn't stressed. Scientists say athletes who train intensely without building in recovery time are more likely to get colds or flu. When workouts get too strenuous, the number of infection-fighting white blood cells in your body can go down. At the same time, your stress hormone cortisol may go up, which may interfere with the ability of certain immune cells to work right. If you exercise with a cold, call your doctor if you notice: Your chest is more congested. You cough and wheeze. Stop your activity and get emergency medical help if you: Feel chest tightness or pressure Have trouble breathing or get very short of breath Get lightheaded or dizzy Have problems with balance"
164,"If you have asthma, you need to do what you can to cut your exposure to asthma triggers. Asthma triggers can aggravate your symptoms -- coughing, wheezing, and having a hard time catching your breath. While there's no cure, there are steps you can take to keep your asthma in control and prevent an attack. Certain asthma triggers can set off a cascade of asthma symptoms. These include: Air pollution Allergies Cold air A cold or flu virus Sinusitis Smoke Fragrances It's vital to learn to identify your asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them. Keep track of your symptoms in an asthma diary for several weeks. Detail all the environmental and emotional things that affect your asthma. When you have an asthma attack, check the diary to see which thing, or combination of things, might have led to it. Some common asthma triggers, like molds and cockroaches, aren't always obvious. Ask your asthma specialist about tests to find the allergens you respond to. Then take steps to avoid them. If you have exercise-induced asthma, are planning a heavy workout, or plan to exercise in cold, humid, or dry air, take steps to prevent an asthma attack. Follow your doctor's advice on asthma treatment (usually by using an asthma inhaler containing the drug albuterol). If you have allergies and asthma, it's important to keep your distance from allergens (things you're allergic to). Allergen exposure can increase the inflammation in your airways for a while, making an attack more likely. Smoke and asthma are a bad mix. Limit exposure to all sources of smoke, including tobacco, incense, candles, fires, and fireworks. Don't allow smoking in your home or car, and avoid public places that permit it. If you smoke cigarettes, get help to quit. Smoking always makes asthma worse. Do what you can to stay well. Avoid close contact with people who have a cold or the flu, because catching it will make your asthma symptoms worse. Wash your hands well if you handle items that someone with a respiratory infection may have touched. Whether you're at home, work, or traveling, there are things you can do to allergy-proof your environment and lower your chances of an asthma attack. Don't eat in restaurants that are smoky or allow cigarette smoking. Reserve a smoke-free hotel room. If you can, bring your own bedding and pillows in case the hotel only supplies feather pillows and down comforters. They can house dust mites and cause asthma symptoms. Get a flu shot every year to protect against the flu virus, which can worsen your asthma for days or weeks. Asthma makes you more likely to have complications from the flu, like pneumonia, and to be hospitalized because of it. Anyone over 19 should get a pneumonia shot (called Pneumovax) once every 5 to 10 years. You also have a higher chance of getting pneumococcal pneumonia, a common type of bacterial pneumonia. And you need a Tdap vaccine to protect you against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, along with a zoster vaccine to keep you safe from shingles. If your doctor finds that you have allergies, allergy shots (immunotherapy) may help prevent allergy symptoms and keep your asthma from getting worse. With allergy shots, the doctor injects small doses of allergens under your skin on a regular schedule. Over time, your body may get used to the allergen and respond less when you're exposed. This can help keep your asthma under control. Long-term asthma medications are designed to prevent symptoms and attacks. You need to take them every day, even if you don't have symptoms. They'll ease inflammation in your airways and keep your asthma under control, so it's less likely to flare up. If side effects bother you, talk to your doctor about switching to another treatment. Take your meds, even when you feel OK. If you notice symptoms, check your plan for instructions on what medications to take. During an attack, the plan can tell you what meds will help and when it's time to call the doctor. The meter shows how well air is moving through your lungs. During an attack, your airways narrow. The meter can let you know this is happening hours or days before you have any symptoms. This gives you time to take the medications listed in your treatment plan and possibly stop the attack before it starts."
165,"You probably use screens for just about everything -- to work, to relax, or just to keep up with daily life. If your eyes feel dry and tired, your vision is blurry by the end of the day, or your head, neck, and shoulders ache, all that time with your digital devices might be to blame. If you change how you use smartphones, computers, tablets, and other screens, you can keep from straining your eyes. Normally, we blink about 15-20 times a minute. That spreads tears evenly over your eyes, which keeps them from getting dry and irritated. But researchers have found that people blink less than half as often when they're reading, watching, or playing on a screen. Also, the contrast of text against the background, the glare, and flickering from digital screens can be hard on your eyes. No, you don't have to cut out all screen time. But a few changes to how your use your devices can be easier on your eyes. Make sure your computer screen is about 25 inches, or an arm's length, away from your face. The center of the screen should be about 10-15 degrees below eye level. Cut glare by using a matte screen filter. You can find them for all types of computers, phones, and tablets. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Take a longer break of about 15 minutes after every 2 hours you spend on your devices. Use artificial tears to refresh your eyes when they feel dry. Try putting a humidifier in the room where you most often use a computer or other device. Make sure the lighting in the room you're in is bright enough. You don't want your device to be brighter than the surroundings. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing your glasses. Get regular eye exams. You might need to use a different pair of glasses when you're working on a computer. You can also make sure your devices are set for eye health. Raise the contrast on your screen. Make text larger. Change the brightness of the screen. It shouldn't be lighter or darker than your surroundings. Lower the color temperature of your screen. That means it will give off less blue light, which is linked to more eyestrain. Raise the device's refresh rate. That will cause less flickering of the screen."
166,"When you have diabetes, you have a lot to manage. High blood sugar can lead to other conditions, like eye problems. The most common one is diabetic macular edema. It's serious and can rob you of your vision. That's a scary possibility, but knowing what to look out for and getting the right treatment can help protect your sight. Even if you don't notice problems, when you have diabetes, it's important you get your eyes checked every year. If you do have a problem, see an ophthalmologist right away. This type of doctor treats eye diseases. If you catch it early, there's a chance you can stop long-term damage. High blood sugar weakens the blood vessels in your eyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of your eye. This is called diabetic retinopathy. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharp vision. Diabetic macular edema doesn't always cause symptoms. But you may: Have images directly in front of you appear blurry or wavy See colors that seem âwashed outâ If this happens to you, see your doctor right away. Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions: Have you noticed changes in your vision? If so, what kind? Have you been diagnosed with diabetes? If so, when? Does anyone in your family have it? How have your blood sugar and A1c levels been lately? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Do you have any other medical conditions? You will need a thorough eye exam, which usually includes: A visual acuity test. It checks how well you see at different distances. A dilated eye exam. Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram ( FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. The dye is injected into your arm, but travels quickly to your eye. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina. It is very sensitive and can find even small amounts of fluid and swelling. What is causing my symptoms? Will I lose my sight? Am I at risk for other eye diseases? Do you have experience treating diabetic macular edema? What type of treatment do you recommend for me? What can I expect from it? What else can I do to protect my vision? How often will I need to have my eyes checked? To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes steroid injections may help. Another treatment is a surgery called vitrectomy. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema), and doctors take out the fluid that is clouding your vision and replace it with a clear solution. There's a lot you can do to prevent your condition from getting worse. First, manage your diabetes by controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Diet changes, keeping a healthy weight, and exercise can all help you manage these problems. Talk with your doctor about the best way to do this. Also, don't sidestep regular eye exams. Symptoms can sneak up. Your doctor needs to see you to keep track of track of how your treatment is working. Have you already lost some vision? Talk to your doctor about visual aids, like magnifying glasses, if eyeglasses alone aren't enough. Ask him about resources in your area that can help you learn skills for living with vision loss. Treatment can help you protect your vision. It can greatly decrease your chance of losing your vision. Stay on top of your diabetes, and stick with your treatment plan. You'll have the best chance of maintaining your sight and staying independent.

167,"There are many medications you and your doctor could consider using to treat your RA pain. The main type are NSAIDs, which stands for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They manage pain, swelling, and stiffness. NSAIDs include: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac ( Cataflam, Voltaren) Etodolac ( Lodine) Ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) Indomethacin ( Indocin) Meloxicam ( Mobic) Naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) NSAIDS have been linked to increased risk of heart attack and stroke, particularly in higher doses. Another drawback is that these drugs can upset your stomach or cause ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. Celecoxib is less likely to cause ulcers and stomach or intestinal bleeding. If you have kidney failure or heart failure, your doctor will keep a close watch on how you're doing if you take NSAIDs. This is in many prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including Tylenol. When taken as directed, it has few side effects in most people. One exception is people with liver disease, who can take acetaminophen only if their doctor watches their health closely. These are often called steroids. They're powerful drugs that tame inflammation. They're different from âanabolicâ steroids that build up muscles. For RA, their benefit is that they suppress the overactive immune system, which curbs symptoms. Corticosteroids act throughout the body, not just on the immune system. So they're best used for a short time to control flares. This helps you avoid their side effects. If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis, you may need to take steroids for a long time. Your doctor will watch out for potential side effects, such as being more likely to get an infection, higher blood sugar, or bone thinning. Corticosteroids can sometimes be injected directly into joints affected by RA. This is a good way to get the benefits of the drug with fewer side effects."
168,"It can take a little fine-tuning, along with a dose of patience, to get the most out of your RA treatment. Ask yourself these questions to see if you're doing all you can to get your pain and stiffness under control. 1. Do you take your RA medications on time? It's important to keep a regular schedule for your meds. Take them at the same time each day. They work better if you keep a constant level of medicine in your body. Don't skip a dose because that can trigger a flare. Keep in mind that some medicines, like methotrexate, can take weeks or months to fully kick in. Try to be patient and give your meds a chance to work. If you get an upset stomach or other side effects, call your doctor. They can suggest things you can do to feel better. 2. Have you asked your doctor if you're on the right medicines? If they used to work and don't seem to help anymore, it may be time for a change. Some ""disease-modifying"" drugs may not work as well after a while. Your doctor may recommend a different prescription or add another type of drug, such as a biologic, to your treatment. 3. Do you keep up with regular checkups? Some RA drugs affect your immune system -- your body's defense against germs. This helps slow down the disease, but it can make infections more likely, as well as liver and kidney problems. Make sure you see your doctor for regular blood tests. They help him figure out if you need to tweak your treatment. 4. Have you tried alternative remedies for pain? Studies show that meditation and biofeedback can ease pain for some people and help them handle it better. Massage may help with stress, cut stiffness, and make your joints hurt less. Research shows that acupuncture can be helpful for other conditions, but it's not been well-studied for RA. These may not work for everyone, and it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first, especially if you want to take any herbs or supplements, because some could affect your medications. 5. Is your doctor a good fit for you? You'll want to see a rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in arthritis and other joint and muscle problems. He should respond to your needs and take the time to find the best treatment plan for you. He should be willing to make changes to your treatment if you don't feel better, and to refer you to other health pros, such as physical therapists and occupational therapists, if you need them."
169,"Life with atrial fibrillation has its challenges, for sure. But with the right treatment and some lifestyle changes, you can stay active and energetic. Symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and a fast heartbeat can make it harder to get around and do your daily activities. You might have to adjust your routine because of your symptoms or the medicine you take to treat them. Here are a few simple changes you can make and good habits you can practice to protect your heart and help you feel your best: A diet heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein is always a good idea. Here are a few other diet tips for people who have AFib: Go to a healthier-fat, low-salt diet. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat, and salt to help control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This will also protect your blood vessels. Limit caffeine. Watch how much soda, coffee, tea, energy drinks, and chocolate you have. These can make your heart race. Cut back on alcohol. A drink or two might be safe with your doctor's OK. But large amounts can set off bouts of AFib. If you take blood thinners, alcohol could make you bleed too much. Regular amounts of vitamin K. People who take the blood thinner warfarin ( Coumadin, Jantoven) need to be careful about eating foods that are high in vitamin K such as broccoli, spinach, or lettuce. Your body uses vitamin K to help your blood clot. Coumadin stops blood clots from forming. Eating a lot or very little of this vitamin can affect how well your medicine works. Try to eat about the same amount of vitamin K-rich foods each day. You can still exercise when you have AFib. Staying active will help control your weight, improve your sleep, and make your heart stronger. See your doctor before you start any new fitness program to make sure the activity is safe for you. Ask your doctor how to handle your AFib during exercise. If your heart goes out of rhythm during a workout, stop and rest. You have a higher chance of AFib when you are too heavy. It also makes your AFib more likely to come back after a procedure such as ablation. To manage your condition, try to lose at least 10% of your body weight with diet and exercise if your doctor or dietician has told you that you're obese. The nicotine in cigarettes can make this condition worse. Smoking also damages your blood vessels and raises your chances for heart disease and a heart attack. Ask your doctor to recommend a method, such as medicine or nicotine replacement, to help you quit. Stress can trigger AFib episodes. When you feel anxious, try relaxation techniques such as these: Deep breathing Exercise Massage Meditation Yoga If your stress feels overwhelming, see a therapist or seek out a support group for help. Adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. About half of people with AFib don't sleep well because their breathing stops over and over again during the night -- a condition called sleep apnea. If you snore or feel like you never get a good night's rest, see your doctor for a diagnosis. Your doctor will prescribe medicine or other treatments to control your heart rhythm and prevent blood clots. Take your medicine just as prescribed. Don't change the dose or stop taking it without first asking your doctor. Some medications, such as cough and cold medicines, have stimulants that can make your heart beat faster. Other medicines and supplements you take can interact poorly with your AFib drugs. Tell your doctor and pharmacist before you take any new medicine -- even ones you buy at the drugstore without a prescription."
170,"Since you've recently been diagnosed with osteoporosis, ask your doctor these questions at your next visit. Are there ways to keep osteoporosis from worsening? Can medications taken for other illnesses cause bone loss? How can I prevent fractures? How frequently should I have a bone density test? How much calcium and vitamin D do I need every day, and how can I get enough of these nutrients? How much exercise do I need to boost bone strength, and which exercises do you recommend? Is hormone replacement therapy safe for preventing osteoporosis? What osteoporosis medications are available that prevent bone loss? What are some other lifestyle changes I should make now to keep my bones strong? What does my T-score mean? ( A T-score is the result of a bone density test.)"
171,"What Is Photorefractive Keratectomy? Also known as PRK, this type of laser eye surgery can help if you are nearsighted, farsighted, or have astigmatism. It works best if your eye problem is mild or moderate. All laser vision correction surgeries work by reshaping your cornea, the clear front part of your eye. Think of it like a windshield -- light travels through it just and focuses on the retina in the back of your eye. During PRK, an eye surgeon uses a cool pulsing beam of ultraviolet light on the surface of your cornea. LASIK, another type of laser surgery, works underneath your cornea. It's highly accurate in correcting many cases of nearsightedness. Most people have 20/20 or at least 20/40 vision without glasses or contact lenses one year after the surgery. It isn't a walk in the park. You might have: Mild discomfort, including minor eye irritation and watering, for 1 to 3 days after the procedure. A longer recovery time. People who get LASIK notice improvements in less than a month. With PRK it can take 1 to3 months. A need for glasses. You'll have mild discomfort in the first 24 to 72 hours after surgery. You might be sensitive to light for a while, too. Within the first 6 months you might also notice that you need eyeglasses for improved vision. First you'll meet with an eye surgeon or a coordinator who to talk about what you should expect during and after surgery. She'll discuss your medical history and check your eyes. Likely tests include: Corneal thickness measure Refraction Corneal mapping Eye pressure check After that, your surgeon will answer any questions you have. Then you'll schedule your surgery. If you wear contacts, you'll need to stop for a while before the evaluation: Gas permeable: 3 weeks Other types: 3 days On the day of surgery, eat a light meal before going in, and take all of your prescribed medications. Don't wear eye makeup or bulky hair accessories that will make it hard to place your head under the laser. If you don't feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to find out if the procedure needs to be postponed. The doctor will numb your eye with a medicine he'll call a topical anesthetic. The surgery usually takes about 10 minutes, at most -- and that's for both eyes. She'll carefully remove an area of surface epithelium, or âskin,â to get to the top layer of your eye. Then she'll use a laser to reshape it. This laser, which delivers ultraviolet light, is used on the cornea's surface. Most of the time, the doctor will apply a bandage contact lens after surgery. You'll wear it for the first 5 to 7 days to let the surface of your eye heal. You'll see the eye doctor at least a few times during the next 6 months. The first visit is usually 1 day after surgery; the second vision, in which the doctor will remove the contact lens, happens about a week later. Your vision may switch from clear to blurry for the first few weeks. Until it evens out, you might need glasses to read or drive at night. Your eyes will be dry, even if they don't feel that way. The doctor will prescribe eyedrops to prevent infection and keep your eyes moist. They might sting or blur your vision for a few seconds. Don't use any drops your doctor hasn't approved. Your vision will get better slowly. You should be ready to drive within 1 to 3 weeks. But you probably won't see your best for 6 weeks to 6 months. Probably so. That's because presbyopia (blurred reading vision but great distance vision) happens to almost everyone in their 40s. Reading glasses solve the problem. So does a process called monovision, where one eye focuses up close and the other focuses far away. You can get it with contacts or through laser refractive surgery, like LASIK or PRK. Ask your doctor if it's right for you."
172,"If you feel a lump, pain or swelling in your testicles, you may wonder what's going on. This could be caused by any number of things, and cancer is just one of them. Testicular cancer is rare in general, but it is the most common one in males 15 to 34. It's also one of the easiest to cure. About 95% of those survive more than 5 years after it's found. Get an appointment with your doctor if you feel anything new, abnormal or painful in that area. He can do an exam and give you various kinds of tests find out what it is. The testicles (sometimes called testes) are oval-shaped organs a little smaller than a golf ball and hang from the base of a man's torso. They rest in a sac of skin known as the scrotum, beneath the penis. They make the sperm that fertilizes a woman's egg to create a baby as well as make hormones such as testosterone. You have testicular cancer when abnormal cells start to grow out of control on the testes. The majority of cases come in two main types: Seminomas, which are slow-growing and slow-spreading tumors. Nonseminomas, which are usually made up of more than one type of cancer cell. They grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. There are also growths called âstromal tumorsâ that are often benign but sometimes can be cancerous. They show up in the tissues that produce hormones inside the testicles. They account for about 5% of adult cases and about 20% for boys. There are a variety of things that might make you more likely to get testicular cancer. They include: Testes that didn't form or descend normally. Your father or brother has had it. You've had testicular cancer before. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Men in their 20s and early 30s make up about half of all cases. Also, white men are as much as five times more likely than African- American or Asian- American men to develop testicular cancer. Being in the higher-risk groups does not mean you will get cancer. And you may not have any of these risk factors and could still develop it. Often, you can find a tumor by examining yourself. Here's how to do it: While standing, gently but firmly roll each testicle between your thumb and fingers and feel for anything abnormal. If you come across a small, hard lump, any pain, or swelling, check with your doctor. As you feel the testicle, you may notice a cordlike structure on top and in back of the testicle. This is called âthe epididymis.â It is about an inch long and is sensitive but should not be painful to touch. Do not mistake this for a lump. Do the exam during or after a warm bath or shower. This relaxes the skin, making it easier to feel anything unusual. Sometimes, a testicle may not have a lump but could be swollen or enlarged. However, it's normal for one of your testicles to be larger than the other. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about your exam. Sometimes, testicular cancer can cause a heavy feeling or ache in your scrotum or lower belly. You might also have sudden buildup of fluid in your scrotum. In boys, it might cause more male sex hormones than normal to be made. Watch for early signs of puberty, such as the growth of facial hair or a deepening of the voice, in a younger boy. There's no standard test for detecting it, but sometimes your doctor will notice something not quite right during a routine exam. If he finds a sign, he has several tests he can use can confirm a diagnosis or rule it out. They include: An ultrasound: It uses sound waves to paint a picture of the testicles inside the scrotum. It's like the tests given to pregnant women to view a developing fetus. It can tell whether some growths are more likely to be cancer or might be something harmless. When you do this test, you usually lie on your back on an exam table. A technician spreads a clear gel over your scrotum that may feel a bit cool, then moves an ultrasound device over your scrotum. Blood test: In many cases, testicular cancers create proteins or enzymes that can be found in the blood. If they are elevated, it may help doctors determine which type of cancer you have or whether it has spread. To get the blood, a doctor's aide will insert a thin needle into your arm to pull it out. You usually just feel a small prick. Biopsy: In a few cases, doctors will perform surgery to remove a small piece of the tumor and check it for cancer. That's called a biopsy, and you usually get the result quickly. It's rarely done because there's a chance the procedure could cause the cancer to spread. If your doctor finds a tumor, he'll do more tests to make sure cancer hasn't spread. Those tests might include X-rays or other types of scans. Once your tests are done, doctors will try to find out whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body and if so, how far. The basic diagnosis usually includes a number, called a stage. In Stage 0, the cancer is found only in small tubes inside of the testicle called seminiferous tubules. In Stage I, cancer is limited to the testicle and tissues close to it. In Stage II, it has spread to the lymph nodes in the abdomen. In Stage III, cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes or other organs, perhaps as far as the lungs, liver or brain. This is known as âmetastasis.â Once your diagnosis is finished, you and your doctor can talk about the best treatment."
173,"When you lose someone or something dear to you, it's natural to feel pain and grief. The grief process is normal, and most people go through it. But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression. Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce, moving, or retiring While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process. There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with ""not caring."" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledges its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades. Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what ""could have been done"" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person's life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn't dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression: In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we're angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general. Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different. Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs, alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming. If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, and even thoughts of suicide, you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved."
174,"For 9 months, the food you ate fueled you and your baby. But after you give birth, your diet is just as important. It helps your body recover and gives you the energy you need to care for your little one. Know your nutrition needs so you can stay healthy while you bring up baby. In the months after childbirth, most new moms need between 1,800 and 2,200 calories each day. Nursing? You'll need up to 500 more. If you're underweight, you work out more than 45 minutes each day, or you're breastfeeding more than one infant, that number could be higher. Talk to your doctor to figure out the right amount for you and to determine continuation of vitamin supplementation. Even though you're not âeating for two,â your body needs to restore a lot of important nutrients. At every meal, fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. The other half should include whole grains like brown rice, whole-grain bread, or oatmeal. Try to limit packaged, processed foods and drinks that are high in salt, saturated fat, and extra sugars. You also need to get enough: Protein: Foods like beans, seafood, lean meats, eggs, and soy products are rich in protein, which help your body recover from childbirth. Aim for five servings each day, or seven if you're breastfeeding. Calcium: You'll need 1,000 milligrams -- about 3 servings of low-fat dairy -- each day. Iron: This nutrient helps your body make new blood cells, which is especially important if you lost a lot of blood during your delivery. Red meat and poultry are high in iron. So are tofu and beans. Whether you eat meat or go vegetarian, the daily requirement for lactating women is 9 mg daily for women ages 19 and older, and 10 mg daily for adolescents. If you had twins, have a health condition, or are vegan, check with your doctor. You may need a supplement to get the right nutrition. Most new moms lose about 4.5 pounds of baby weight each month. You may be tempted to go on a diet to speed up the process, but that's not a good idea. If you get fewer than 1,800 calories, you'll see a drastic drop in your energy level and mood. If you're nursing, you can also harm your baby if you don't eat enough. The best thing to do is to stick with a healthy, balanced meal plan, and start exercising when your doctor says it's OK. If you're breastfeeding, the foods you eat can pass to your baby through your milk. Be careful with: Alcohol: Experts have different opinions on how much (if any) is safe for a baby. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Caffeine: Drink more than 3 cups (24 ounces) of coffee or soda a day, and you can upset your baby's sleep. Some fish: Swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish are high in mercury, a toxin that is harmful to your baby, so avoid them. Tuna can have some mercury, too. Make sure to only eat the âlightâ kind and no more than 6 ounces each week. Keep healthy snacks on hand. If you have fresh veggies and fruit washed and ready to go in the fridge, you'll likely reach for them rather than chips or cookies. Stay hydrated. Aim for 6-10 glasses of water each day, whether you're nursing or not. You can also drink milk and fruit juice. Ask friends to cook for you. When loved ones ask how they can help, suggest they bring you a healthy dish. In these first weeks after you give birth, you may be too tired to cook."
175,"Cervicitis is inflammation of the cervix -- the lower end of the uterus that opens into the vagina.  Cervicitis is common. It may be caused by a number of factors, including infections, chemical or physical irritations, and allergies. Determining the cause of cervicitis is important. If an infection is the problem, it can spread beyond the cervix to the uterus and fallopian tubes and into the pelvic and abdominal cavity and cause life-threatening infection. This may cause problems with fertility --the ability to become pregnant. Or it may cause problems with your unborn baby if you are already pregnant. Here's what you need to know about symptoms, causes, risk factors, tests, diagnosis, and treatment of cervicitis. Cervicitis is inflammation of the cervix, which can bedue to: Irritation Infection Injury of cells that line the cervix These irritated or infected tissues may become red, swollen, and ooze mucus and pus. They may also bleed easily when touched. Severe cases of inflammation are usually caused by infections that are passed during sexual activity. Sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs) that may cause cervicitis include: Gonorrhea Chlamydia Genital herpes Trichomoniasis Mycoplasma and ureaplasma But many women with cervicitis don't test positive for any type of infection. Other causes of the inflammation may include: Allergies to chemicals in spermicides, douches, or to the latex rubber in condoms Irritation or injury from tampons, pessaries, or from birth control devices like diaphragms Bacterial imbalance; normal, healthy bacteria in the vagina are overwhelmed by unhealthy or harmful bacteria. This is also called bacterial vaginosis. Hormonal imbalance; having relatively low estrogen or high progesterone may interfere with the body's ability to maintain healthy cervical tissue. Cancer or cancer treatment; rarely, radiation therapy or cancer may cause changes to the cervix consistent with cervicitis. Many women with cervicitis don't have any symptoms. The condition may be discovered only after a routine exam or test. Signs and symptoms, if present, may include: Grayish or pale yellow vaginal discharge Abnormal vaginal bleeding, such as bleeding after sex or between periods Pain during sex Difficult, painful, or frequent urination Pelvic or abdominal pain or fever, in rare cases You may be at higher risk for cervicitis if you: Had recent sexual intercourse without a condom Recently had multiple sexual partners Have had cervicitis before Studies show that cervicitis will recur in 8% to 25% of women who get it. If your doctor suspects you have cervicitis, he or she may do a pelvic exam. This lets the doctor get a closer look at the cervix. The doctor will probably also swab the cervix to collect vaginal fluids or to see how easily it bleeds. Your doctor will also probably ask questions about your sexual history. The doctor will want to know: The number of partners you've had in the past Whether or not you've had sex without a condom The kind of contraception you used Even if you don't have symptoms, your doctor will perform a routine exam to look for cervicitis if: You are pregnant The doctor thinks you are at high risk for an STD Your doctor may swab the cervix to check for discharge, swelling, tenderness, and bleeding. Your doctor will test your vaginal fluid for the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses. You may not need treatment for cervicitis if a sexually transmitted infection is not the cause. If an infection is suspected, the main goal of treatment is to eliminate the infection and prevent it from spreading to the uterus and fallopian tubes, or if you are pregnant, to your baby. Depending on what organism is causing the infection, your doctor may prescribe: Antibiotics Antifungal medications Antiviral medications Your doctor may also recommend that your partner be treated to make sure you don't get infected again. You should not have sex until you and your partner have finished treatment. Treatment is especially important if you are HIV positive. That's because cervicitis increases the amount of virus that is shed from the cervix. This may increase your chances of infecting a partner. Also, having cervicitis can make it easier for you to get HIV from an HIV-positive partner. If your symptoms persist despite treatment, you should be reevaluated by your doctor. Nondrug treatments like douches or yogurt-based therapy do not work for cervicitis and may actually worsen symptoms. They are not recommended. You can decrease your risk of getting cervicitis by taking the following steps: Have your partner always use condoms during sex. Limit the number of people you have sex with. Don't have sex with a partner who has genital sores or penile discharge. If you get treatment for a sexually transmitted disease, ask your doctor if your partner should also be treated. Don't use feminine hygiene products. These may cause irritation of your vagina and cervix. If you have diabetes, try to maintain good control of your blood sugar."
176,"Loses bladder or bowel control Has weakness in the arms or legs Has numbness in the inner, upper part of the thighs Changing positions or shifting posture may reduce immediate discomfort. For example, laying on the back, with feet on a chair and knees at a 90-degree angle, can sometimes be quite comfortable for back problems. Apply a cold compress several times a day for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Give nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (such as Motrin, Aleve, Advil or Naprosyn). Bed rest for a day or two may help, but no longer than that; it is important to become active again sooner rather than later. The person should avoid activities such as lifting or pushing. All slipped disks should be evaluated. The health care provider may recommend muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory medications, injections of pain reliever, acupuncture, or physical therapy. Most people feel better within six weeks. In some cases, back surgery is necessary."
177,"The symptoms are all there. Your child can't sit still for any length of time. She doesn't follow instructions well. She's unorganized and forgetful at school. It's possible she has ADHD. Maybe you make careless mistakes at work and keep losing your keys. Is it ADHD if you have a hard time keeping up with presentations in meetings? Before you jump to any conclusions, consider what else could be causing these kinds of behaviors. It may not be an illness after all, and it may be something you can easily fix. Your brain needs water to work. When you're low on fluids, your brain's chemistry gets thrown off, and your memory and your ability to think clearly and make decisions suffer. Drink a glass of water when you feel like your thoughts aren't clicking. To help keep your body hydrated, have one with every meal and at least one between meals. Drink up before, after, and while you exercise, too. How long has it been since you've eaten? If you're moody, cranky, drowsy, or confused, it may be because you have low blood sugar. A healthy meal or snack -- like a spinach salad with salmon and avocado, or a handful of walnuts -- could help you concentrate. Eating a lot of sweets, though, could slow down your brain. A little caffeine can help you focus, but too much can make you jittery and restless. You may not realize how much you're getting. It's found in chocolate and some headache medicines, as well as coffee, black and green teas, sodas, and energy drinks. And having caffeine later in the day might cause trouble sleeping, which can also make you distracted. If you've been overdoing the caffeine, back off slowly to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Let's face it: There usually aren't enough hours in the day. And buying yourself some time by staying up late or getting up early may sound like a solution. But when you don't get enough sleep, your judgment, mood, and ability to learn and remember suffer. You're more likely to make mistakes. Allow your brain to rest and repair itself. A regular schedule, a soothing bedtime ritual, and comfortable bedroom conditions can help you fall asleep faster. To improve the quality of your sleep, get some exercise during the day and limit how much you eat and drink right before bed. Try cutting back on or avoiding naps to encourage nighttime slumber. Stress is your body's reaction when it feels threatened in some way. Your child could have trouble with a subject at school, get into a fight with a friend, or pick up on tension at home. Perhaps you're trying to make a deadline or are worried about an unexpected expense. It's normal to be thinking about what's bothering you rather than what you should be paying attention to, but being distracted can lead to trouble. Long-term stress can also hurt memory. To clear your head, start by recognizing that you're upset or anxious. Admitting it will actually help your body relax. Breathe, and give yourself some encouragement that things will work out. Take a walk, go for a run, or do some yoga to ease the tension and make you feel more alert. This can be really stressful for kids, especially when it happens through email, texting, a chat room, or on a web site. It's hard to avoid cyberbullying, and it's easy for others to pile on and amplify it. The effects of bullying can show up in a kid's grades, attitude, and health. Talk to your child about what's going on. If it is bullying, most schools have prevention programs and anti-bullying policies. Find out what these policies are and check that they're being enforced. Give your child positive support to build their self-esteem and confidence and to take away the bully's power. Help them figure out how to respond when it happens and what you and they can do to stop it. Some children, especially those who are gifted, can become easily bored and impulsive, especially at school. They'll stare out the window or doze off in class. A gifted child can also become bossy and may not make friends easily because they're seen as a ""know-it-all."" They dislike routine, resist direction, and can be disruptive. They'll look for something to keep their minds occupied. Meet with your child's teacher to talk about the classroom setting and schoolwork. They may have more insight into what's behind the behavior, and they might be able to make adjustments to keep your child interested. Problems at school or work, poor memory, bad judgment, and moodiness are just a few symptoms of drug or alcohol misuse. The key things to look for are big changes in how someone looks, acts, and interacts with others. If you think this might be the issue, reach out to someone -- a counselor, social worker, doctor, or clergy member -- who can help you help yourself, your child, or loved one. Drug addiction can be treated with behavior therapy, sometimes medication, and support. An ongoing pattern of behavior that suggests inattention, hyperactivity, or being impulsive could be ADHD if it: Started before age 12 Has lasted for more than 6 months Interferes with daily life Happens in multiple settings Your pediatrician or primary care doctor can diagnose the disorder. They'll want to hear from parents, teachers, and others who have regular contact with the person. Your doctor may do tests or have you see a specialist to rule out other causes, too."
178,"Do you plan to start using a blood pressure monitor? You're part of a growing group. Doctors are telling more and more people with high blood pressure to check their numbers at home. Why? At the doctor's office, your blood pressure reading only shows your numbers at that moment. A home monitor lets you check it often. This can give your doctor a better idea of your true blood pressure. The best way to know for sure if you have high blood pressure is to measure it several times a day for a few months. There are lots of home blood pressure monitors to choose from. Many cost less than $100. You don't need a prescription to get one. You can find them at your local pharmacy, a discount store, a medical supply store, and online. You can even choose a model that you wear on your arm or wrist during the day. But not all of these are accurate. That's why it's important to bring your blood pressure monitor to the doctor before you start to use it. She can test it against the ones used in her office. There are two basic types of monitors that use an arm cuff: Aneroid monitors: You squeeze a bulb to inflate the cuff around your upper arm. Then you read a gauge to find your blood pressure. These are the least expensive options, but they're also easy to damage. Digital monitors: On some models you inflate the cuff. On others the machine does it for you. Your reading appears on a small screen. Some even offer a paper printout. They're easy to use and read. They may be less accurate than the ones that use a cuff. That's because you need to take the reading with your arm at heart level. Other positions can affect your numbers. But they could be a good option if a cuff monitor hurts or if your upper arm is too large for one. Many smartphone apps claim to measure blood pressure, but can you trust the results? Early research suggests you can't -- at least not yet. One small study found readings from a popular blood pressure app were highly inaccurate. A review of several apps notes that most haven't been scientifically proven to give correct readings. It recommends more studies before apps are used for medical purposes. The home blood pressure monitor you choose should be the one that's right for you, not necessarily the one your friend or neighbor likes. Follow this smart shopper checklist: Make sure it fits. An arm cuff that's the wrong size can affect your readings. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can tell you what size you need. It's OK to be frugal. A high-tech wireless monitor can cost $200, but it may not be better or more accurate than a much less expensive model. Many top-rated blood pressure monitors cost between $40 and $75. Check to see if your insurance company will cover it. Think about features. Do you want multiple cuffs? Do you need a device that stores information for more than one user? How about a large display? These features and more are available on different models. Ease of use. You may find some monitors simpler to use and read than others. Try out a few before you choose."
179,"You've probably heard that you need to keep your cholesterol under control. But do you get confused about what's good to eat and what's not? Do you wonder about whether you're active enough and whether you're at the right weight? The TLC Program, short for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, could clear up some of your questions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made it for people who want to control their cholesterol. Even if you take medications for it, you may want to consider the possible benefits of this program. It has three parts: diet, exercise, and weight control. The goal: Reduce your risk of heart disease. This is not a fad diet. It's considered a âbalancedâ plan, and the idea is to change your habits for the long run. It's good to learn a few basics about your body first and then get an overview of the program. Every cell in your body has cholesterol, a fat-like, waxy substance. And it's something you need. It helps you digest food as well as make vitamin D and certain hormones. The issue is how much you have. A substance called lipoprotein carries it throughout your system. It comes in two main varieties: Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL). It's often called the âbad cholesterol.â High-density lipoprotein ( HDL). That's the âgood cholesterol.â When levels of LDL are too high, your chance of heart disease increases. The program tries to lower your LDL levels. But you want to raise those good HDL levels, and the diet aims for that, too. This plan focuses on foods that are low in natural cholesterol and saturated fat but high in the so-called âgood fats.â One class of these good fats is monounsaturated fats. You also get a lot of fiber in this diet. When you follow the program, you shoot for 2 key numbers every day: Less than 7% of your calories from saturated fat. Less than 200 milligrams of dietary cholesterol. You do this to lower your LDL level. You can always talk to your doctor or dietician in more detail about how to measure how much fat and dietary cholesterol you're taking in. You may be surprised how easy it is to find food that tastes great and also satisfies your hunger on the program. When you follow the TLC Program, you lower the amount of fat you eat and choose things that are better for your heart. All the fat you eat in one day should not go over 35% of total calories. Try to avoid saturated fats. Some of the foods they can be found in include: Butter Egg yolks Fatty cuts of meat Lard Whole milk dairy products These can also raise cholesterol. Avoid them when you can. They are found in products such as: Fried foods Shortening Stick margarine Sweets Foods made with hydrogenated oil or partially hydrogenated oil should also be limited. When you're grocery shopping, be sure you're reading labels. Up to 20% of your calories can come from monounsaturated fats. They can help lower your LDL levels. Plus, these fats don't lower your good, or HDL, cholesterol levels. Some sources include: Avocados Olive, canola, and almond oils Peanut butter About 10% of your calories can come from polyunsaturated fats. Use these in moderation. While they lower LDL levels, which you want to happen, they can also lower HDL levels, which is what you don't want. Some choices: Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and trout Pumpkin and sunflower seeds Soybean, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, and corn oils Your body makes cholesterol, but you also get it from food. Animal products such as red meat, shellfish, and egg yolks, for example, all contain cholesterol. With the TLC Program, you must keep your intake of dietary cholesterol to less than 200 milligrams a day. Choose lean meat and reduced-fat dairy products as often as you can. It's important to growth and helps your body repair cells. Protein-rich foods should make up about 20% of your daily total calories. But here's the catch. Many protein sources are also high in cholesterol and saturated fat. You have options beyond lean meats and reduced-fat dairy. They include: Beans Lentils Seeds Soy products Carbohydrates are an important part of good nutrition, but you need to choose the right kind. The program calls for about 50% to 60% of your calories to come from them. Aim for carbs that are complex, meaning they are not heavily processed and are high in fiber. That's important, because the TLC diet calls for about 20 to 30 grams of fiber a day. Some great choices: Beans Fruit Lentils Quinoa Vegetables Whole grains and whole wheat sources That's a whole lot of information about food to take in, but there are two more pillars to the program. Physical activity is also part of the plan. You should try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most, if not all, days of the week. Brisk walking is a great place for many people to start. Some other suggestions: Bicycling Bowling Dancing Gardening Of course, you should talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. The third part of the TLC Program is about shedding unwanted pounds. Besides the cholesterol, extra fat can increase your chances for high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and other issues. If you've improved your diet and exercise, but are still struggling with weight, the program suggests checking with your doctor. It also offers ideas to help with your goal of weight loss: Slow down while you eat; it takes the brain a while to get the message you're full Eat more fruits and vegetables; they make you feel full Serve your food on smaller plates Eat three meals a day; don't skip any The TLC Program is most successful when you work directly with your doctor or dietician, who can also guide you to become more physically active, manage your weight, and reach your cholesterol goals. Your doctor can also help you control other things that make heart disease more likely, including quitting smoking and controlling high blood pressure, for example. For some people, lifestyle changes alone may not be enough. You will need medication, too. But with lifestyle changes such as the TLC Program, you may be able to take lower doses. Talk to your doctor and get your cholesterol levels checked. Based on those results and other factors, she can see whether you have a chance of getting heart disease. With the TLC Program, you start out meeting with your doctor every six weeks to track how well lifestyle changes are working for you."
180,"Maybe you're having one of those "" OK"" days with rheumatoid arthritis, when you feel alright, but not quite at the top of your game. Want to take it to the next level? Check out some exercise and diet choices that can make a big difference in how you feel. They can help you strengthen your muscles and improve your flexibility. Your doctor can give you a referral. Therapists can show you the safest ways to move your body for everyday tasks, like lifting a box, to help protect your joints. They can also teach you exercises to do at home safely. You want to build strength, but you don't want to overdo it and trigger a flare. An occupational therapist shows you ways to do specific tasks at home or at work. A physical therapist helps keep you moving and gets you stronger and more flexible. No matter which type you choose, it's best to see someone who has experience working with people who have arthritis. These slow, gentle, flowing exercises help boost your balance and flexibility. They may even ease your pain. Research by the Arthritis Foundation shows that yoga poses, breathing, and relaxation lower joint tenderness and swelling for some people with RA. Studies show tai chi reduces long-term pain. Pilates strengthens your core, which takes pressure off your joints. All of these exercises are good for your mind and your body. They can bust stress while they build up your strength. It helps you fight inflammation. Certain fish, for example, are full of omega-3 fatty acids that curb chemicals called cytokines, which ramp up inflammation in the body. People with RA have higher levels of cytokines than others. Studies show that omega-3s may ease joint pain and shorten the time you have morning stiffness. Good sources include cold-water fatty fish like salmon, trout, tuna, or sardines. You also need colorful fruits and veggies for an anti-inflammation diet. They have antioxidants that fight damaging free-radical molecules in your body. Also go for whole grains like oatmeal, brown rice, and barley. People who eat whole grains tend to have lower levels of C-reactive protein, a sign of inflammation in the body. It's an important part of staying on top of your RA. Even when your pain and stiffness is less of a problem, keep up with your appointments. See your doctor two to four times a year to make sure your symptoms don't flare up. If you don't already see a rheumatologist, consider asking for a referral. He's a doctor who specializes in arthritis. He can review your treatment plan and see if it needs any tweaks. Studies show that people with RA who see a rheumatologist several times a year do better."
181,"It's the most common type of kidney cancer. Although it's a serious disease, finding and treating it early makes it more likely that you'll be cured. No matter when you're diagnosed, you can do certain things to ease your symptoms and feel better during your treatment. Most people who have renal cell carcinoma are older, usually between ages 50 and 70. It often starts as just one tumor in a kidney, but sometimes it begins as several tumors, or it's found in both kidneys at once. You might also hear it called renal cell cancer. Doctors have different ways to treat renal cell carcinoma, and scientists are testing new ones, too. You'll want to learn as much about your disease as you can and work with your doctor so you can choose the best treatment. Scientists aren't sure exactly what causes renal cell carcinoma. They know that most kidney cancers start when something goes wrong in the genes in the kidney. No one can say for certain why that happens. Several things can raise your chances of getting the disease, like: Smoking Being very overweight Taking a lot of pain medicine, like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, for a long time Having hepatitis C Exposure to certain dyes, asbestos, cadmium (a metal), herbicides, and solvents Having acquired cystic kidney disease Some inherited conditions, especially von Hippel- Lindau disease Early on, renal cell carcinoma doesn't usually cause any symptoms. As the disease gets more serious, you might have warning signs like: A lump on your side, belly, or lower back Blood in your pee Low back pain on one side Losing weight for no clear reason Not feeling hungry Fever Feeling tired Not enough red blood cells (anemia) Night sweats High levels of calcium in your blood High blood pressure Your doctor will want to find out more about your symptoms to figure out what's going on. First, he'll give you a physical exam and ask you questions like: When did you first notice a problem? Is there blood in your urine? Have you been having any pain? Where? Does anything make your symptoms better or worse? Has anyone in your family had von Hippel- Lindau disease? What about kidney cancer? From there, he'll do some tests that could include: Urine tests Blood tests Biopsy Tests to see how well your liver is working Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make a picture of the organs inside your body CT scan, a test that uses a powerful X-ray to make detailed pictures inside your body Nephrectomy, when doctors remove part of one of your kidneys, or sometimes the whole kidney, to check it for renal cell carcinoma. You'll have this test if your doctor has already spotted a tumor, but doesn't know if it's cancer. If the results show that you have renal cell carcinoma, your doctor will find out what stage it's in, so you can decide on the best treatment options. The stage of cancer depends on how large your tumor is and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. You may have tests to take a closer look inside your chest and belly, like: Chest X-ray CT scan MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the inside of your body Bone scan What stage is my cancer? What does that mean for me? Do I need any more tests? Do I need to see any other doctors? Have you ever treated this kind of cancer before? What kinds of treatments are there? Which would you recommend? How will those treatments make me feel? When should I start treatment? How will we know if it works? What will my recovery be like? What would you expect for me? Are there any clinical trials I can sign up for? There are a few different ways doctors can treat renal cell carcinoma. You may need to try several before finding one that works. The best plan for you depends on the stage of your cancer, how healthy you are overall, and any side effects you might have. Your options may include: Surgery to remove part or all of the kidney Biologic drugs, which boost your body's own defenses to fight cancer cells Drugs such as interferon-alfa or interleukin-2 Targeted therapy -- treatments that attack specific things cancers need to survive, like a tumor's blood vessels or certain proteins; these include axitinib ( Inlyta), bevacizumab ( Avastin), cabozantinib ( Cometriq), everolimus ( Afinitor), lenvatinib ( Lenvima), nivolumab ( Opdivo), pazopanib ( Votrient), sorafenib ( Nexavar), sunitinib ( Sutent), and temsirolimus ( Torisel). Ablation. This uses extreme cold or radio waves to destroy tumors. Many kinds of cancer are treated with radiation or chemotherapy, or sometimes both. These treatments usually don't work well for renal cell carcinoma. In some cases, your doctor may still prescribe them to ease your symptoms or if other treatments haven't worked. Talk with her about these options and how they might make you feel. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat renal cell carcinoma in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. It's important to treat your disease, but also to make sure you're comfortable. Tell your doctor if you're feeling any pain. He can give you medicines to ease your symptoms. You can do things during and after your treatment to feel stronger physically and emotionally. Eat well. You need calories and nutrients to stay strong for treatment. If it's hard for you to eat, try smaller meals every few hours instead of three big meals. Keep moving. Exercise is good for your body and your mind. Your treatment may leave you feeling tired, so be sure to balance activity with rest. Follow your treatment plan. Keep your doctor in the loop about any changes in how you're feeling. Get support. It's important to take care of your emotional health, too. Trained counselors and support groups can offer safe places to talk about how you and your loved ones feel. Also, ask for help from family, friends, and members of your community. Your outlook depends on the stage of your disease. The earlier you find and treat renal cell carcinoma, the better your progress will be. Treatment helps many people fight the cancer, and you have several good options to ease pain and other symptoms.

182,"A breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a test that is sometimes performed along with a screening mammogram in women with at least a 20% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. It is often done in women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer to measure size and extent of the breast cancer. The breast MRI should not be used in lieu of a breast biopsy to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Due to false positive results, this test may increase the number of breast biopsies that need to be performed. Although MRI may detect tumors in dense breast tissue, the presence of dense breast tissue is not a reason to have a breast MRI scan. Breast MRI scanning cannot detect tiny specks of calcium (known as microcalcifications), which account for half of the cancers detected by mammography. Talk to your doctor about whether you should have an MRI of the breasts. A breast MRI is safe. The test poses no risk to the average patient if appropriate safety guidelines are followed. People who have had heart surgery and people with the following medical devices can be safely examined with MRI: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Most heart valve replacements Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some conditions may make an MRI exam inadvisable. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions: Heart pacemaker Cerebral aneurysm clip (metal clip on a blood vessel in the brain) Implanted insulin pump (for treatment of diabetes), narcotics pump (for pain medication), or implanted nerve stimulators ("" TENS"") for back pain Metal in the eye or eye socket Cochlear (ear) implant for hearing impairment Implanted spine stabilization rods Severe lung disease Uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux (a condition causing severe heartburn) A tissue expander with magnetic port after mastectomy In addition, tell your doctor if you: Are pregnant Weigh more than 300 pounds Are not able to lie on your back for 30 to 60 minutes Have claustrophobia (fear of closed or narrow spaces) Allow 1 1/2 hours for your breast MRI exam. In most cases, the procedure takes 45 to 60 minutes, during which time several dozen images are obtained. Before a breast MRI, personal items such as your watch, jewelry, and wallet -- including any credit cards with magnetic strips (they will be erased by the magnet) -- should be left at home or removed. Hearing aids should be removed before the test, because they can be damaged by the magnetic field. Secured lockers are typically available to store personal possessions. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during your breast MRI. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound that will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should experience no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require that you receive an injection of a contrast material known as gadolinium. This helps identify certain anatomic structures on the scan images. Feel free to ask questions or tell the technologist or your doctor if you have any concerns. Generally, you can resume your usual activities and normal diet immediately after a breast MRI. Your doctor will discuss the test results with you."
183,"Psychogenic pain is a pain disorder associated with psychological factors. Some types of mental or emotional problems can cause, increase or prolong pain. A person with a psychogenic pain disorder may complain of pain that does not match his or her symptoms. Headaches, muscle pains, back pain, and stomach pains are some of the most common types of psychogenic pain. The diagnosis of psychogenic pain is made only when all other causes of pain are ruled out. A person with psychogenic pain disorder will complain of pain that does not match his or her symptoms. Medical doctors and mental health specialists working together are often most helpful to those with this disorder. Treatment for psychogenic pain may include: Psychotherapy Antidepressants Non-narcotic painkillers Ask a doctor for more information if you think that someone you care about may have psychogenic pain."
184,"When you're back home after your operation, make sure the cut made by your surgeon doesn't get infected. Get familiar with some simple rules for taking care of your healing wound. Your doctor will give you exact instructions on when and how to change it. Most wounds don't need one after a few days, but if you keep the area covered, it may help protect the cut from injury and it may heal faster. If you do keep a bandage on, change it every day. Wash your hands well with soap and water before and after. You can clean the skin around the cut with a soft cloth or gauze pad. First, soak the cloth or gauze in soapy water or in a mixture of sterile water and salt. Then, gently wipe or dab the skin around the wound. Don't use skin cleansers, antibacterial soaps, alcohol, iodine, or peroxide. They can damage the skin in the wound and delay healing. Also, don't put on any lotion, cream, or herbal product unless you've checked with your doctor first. Your doctor will tell you how to wash out your wound. He may say to fill a syringe with salt water or mild soapy water. This will help rinse away any pus that's draining out. Last, pat it dry with clean gauze or a clean cloth. Don't let it get wet for the first 24 hours after your surgery. So skip a bath or shower on the first day, though a sponge bath is usually OK. You might be able to shower by the second day, but it depends on the type of operation you had, so check with your doctor. Once you have the go-ahead to get your whole body wet, it's better to shower than to take a bath. That's because soaking your wound can soften it and may cause it to open up again. Ask if you need to put on a waterproof dressing. Don't put soap or any other bath products directly onto your wound while it's still healing. After you shower, gently pat the area dry with a clean towel. It's best to avoid movement that affects the area surrounding your wound. That way, you'll lower your risk of pulling the cut apart. Your doctor might tell you to stay away from lifting and some exercises and sports for about a month after surgery. If your cut opens up, call your doctor. Replace the bloody bandage with a new one. If you apply pressure directly to the cut for a few minutes, it will usually put an end to the bleeding. Call your doctor if it doesn't stop right away. If you have the dissolving type of stitches, you won't need to get them pulled out. They disappear on their own in 7 to 10 days. Your doctor can remove other kinds of stitches or staples in 5 to 21 days, depending on the surgery you had. Sunburn can darken a healing scar and make it more noticeable. For the first 6 months after your operation, try to keep it out of sunlight. When you're outside in daylight, cover it with tape or put on sunscreen. Call if you see any signs that you're getting an infection around your wound. Some things to watch out for: Pain that gets worse Redness or swelling Bleeding or oozing pus Increasing drainage from the wound (may become thick, tan, green, or yellow) A bad smell Your wound looks larger, deeper, dried out, or dark. Your temperature goes above 100 F for more than 4 hours."
185,"Neuropathic pain is often described as a shooting or burning pain. It can go away on its own but is often chronic. Sometimes it is unrelenting and severe, and sometimes it comes and goes. It often is the result of nerve damage or a malfunctioning nervous system. The impact of nerve damage is a change in nerve function both at the site of the injury and areas around it.  One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This rare condition occurs when an arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now misfire and cause pain. Neuropathic pain often seems to have no obvious cause. But some common causes of neuropathic pain include: Alcoholism Amputation Chemotherapy Diabetes Facial nerve problems HIV infection or AIDS Multiple myeloma Multiple sclerosis Nerve or spinal cord compression from herniated discs or from arthritis in the spine Shingles Spine surgery Syphilis Thyroid problems Neuropathic pain symptoms may include: Shooting and burning pain Tingling and numbness To diagnose neuropathic pain, a doctor will conduct an interview and physical exam. He or she may ask questions about how you would describe your pain, when the pain occurs, or whether anything specific triggers the pain. The doctor will also ask about your risk factors for neuropathic pain and may also request both blood and nerve tests. Anticonvulsant and antidepressant drugs are often the first line of treatment. Some neuropathic pain studies suggest the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), such as Aleve or Motrin, may ease pain. Some people may require a stronger painkiller. Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of the medicine you take with your doctor. If another condition, such as diabetes, is involved, better management of that disorder may alleviate the pain. Effective management of the condition can also help prevent further nerve damage. In cases that are difficult to treat, a pain specialist may use an invasive or implantable device to effectively manage the pain. Electrical stimulation of the nerves involved in neuropathic pain may significantly control the pain symptoms. Other kinds of treatments can also help with neuropathic pain. Some of these include: Physical therapy Working with a counselor Relaxation therapy Massage therapy Acupuncture Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and occasionally may get worse instead of better over time. For some people, it can lead to serious disability. A multidisciplinary approach that combines therapies, however, can be a very effective way to provide relief from neuropathic pain."
186,"Lip augmentation is a cosmetic procedure that can give you fuller, plumper lips. These days, an injectable dermal filler is the most commonly used method of lip augmentation. There are many types of dermal fillers that can be injected in your lips and around your mouth. But the most common fillers today are products that contain substances similar to hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance found in the body. It helps increase volume in your lips. These types of dermal fillers are sometimes called ""hyaluronic acid fillers."" Collagen, once the most common dermal filler, is used less often today. The newer options are safer and the effects last longer. Fat injections and implants are other methods to plump lips. But they aren't used as much today because the results vary and there is a greater risk of side effects. Hyaluronic acid fillers can improve the appearance of your lips by adding: Shape Structure Volume The effects typically last around six months. After that more injections are needed to keep the volume of your lips. There are several hyaluronic acid fillers on the market. Among them are these products: Restylane, Restylane- L, Restylane Silk Juvederm Ultra, Juvederm Ultra Plus Belotero Balance Hyla Form Elevess Prevelle Silk Captique All of these products are injected the same way and give you similar results. And some contain lidocaine, a local anesthetic. Once injected, the gel in the filler supports and shapes the tissues of the lips. The benefits of using hyaluronic acid fillers include: Control over lip volume. The amount of substance injected can be controlled, so the doctor has better control over how much lip volume is created. Gradual pace of treatment. The injections can be given gradually during different appointments until the desired results are achieved. Bumps dissolve easily. Any lumps and bumps created by movement of the lips can be dissolved easily. Less bruising. There may be less bruising and swelling compared to other dermal fillers. Reasonably lasting results. The results are reasonably long-lasting, but not permanent. Allergic reaction unlikely. Because hyaluronic acid fillers are made from substances similar to those found in the body, they are unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. But if you are allergic to lidocaine, tell your doctor before being treated. Injectable lip augmentation techniques can be performed quickly in your doctor's office with little to no downtime. Fat injection is the exception, since the procedure requires a small area of liposuction to remove the fat from another part of your body before the injection can take place. Before the injections, a topical or local numbing agent may be applied to ease discomfort. Sometimes, nerve block injections can be given before the treatment to completely numb the lips. This is similar to the anesthetic injections that you get at the dentist to numb your mouth. After carefully marking the areas to be injected, very fine needles are used to inject the substance into your lips. Following injection, ice may be given to ease discomfort and control swelling. But no firm pressure should be put on the treatment area. Lipstick or other lip products are best avoided immediately after the procedure. You should be able to notice a difference immediately. After you have healed, your lips should feel natural. Side effects of hyaluronic acid fillers are temporary and should only last a few days. They may include: Bleeding from the injection sites Swelling and bruising Redness and tenderness at the site of the injection Reactivation of cold sores or fever blisters (herpes simplex) of the lips or area surrounding the lips More serious side effects or risks may include: Severe and prolonged swelling or bruising lasting one week to 10 days Lip asymmetry (parts of lips are different sizes) Lumps and irregularities in the lips Infection Injection into a blood vessel, causing tissue loss Ulceration, scarring, or stiffening of the lip Allergic reaction causing redness, swelling, or itching around the lips Call your doctor immediately if you experience extreme swelling or develop a fever. The cost of lip augmentation varies depending on the: Type of procedure performed Doctor's experience Where you live Fillers are usually priced per syringe injected. The cost will depend on how much material is required. Most people don't need more than one to two syringes. Total costs range between $500 and $2,000. Most health insurance plans won't cover cosmetic surgery or complications associated with cosmetic surgery. Before undergoing the procedure, make sure you understand all the charges and ask if your doctor offers a payment plan. To answer this question, you must first ask yourself why you want to modify your lips. You should not undergo this procedure unless you truly want to modify your appearance. If you are considering lip augmentation to make someone else happy or to try to fit an ideal image, you may want to think twice. Also, it's important to have realistic expectations about the outcome. Enhanced lips may make your lips plumper and fuller, but you will still be you when you walk out of the doctor's office. Your doctor can discuss with you the pros and cons of your lip augmentation options and help you decide which technique or product is best for you. Before undergoing lip augmentation you should be in good health and a nonsmoker. You may not be a candidate for lip augmentation if you have: An active infection such as oral herpes Diabetes Lupus Blood-clotting problems If you have ever had a cold sore (oral herpes) any time in the past, you should tell your doctor before undergoing the procedure. If you have any known allergies or are allergic to lidocaine, tell your doctor before undergoing the procedure. Also, tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements. There are several specialists who can perform lip augmentation, including: Plastic surgeons Dermatologists Cosmetic facial surgeons The most important thing is to find a doctor who is qualified and experienced in giving injections and one whom you trust. Don't go to just anyone. Lip augmentation poses real risks, especially if the person giving the injection is inexperienced. Do your homework. When making a decision about which doctor to use, ask about the doctor's training and education. How many injections has he or she given? Is he or she board certified or a member of their specialty's medical association? Also, ask to see before-and-after photographs of patients the doctor has treated. Are you happy with the results? If you aren't, consider getting a second opinion."
187,"The earliest warning signs of testicular cancer usually include: A change in size or shape of a testicle Swelling or thickening of a testicle A firm, smooth, often painless, slow-growing lump or hardness in a testicle A feeling of heaviness in a testicle Other symptoms of testicular cancer may include: Testicular pain A sudden gathering of fluid in the scrotum An abdominal mass or abdominal pain Loss of weight or appetite Fatigue Lower back pain Tenderness in the nipples or breast enlargement Infertility Shortness of breath or cough Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the collarbone area Nausea, vomiting, and constipation You find any sort of unusual lump, nodule, pain, or swelling in either testicle. You should have a thorough physical exam as soon as possible. Remember, testicular cancer is highly curable, especially when caught early."
188,"Here's a health tip that might sound pretty good to many guys: Have more sex, or masturbate more, and you might lower your odds of getting prostate cancer. Research suggests that the more often men ejaculate, the less likely they are to have the disease. Over the years, there's been growing evidence of a link between ejaculation and lower chances of prostate cancer. But the 2016 results of a major study made the strongest case yet. The researchers asked men to answer questions about how often they ejaculated. How didn't matter -- sex, masturbation, or wet dreams were all included. Then they tracked almost 32,000 of these men for 18 years. The researchers found that guys who did it the most (at least 21 times a month) had about a 20% lower chance of prostate cancer, compared with those who did it less (4 to 7 times a month). That was true in several age groups. The exact number of times didn't matter. Basically, the more men ejaculated in a month, the less likely they were to get prostate cancer. Why might ejaculation help prostate health? Experts aren't sure. Some believe that it can flush out harmful chemicals that might build up in semen. While research is promising, there's still a lot scientists need to learn. Some things to consider: There's no proof that ejaculating more actually causes lower chances of prostate cancer. For now, doctors just know they're connected. It may be that men who do it more tend to have other healthy habits that are lowering their odds. Ejaculation doesn't seem to protect against the most deadly or advanced types of prostate cancer. Experts don't know why. Scientists don't know if ejaculation during sex vs. masturbation has the same benefits. Some research has found that the makeup of semen is different for each. For example, semen during sex has higher levels of sperm and some chemicals. It's possible that these could make a difference in a man's odds of having prostate cancer. Not all studies have found a benefit. The 2016 study got attention because of its size (almost 32,000 men) and length (18 years). But some smaller studies have not shown the same good results. A few even found that some men, specifically younger men, who masturbated more had slightly higher chances of prostate cancer. Some researchers wonder if a man's age may affect whether more ejaculation helps. Researchers are still studying the connection between ejaculation and prostate health. So doctors may not be ready to write prescriptions for â More Sex!â yet. But since masturbation and safe sex probably won't cause you any health problems, there's likely no harm in doing them more often. For cancer experts, the research is exciting because it may offer men a chance to lower their chances for prostate cancer. Most things that raise a man's odds, like age and family history of the disease, aren't things that he can change. But ejaculating more? That's a job many men are willing to take on."
189,"Here are some ways to avoid getting that raw, scratchy, burning feeling at the back of your throat. If you smoke, stop. Nonsmokers should avoid secondhand smoke. Also, take these steps to steer clear of colds and the flu, which often bring on sore throats: Stay away from people who are sick. Wash your hands often. Don't share food, drink, or utensils. Keep your hands away from your eyes and face. Eat a healthy diet. Get plenty of rest. Drink lots of fluids. The CDC recommends that everyone older than 6 months get a flu vaccine every year, too. You may also be prone to throat trouble if you have allergies or gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD). Getting treated for these problems can usually lower the number of sore throats you get, so talk to your doctor."
190,"As the name suggests, age-related macular degeneration ( AMD) is more common in older folks. But it's not just age that raises your chances of getting the disease. Some things that are linked to AMD are out of your control, like the genes that your parents passed down to you. Others, like smoking, diet, or high blood pressure, are things you can do something about. There are two types of AMD, dry and wet. Both can lead to vision problems, so learn as much as you can about the causes of the disease and the steps you can take to keep your eyes healthy. About 85% to 90% of people with age-related macular degeneration have dry AMD. The condition is linked with bits of fat and protein called drusen. They can collect under your retina -- a layer of tissue at the back of your eye that processes light. No one knows where the drusen come from, but they are thought to be pieces of waste from the retina. If you're over the age of 50 you probably have some hard drusen in your eyes. These are normal and harmless, especially if they aren't in your macula -- the small area at the center of your retina. But soft, large, and centrally located macular drusen are not. They are the ones that are linked with losing your vision. Drusen in early AMD are quite small. They get larger as the condition moves from early to intermediate to advanced. In advanced-stage AMD, drusen are larger and more numerous. They keep oxygen from reaching your eye. The vision loss from dry AMD happens slowly and usually is not as severe as that from wet AMD. But dry AMD can sometimes turn into the wet form. Up to 5% of people who have dry AMD in both eyes will get wet AMD in a year, while 13% to 18% will get it in 3 years. Wet AMD usually gets worse much more quickly than dry AMD. If you have this type, extra blood vessels start to form in your eye underneath the macula. These new vessels tend to leak blood and other fluid into your eye, which causes damage. It's not clear exactly why the vessels form, although some experts think it may be part of an effort to get rid of the drusen. Scientists have identified 20 or so genes which may be linked to more than half of AMD cases. This helps explain why you have a higher risk of AMD if other members of your family have it. But genes aren't the whole story. There are other things that may combine with genes to raise your chances of getting AMD. Age. This is the No. 1 thing that puts you at risk for AMD. About 2% of people in their 50s have AMD, and almost a third of people over 75 do. Race and ethnicity. Whites have the highest risk of AMD, followed by Chinese and Hispanic/ Latino people and, with the least risk, African- Americans. Whites are also more likely to go blind from AMD than African- Americans. About a third of whites have a gene that's been linked with AMD. If you have light-colored eyes, you also have greater odds of developing dry AMD, possibly because light eyes don't deflect ultraviolet rays as well as dark eyes. Gender. About 2/3 of people with AMD are women and 1/3 men. This may be because women live longer than men. Smoking. If you smoke, your risk for AMD could be up to four times as much as someone who has never smoked. This is probably because smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that goes to different parts of your body, including your eyes. High blood pressure. Like smoking, high blood pressure restricts the amount of oxygen getting to your eyes, which may raise your risk for AMD. Heart disease. If you've had a stroke, angina (a type of chest pain), or a heart attack, your risk for AMD may be 1 1/2 times as high as someone who has not had any of these problems. High cholesterol levels may also raise your risk. Obesity. Some studies suggest that if you have a body mass index over 30 it can more than double your chances of AMD, although this is not yet proven. Spending too much time in the sun. Long-term damage to your eyes from the sun's ultraviolet rays may raise your odds of AMD, though this is also not certain. Medications. Some drugs may be linked with chances of AMD. Those include aspirin and certain heart drugs including nitroglycerin and some beta-blockers, although this isn't certain. You should talk about the use of these medications with your doctor. Diet and alcohol. High-fat, high-sugar diets that skimp on green leafy vegetables may also add to your risk for AMD, as does having more than three alcoholic drinks a day. Cataract surgery. Your chances of getting AMD may go up if you've had this eye operation. AMD in one eye. Macular degeneration in one eye means you are more likely to get it in the other eye as well."
191,"Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) mainly causes joint pain and swelling. It can also affect other parts of your body. The symptoms can vary from person to person. They may also appear and disappear with time and treatment. You may have: Inflammation Swelling Stiffness Pain Although the condition can affect any joint, it's especially likely in your: Knuckles Toes Wrists Elbows Ankles Knees It's less common, but you can get rheumatoid arthritis in your neck, hips, and shoulders. For many people with RA, their joints are stiff first thing in the morning, and then ease up after at least an hour of movement. The condition usually affects more than one joint and mirrors both sides of the body. For instance, you might have it in both wrists. Everyone is different. Some people have mild RA. Others have severe cases with joint damage. Many people with RA have symptoms on most days. Some days may be better than others. It's rarer, but some people only have symptoms from time to time. They may have months between these flares. Rheumatoid arthritis treatments help to stop or slow the disease."
192,"This condition is also called â JIAâ, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis. (â Idiopathicâ means that the cause isn't known.) It's best to work with a pediatric rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in caring for children with arthritis and other joint problems. If there isn't one in your area, you can work with your child's pediatrician and a rheumatologist. Physical therapists, rehabilitation specialists called physiatrists, and occupational therapists can also help. The doctor will recommend a treatment plan to ease swelling, maintain full movement in the affected joints, relieve pain, and identify, treat, and prevent complications. Most children with JRA need medication and physical therapy to reach these goals. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), including ibuprofen and naproxen, and other prescription drugs, are often the first type of medication used. Most doctors don't treat children with aspirin because it could cause bleeding problems, stomach upset, liver problems, or Reye's syndrome. But for some children, aspirin in the correct dose, measured by blood tests, can control JRA symptoms with few serious side effects. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) are often used if NSAIDs don't provide enough relief. DMARDs may keep JRA from getting worse. But because they take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they're often taken with an NSAID. Methotrexate is usually the main DMARD doctors prescribe for JRA. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may help children with severe JRA. These drugs can help stop serious symptoms such as inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis). Doctors can give children these medicines for JRA directly into the vein, into joints, or by mouth. Steroids can hamper a child's normal growth and can cause other side effects, such as a round face, weight gain, weakened bones, and a greater chance of infection. Biologic drugs, which are genetically engineered, may be used in children if other drugs don't work. Injectables include adalimumab ( Humira), abatacept ( Orencia), tocilizumab ( Actemra), etanercept ( Enbrel), and canakinumab ( Ilaris). Biologics suppress the overactive immune system, targeting proteins that trigger inflammation. Your child's JRA treatment should include physical therapy. It helps keep their muscles strong so that their joints can move as well as possible. A physiatrist or a physical therapist can create an exercise program for your child. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Some alternative or complementary approaches for JRA, such as acupuncture, may help a child handle some of the stress of living with an ongoing illness. The National Institutes of Health ( NIH) considers acupuncture an acceptable additional treatment for arthritis. Studies show it eases pain, may lower the need for painkillers, and can boost flexibility in affected joints. But it doesn't stop joint damage from getting worse with some forms of JRA. Let your doctor know if you want to try alternative treatments. Your doctor can check on what's effective and safe."
193,"Eating disorders are a group of conditions marked by an unhealthy relationship with food. There are three main types of eating disorders: Anorexia nervosa. This is characterized by weight loss often due to excessive dieting and exercise, sometimes to the point of starvation. People with anorexia feel they can never be thin enough and continue to see themselves as âfatâ despite extreme weight loss. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder ( ARFID). This condition is characterized by eating very little and/or avoiding certain foods. It usually begins in childhood. People with ARFID may avoid certain foods because of their texture or odor. Bulimia nervosa. The condition is marked by cycles of extreme overeating, known as bingeing, followed by purging or other behaviors to compensate for the overeating. It is also associated with feelings of loss of control about eating. Binge eating disorder . This is characterized by regular episodes of extreme overeating and feelings of loss of control about eating. Eating disorders tend to develop during the teenage and young adult years, and they are much more common in girls and women. No one knows the precise cause of eating disorders, but they seem to coexist with psychological and medical issues such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, trouble coping with emotions, and substance abuse. For some people, a preoccupation with food becomes a way to gain control over one aspect of their lives. Although it may start out as simply eating a bit more or less than usual, the behavior can spiral out of control and take over the person's life. Eating disorders are a serious medical problem that can have long-term health consequences if left untreated. It's common for people with eating disorders to hide their unhealthy behaviors, so it can be difficult to recognize the signs of an eating disorder, especially early on. Here's a more detailed look at the symptoms of anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder. People with anorexia nervosa have an extreme fear of gaining weight. They often diet and exercise relentlessly, sometimes to the point of starvation. About one-third to one-half of anorexics also binge and purge by vomiting or misusing laxatives. People with anorexia have a distorted body image, thinking they are overweight when in fact they are underweight. They may count calories obsessively and only allow themselves tiny portions of certain specific foods. When confronted, someone with anorexia will often deny that there's a problem. The signs of anorexia can be subtle at first, because it develops gradually. It may begin as an interest in dieting before an event like a school dance or a beach vacation. But as the disorder takes hold, preoccupation with weight intensifies. It creates a vicious cycle: The more weight the person loses, the more that person worries and obsesses about weight. The following symptoms and behaviors are common in people with anorexia: Dramatic weight loss Wearing loose, bulky clothes to hide weight loss Preoccupation with food, dieting, counting calories, etc. Refusal to eat certain foods, such as carbs or fats Avoiding mealtimes or eating in front of others Preparing elaborate meals for others but refusing to eat them Exercising excessively Making comments about being âfatâ Stopping menstruating Complaining about constipation or stomach pain Denying that extreme thinness is a problem Because people with anorexia are so good at hiding it, the disease may become severe before anyone around them notices anything wrong. If you think someone you care about has anorexia, it's important to have them evaluated by a doctor right away. If left untreated, anorexia can lead to serious complications such as malnutrition and organ failure. However, with treatment, most people with anorexia will gain back the weight they lost, and the physical problems they developed as a result of the anorexia will get better. People with bulimia nervosa have episodes of eating large amounts of food (called bingeing) followed by purging (vomiting or using laxatives), fasting, or exercising excessively to compensate for the overeating. Unlike anorexia, people with bulimia are often a normal weight. But they have the same intense fear of gaining weight and distorted body image. They see themselves as âfatâ and desperately want to lose weight. Because they often feel ashamed and disgusted with themselves, people with bulimia become very good at hiding the bulimic behaviors. The following are common signs of bulimia: Evidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in a short time, or finding lots of empty food wrappers or containers Evidence of purging, including trips to the bathroom after meals, sounds or smells of vomiting, or packages of laxatives or diuretics Skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others, or eating very small portions Exercising excessively Wearing baggy clothes to hide the body Complaining about being âfatâ Using gum, mouthwash, or mints excessively Constantly dieting Scarred knuckles from repeatedly inducing vomiting If left untreated, bulimia can result in long-term health problems such as abnormal heart rhythms, bleeding from the esophagus due to excessive reflux of stomach acid, dental problems, and kidney problems. However, bulimia can be treated successfully through cognitive-behavioral therapy, certain anticonvulsant medicines, antidepressants, or combinations of these therapies. It's important to seek help if you think someone you care about has bulimia. Rather than simply eating too much all the time, people with binge eating disorder have frequent episodes where they binge on large quantities of food. Like people with bulimia, they often feel out of control during these episodes and later feel guilt and shame about it. The behavior becomes a vicious cycle, because the more distressed they feel about bingeing, the more they seem to do it. Because people with binge eating disorder do not purge, fast, or exercise after they binge, they are usually overweight or obese. Unlike other eating disorders, binge eating disorder is almost as common in men as it is in women. According to statistics from the National Institute of Mental Health, the average age at onset for binge eating disorder is 25, and it is more common in people under age 60. Common signs of binge eating disorder include: Evidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in a short time, or finding lots of empty food wrappers or containers Hoarding food, or hiding large quantities of food in strange places Wearing baggy clothes to hide the body Skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others Constantly dieting, but rarely losing weight Because binge eating leads to obesity, it can have serious health consequences if left untreated. Behavioral weight reduction programs can be helpful both with weight loss and with controlling the urge to binge eat. The stimulant drug Vyvanse is FDA-approved for the treatment of binge eating disorder. Also, because depression often goes hand in hand with binge eating disorder, antidepressants and psychotherapy may also help. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of an eating disorder is the first step toward getting help for it. Eating disorders are treatable, and with the right treatment and support, most people with an eating disorder can learn healthy eating habits and get their lives back on track."
194,"Maybe you're in the grips of a bad cold. Or perhaps you've got big plans coming up and can't afford to get sick. Either way, don't let urban legends be your source on treatment and prevention. We've got your questions covered. These illnesses are caused by different viruses. They have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. In general, cold symptoms are much milder than flu symptoms. The symptoms of a cold include things like: Sore throat Stuffy nose Runny nose Cough Mild fever The flu, on the other hand, often causes higher fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue. The cold can be caused by nearly 250 different viruses. It's just too hard for scientists to make a vaccine that protects you against all of them. Also, from a medical point of view, there's less need to create a vaccine for colds than other illnesses. Although you feel awful when you have one, they generally come and go without any serious complications. You're miserable for a few days, then it's over. It's possible, if you're sniffling but not achy or feverish. Also, if your symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, and you also have red, itchy eyes, it might be allergies. But it's often hard to tell the difference because people with allergies and asthma are more likely to get colds. They may already have inflamed and irritated lungs, so they're less able to fight off a virus. The most important thing you can do is drink a lot of fluids to keep your body hydrated. This will help prevent another infection from setting in. Avoid drinks with caffeine like coffee, tea, and colas. They may rob your body of fluids. When it comes to food, follow your appetite. If you're not really hungry, try simple things like white rice or broth. Chicken soup is comforting, plus the steam helps break up nasal congestion. Ginger seems to settle an upset stomach. A hot toddy may help you sleep, but be careful about drinking alcohol if you also take cold remedies. Over-the-counter medicines can give you relief from aches and fever: Aspirin. People under age 20 should not take it because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. Decongestants. They can help make breathing easier. But don't use sprays for more than 3 days because they can cause swelling in passageways in your nose and make your symptoms worse. Saline nasal sprays. They can also open breathing passages and may be used freely. Cough preparations. They aren't hugely effective. For minor coughs, water and fruit juices probably help the most. The FDA says that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines should not be given to children under age 4. For relief from a sore throat, try gargling with salt water. There are mixed reviews on zinc. Some studies show that zinc nasal sprays can help reduce how long your cold lasts and make your symptoms less severe. The theory? Zinc sprays may coat the cold virus and prevent it from attaching to cells in your nose, where they enter your body. Other studies show that zinc isn't helpful. And because of the risk of a loss of smell, many experts recommend that you avoid zinc nasal sprays completely. Recent studies on echinacea show that it isn't helpful in preventing colds. But in one study, 120 people with cold-like symptoms took 20 drops of echinacea every 2 hours for 10 days and had briefer colds than others. As for vitamin C, a recent look at 65 years of studies found limited benefit. The researchers saw no evidence that it prevents colds. But they did find signs that your colds might not last as long if you take vitamin C. One large study found that people who took a megadose -- 8 grams on the first day they got sick -- shortened the length of their colds. To prevent colds the natural way, it's best to make sure you've got a well-nourished immune system, your body's defense against germs. Dark-green foods like spinach are loaded with vitamins A and C. Salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which fight inflammation. Low-fat yogurt may help activate the immune system. Regular exercise also boosts the immune system. People who do it may still catch a virus, but their symptoms aren't as bad, and they may recover more quickly. Antibiotics fight bacteria, but that won't help your cold, which is caused by a virus. But your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if you have some complications. For instance, if your sinuses are blocked and can't drain properly, you can get inflammation and a bacterial infection. The symptoms may be a runny or stuffy nose, pain and pressure in your face, and a headache. Also, you can sometimes get an ear infection after a cold, and you might need antibiotics to treat it. Symptoms include ear pain, fever, or a feeling of fullness in the ears. You're contagious for the first few days of your cold, so it's best to stay home then. You need to be careful about coughing and sneezing around other people. Also, you will get better quicker if you get some rest. Your best approach? Wash your hands. Both the flu and colds are passed around the same way. Someone sneezes or coughs, and tiny droplets with a virus are sprayed onto any nearby surface -- including you! If people cough or sneeze into their hands without a tissue, they can spread the virus to every surface they touch. If you touch that same spot, you'll pick it up. If you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, you've just infected yourself. To protect yourself and prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. If you don't have that nearby, use an alcohol-based gel. Cough and sneeze into a tissue. No tissue? When you cough, turn your head away from others. If you have a sudden sneeze, bend your arm and sneeze into it. Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Wash any shared surfaces, like phones and keyboards, frequently. Viruses can live on surfaces for several hours. Stay away from crowds during cold and flu season. This is one of the most persistent myths about colds. The only way you get sick is when you come into contact with a virus. Cold air may irritate a condition you already have, like asthma, which could make your body more receptive to a cold virus. But you still need to come in contact with the virus. Kids are incredibly good at passing around a virus. They naturally breathe out more highly concentrated virus droplets than adults do. As every parent knows, children are very active, always in each other's faces. And of course, they may not wash their hands as often or as well as grown-ups."
195,"With so many over-the-counter ( OTC) allergy products in the store, it can be hard to know which one to take. Or do you need a prescription? Both prescribed and OTC drugs are regulated by the FDA to ensure that they're safe and effective when you follow the directions. But all medications have side effects. Some medications can cause problems when you're taking other medicines, too. Given all the options and things to consider, it's best to work with your doctor or allergy specialist to figure out whether an OTC or prescription medication is right for you. You'll want to tell them about your symptoms and any medicines you've tried in the past. You don't need a prescription to buy OTC medicine. For the medications that you think of as prescription, you do. Sometimes, the same drug comes in both OTC and prescription versions. The difference is often the strength. For example, hydrocortisone can treat skin reactions including itching and redness. If you're bothered by an insect bite, you can get an OTC cream or spray with a concentration of 1% or less. But for a more severe reaction like eczema, your doctor may prescribe 2.5% hydrocortisone cream or ointment. In other cases, a prescription medication works in a different way than what you can buy over the counter. If you have hay fever, you can treat the sneezing and stuffy, itchy nose with an OTC antihistamine such as cetirizine ( Zyrtec), fexofenadine ( Allegra), or loratadine ( Claritin). These block chemicals called histamines, which your body releases when your allergy is triggered. Or your doctor could prescribe a medication like montelukast ( Singulair), which blocks a different chemical so your body won't react as much. Another difference might be how long it takes for you to feel better. Those OTC antihistamines typically start working in about an hour, but it may be a couple of days before the prescription really kicks in. Most OTC medicines, including antihistamines and nasal steroids, are safe to use as directed for as long as your symptoms last, but there are some exceptions. Don't use a decongestant nasal spray for more than 3 days unless your doctor says to. It could stop working and make your stuffiness worse. Talk to your doctor about other potential risks. One study found a link between dementia and using high doses of some OTC antihistamines for many years, such as diphenhydramine ( Benadryl). When your allergies could be life-threatening or get in the way of living your life, you should see a specialist, called an allergist. You may need a prescription if your allergy symptoms are: Several months out of the year Causing a stuffy nose, trouble breathing, or sinus infections that won't go away Affecting your day-to-day activities Not controlled by OTC medications, or those medicines cause unpleasant side effects If you're taking a prescription medicine for your allergies, ask your doctor before you also take an OTC medication, especially an antihistamine, for those same symptoms. Using some medicines together can cause more side effects or even set off a dangerous reaction. Tell your doctor about everything you take: all the pain relievers, remedies, vitamins, and supplements, too. Your doctor might also write a prescription for an OTC medicine so that it's covered by your health insurance. You'll need to check the rules for your plan -- your copay and your flexible spending account or your health savings account -- to figure out what's going to cost less. Kids may be able to use the same OTC products as adults, but in smaller doses. Follow the directions on the label. Some OTC medicines are made specifically for children, like antihistamine syrups and chewable tablets. Call your child's doctor or check with a pharmacist if you have any questions."
196," If you are in a high-risk group for skin cancer or have ever been treated for some form of the disease, you should familiarize yourself with how skin cancers look. Examine your skin from head to toe every few months, using a full-length mirror and hand mirror to check your mouth, nose, scalp, palms, soles, backs of ears, genital area, and between the buttocks. Cover every inch of skin and pay special attention to moles and sites of previous skin cancer. If you find a suspicious growth, have it examined by your dermatologist. The general warning signs of skin cancer include: Any change in size, color, shape, or texture of a mole or other skin growth An open or inflamed skin wound that won't heal Melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, may appear as: A change in an existing mole A small, dark, multicolored spot with irregular borders -- either elevated or flat -- that may bleed and form a scab A cluster of shiny, firm, dark bumps A mole larger than a pencil eraser An easy way to remember the signs of melanoma is the ABCDEs of melanoma: Asymmetry, irregular Borders, changes in Color, Diameter larger than a pencil eraser, Evolution of a mole's characteristics, be it size, shape, color, elevation, bleeding, itching, or crusting. Basal cell carcinoma may appear on sun-exposed skin as: A pearly or flesh-colored oval bump with a rolled border, which may develop into a bleeding ulcer A smooth red spot indented in the center A reddish, brown, or bluish black patch of skin on the chest or back Squamous cell carcinoma may appear on sun-exposed skin as: A firm, reddish, wart-like bump that grows gradually A flat spot that becomes a bleeding sore that won't heal An existing mole changes size, shape, color, or texture; or you develop a very noticeable new mole as an adult A new skin growth or open sore does not heal or disappear in 6 weeks"
197,"Coping with irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS) presents a number of daily challenges. While there is no cure for the disorder, treatments are available. Learn as much as you can about the syndrome. It helps to talk with your doctor. Ask him or her any questions you may have about the disorder, no matter how embarrassing it might be. The more you know about your condition and the type of IBS you have, the better you can deal with it. Also, read books, pamphlets, and reliable sources of information on the Internet. Try the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders ( IFFGD) at www.iffgd.org, or call the organization at (414) 964-1799. You can find information about IBS, health care provider directories, and support networks. Keeping track of your symptoms is another helpful tool. In a symptom journal, record when and where you experienced any stomach pain, discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation. Also include what you were doing, how you were feeling, and what type of food or medications you consumed before and when symptoms appeared. All this information may help you and your doctor determine what triggers your IBS. Then you can take reasonable steps such as dietary modification toprevent problems and take control of your life. Remember, you don't have to be alone in dealing with IBS. Seek out support from trusted family and friends. "" They could be your best resource,"" says Jeffrey Roberts, founder of the IBS Patient Support Group. Roberts, who manages his own IBS, says there are times when the disorder makes him and his family late for an event because he needs to use the bathroom. Because they know about his condition, they are more understanding. At work, talking to a trusted supervisor or co-worker may make it easier for you to deal with the disorder. Let them know that you have a valid chronic illness, and when symptoms flare up, you have no control over it, suggests Roberts. This might mean bringing in educational materials about the disorder. At the same time, tell them that you've got a plan to deal with the syndrome (such as taking medication or going to the bathroom a few times), and that, despite it all, you'll remain a dedicated worker. If you have a problem with your union or boss, it might help to get a note from your doctor, explaining the illness and what might occur with symptoms. You may well find that most people are more supportive if you're honest with them, says Lynn Jacks, founder of an IBS support group in Summit, N. J. There are other sources of support if you don't feel comfortable talking with people you know. There are doctors, nurse practitioners, therapists, and dietitians who specialize in IBS and can give you valuable feedback. Ask your doctor if he or she knows of any IBS support groups. The IBS Patient Support Group has meetings online at www.ibspatient.org. Coping with IBS also takes some preparation and courage. "" You don't have to be afraid to go out,"" says Jacks. She says people may feel more comfortable if they do a little research before going to an event. "" Know where the public restroom is."" For instance, if you're going to a wedding, concert, or movie, sit at the back or end of the row for easy access to the facilities. If you go to a dinner, find out what's on the menu so that you can eat beforehand should the fare be something that would be disagreeable. Accepting embarrassing situations may also help, says Jacks. "" You have to be honest and say, ' Sorry, but I have an illness.'"" She adds: If you don't tell people, they may imagine reasons for your behavior that are stranger than IBS. And remember, it's human to have embarrassments. Situations may not be as bad as you think. You may find other people have not noticed your trips to the bathroom or that they're dealing with their own awkward issues. "" I encourage people to talk to their friends about their condition, and then they find often that (the friend) has, for example, an eczema that she's embarrassed about,"" says Mary- Joan Gerson, Ph D, a psychoanalyst and family therapist at the Mind Body Digestive Center in New York. Meditation and other stress management techniques may also be valuable in dealing with uncomfortable situations. "" When you start to get that panic feeling, you can go into that other state of consciousness,"" says Gerson, noting that regular practice of things like meditation can help you even if you're in the middle of a meeting. "" If you do meditation as a practice, you can take a couple of deep breaths and get yourself into something like that different perspective."" If you still have trouble dealing with your condition, see a therapist, advises Gerson. She and her husband, Charles Gerson, MD, a gastroenterologist, worked with 41 patients who received both psychotherapy and standard medical care. In two weeks, the patients reported a 50% improvement in symptoms. Psychotherapy is part of an approach called behavioral therapy. Other types of this treatment include relaxation therapy, biofeedback, hypnotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Indeed, there are many ways to cope with IBS. Hiding is not a good option. Roberts says people who avoid going out because of their fear get to a point where ''they feel they can't do anything,'' he says. "" You can cope,"" Roberts says. "" It's a matter of trying to live with your symptoms rather than having your symptoms take over your life."""
198," They're easy to confuse. But a dislocated shoulder and a separated shoulder are two distinct injuries. Here's the rundown. Dislocated shoulder. In this injury, a fall or blow causes the top of your arm bone to pop out of the shoulder socket. Unlike a lot of joints in your body -- your elbow, for instance -- the shoulder is incredibly mobile. You can twist and move your upper arm in almost any direction. But there's a price for this ease of movement. The shoulder joint is inherently unstable, prone to slipping out of place. In severe cases of dislocated shoulder, the tissue and nerves around the shoulder joint get damaged. If you keep dislocating your shoulder, you could wind up with chronic instability and weakness. Separated shoulder. Despite the name, this injury doesn't directly affect the shoulder joint. Instead, a fall or blow tears one of the ligaments that connects the collarbone to the shoulder blade. Since it's no longer anchored, the collarbone may move out of position and push against the skin near the top of your shoulder. Although separated shoulders can cause deformity, people usually recover fully with time. You might get a separated shoulder or a dislocated shoulder by: Falling onto your shoulder, especially on a hard surface Being hit in the shoulder Trying to break a fall with your hand Dislocated shoulders can also result from a sharp twisting of the arm. Sports that pose a higher risk of these two injuries are: Football Hockey Rock climbing Rugby Soccer Skiing Volleyball Symptoms of a dislocated shoulder are: Pain is severe in the shoulder and upper arm, making it difficult to move the arm Deformation of the shoulder -- a bump in the front or back of your shoulder, depending on how the bone has been dislocated Symptoms of a separated shoulder are: Intense pain as soon as the injury occurs Tenderness of the shoulder and collarbone Swelling Bruising Deformed shoulder To diagnose a separated shoulder or dislocated shoulder, your doctor will give you a thorough exam. You may need X-rays to rule out broken bones and other conditions. Dislocated shoulders need to be treated right away. Your doctor will need to move the arm bone back into the shoulder socket. Since the joint will get more swollen and more painful by the minute, the sooner the better. Once the arm bone is back in the socket, some of the pain will go away. After the shoulder bone is repositioned, you can use conservative treatment to reduce pain and swelling. The same treatment would also be used for a separated shoulder. To treat either injury, you should: Ice your shoulder to reduce pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every three to four hours, for 2 to 3 days or longer. Use a sling or shoulder immobilizer to prevent further injury until you get medical treatment. Then follow the doctor's advice about whether or not to use a sling. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve), will help with pain and swelling. However, these drugs may have side effects, like an increased risk of bleeding and ulcers or heart attacks and strokes. They should not be used for extended periods of time, unless your doctor specifically says otherwise. Practice stretching and strengthening exercises if your doctor recommends them. Most of the time, these treatments will do the trick. But in rare cases, you may need surgery. Surgery for severe separated shoulders is sometimes needed to repair the torn ligament. Afterwards, you will probably need to keep your arm in a sling for about six weeks. For a severely dislocated shoulder, surgery is sometimes needed to correctly position the bones. If you keep dislocating your shoulder, surgery to tighten the ligaments surrounding the joint may help. How quickly you recover depends on how serious your shoulder injury is. Separated shoulders may heal over a period of 6 weeks. Dislocated shoulders may take longer -- more like 3 to 12 weeks. But these lengths of time are just approximations. Everyone heals at a different rate. Some symptoms, like stiffness, may linger for a time. A separated shoulder can sometimes leave a permanent, but painless, bump on your shoulder. Once the acute symptoms are gone, your doctor will probably want you to start rehabilitation. This will make your shoulder muscles stronger and more limber. It will both help you recover and reduce the chances of future shoulder injuries. You might start with gentle stretching exercises that become more intense as you get better. But don't start exercising without talking to your doctor first. Whatever you do, don't rush things. Ease back into your sport. If you play baseball, start by tossing the ball and work up to throwing at full speed. People who play contact sports need to be especially careful that they are fully healed before playing again. Don't try to return to your previous level of physical activity until: You can move your injured shoulder as freely as your uninjured shoulder. Your injured shoulder feels as strong as your uninjured shoulder. If you start using your shoulder before it's healed, you could cause permanent damage. Getting back in the game early is not worth the risk of a lifelong disability. Getting a separated shoulder or a dislocated shoulder is painful and debilitating. So do what you can to reduce your chances of getting either of these injuries. Here are some tips: If you feel any shoulder pain during physical activity, stop. Exercise and stretch your shoulder muscles regularly. Ice your shoulder after physical activity if you have had a shoulder separation before. Use protective padding to protect from falls if you are at risk of a shoulder dislocation."
199,"1. Does insurance cover the cost of teeth whitening procedures? No. Dental insurance does not typically cover the cost of teeth whitening procedures. 2. How long do the teeth whitening effects last? Teeth whitening is not permanent. People who expose their teeth to foods and beverages that cause staining may see the whiteness start to fade in as little as one month. Those who avoid foods and beverages that stain may be able to wait one year or longer before another whitening treatment or touch-up is needed. 3. Do teeth whiteners damage tooth enamel? Studies of teeth whitening products using 10% carbamide peroxide showed no effect on the hardness or mineral content of a tooth's enamel surface. 4. Do teeth whiteners damage existing dental restorations? Over 10 years of clinical use of teeth whitening products containing 10% carbamide peroxide have not shown any damage to existing fillings. The issue is not ""damage"" to existing restorations; rather, keep in mind that existing restorations such as tooth-colored fillings, crowns, bonding, veneers, and bridges do not lighten. This means that any pre-existing dental work may need to be replaced to match the new tooth shade achieved in the natural teeth, should a bleaching process proceed. 5. Do teeth whiteners damage a tooth's nerve? There's no evidence to date that the teeth whitening process has a harmful effect on the health of a tooth's nerve. One study reported that at both a 4.5- and 7-year follow up, no individual who used a teeth whitening system needed a root canal procedure on any teeth that had been whitened."
200,"If you've had shingles once, you probably won't get it again. ); If your immune system is healthy: In the first several years, your chances of having shingles again are lower than it is for people who have never had shingles. Over time, your chances of a second bout go up. One study found that within 7 years, the odds of getting it again may be almost 5%. That's about the same as the odds of getting shingles the first time. You're more likely to get it again if: You had severe pain from shingles that lasted more than 30 days. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN). You are a woman. You were age 50 or older when you had shingles the first time. Your immune system is weak from conditions like leukemia, lymphoma, or HIV, or you take medicines that suppress your immune system. The CDC suggests getting the shingles vaccine Shingrix ( RZV) if you're age 50 or older. It was approved in 2017 and has been found to be more than 90% effective in preventing shingles and the complications caused by the disease. Even if you've already had shingles, the CDC says the vaccine can help prevent a second round of it. Shingrix is preferred over an earlier vaccine, Zostavax. You should also get it if you previously had the Zostavax vaccine. Talk to your doctor about when to get the vaccine. If you've just gotten over shingles, he CDC recommends waiting at least until the shingles rash has disappeared. You should not get the Shingrix vaccine if you: Are pregnant or nursing You are allergic to the vaccine You tested negative for immunity to chickenpox (varicella zoster)- If so, you should ask about the chicken pox (varicella) vaccine Since the older vaccine, Zostavax, is a live virus, You should not get it if you are allergic to the vaccine, have a weakened immune system, or are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant in the next 4 weeks. Shingles is likely to return in a different part of your body. In general, the rash is most common on the torso or face. So if you've had it on the right side of your stomach, it might come back on the left side - or on your face, chest, neck, or back. A blistering rash in the shape of a band is the telltale sign of shingles. If your immune system is weak, the rash may come on several parts of your body. Other symptoms to look out for: Pain, itching, or tingling, which may start a few days before the rash appears Headache Fever Chills Upset stomach See your doctor at the first sign of shingles. Getting treated early can help it go away faster and may help you avoid related problems. For instance, shingles on the face can cause hearing or sight problems, including blindness. If you have a weak immune system and can't get the vaccine, early treatment is your best defense against shingles. Sometimes what seems to be shingles is really herpes simplex. Though it usually appears as ""cold sores"" around the mouth or genitals, this form of herpes can show up elsewhere. A different treatment is used to clear it up. Your doctor can do tests, such as a viral culture, to confirm whether you have shingles and to get you the right treatment. As with a first case of shingles, antiviral medicines can help ease a second case. These include: Acyclovir Valacyclovir Famciclovir To relieve itching, try: Oatmeal baths Wet compresses Calamine lotion If you get PHN pain, your doctor may suggest gabapentin (an anti-seizure medicine) or a rub-on cream or lotion. Antidepressants can also help pain. Steroids are sometimes used to treat shingles. Shingles treatments like antivirals work best when you start them right away. Call your doctor as soon as a rash appears -- or you have any symptom you think may be shingles. If you had it once, you know the symptoms. That can give you a head start on the road to recovery."
201,"When you have melanoma (a form of skin cancer) that has spread to other parts of your body (which is called metastatic cancer or stage IV cancer), your doctor may tell you that you need combination therapy. This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time. This mix works well to shrink tumors, but it may also cause more side effects. Doctors are testing other forms of combination therapy for melanoma in clinical trials. Several treatments look like they may have promise. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. These treatments may be available outside of clinical trials if they prove to be worthy: A combination of immunotherapy drugs for people who have less-advanced melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for people with stage IV melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and radiation (which is called radioimmunotherapy) for people with melanoma. Right now, doctors use it to treat certain types of lymphoma, which is another form of cancer. A combination of immunotherapy and a cancer-fighting vaccine for people with melanoma"
202,"Right now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. Once a person starts showing signs â memory loss and problems with learning, judgment, communication, and daily life -- there aren't any treatments that can stop or reverse them. But there are medicines that can ease some of the symptoms in some people. They can slow down how quickly the disease gets worse, and help the brain work better for longer. It's important to talk to your doctor about which option may work best for you. Your doctor will help you choose the best treatment based on a few things about you, including: Your age, overall health, and medical history How severe your disease is How well a medicine or therapy will work for you and your lifestyle Your preferences or those of your family or caregivers Some drugs curb the breakdown of a chemical in the brain, called acetylcholine, that's important for memory and learning. They may slow down how fast symptoms get worse for about half of people who take them. The effect lasts for a limited time, on average 6 to 12 months. Common side effects are usually mild for these medications and include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, and weight loss. There are three drugs of this type: donepezil ( Aricept), galantamine ( Razadyne), and rivastigmine ( Exelon). Aricept is the only treatment approved by the FDA for all stages of Alzheimer's disease: mild, moderate, and severe. You can take it as a tablet that you swallow or that dissolves in your mouth. Razadyne (formerly called Reminyl) is also for mild to moderate Alzheimer's. You can get it as a tablet that works right away, a capsule that gives off the medicine slowly, and in liquid forms. Exelon is for people who have mild to moderate Alzheimer's. You can wear a skin patch that has the drug, or take it in capsules and in liquid form. Memantine ( Namenda)treats moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. It works by changing the amount of a brain chemical called glutamate, which plays a role in learning and memory. Brain cells in people with Alzheimer's disease give off too much glutamate. Namenda keeps the levels of that chemical in check. It may improve how well the brain works and how well some people can do everyday tasks. The drug may work even better when you take it with Aricept, Exelon, or Razadyne. Namenda's side effects include tiredness, dizziness, confusion, constipation, and headache. Namzaric . This drug is a mix of Namenda and Aricept. It's best for people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's who already take the two drugs separately. Doctors can also prescribe medicines for other health problems that happen along with the disease, including depression, sleeplessness, and behavior problems like agitation and aggression. Scientists are looking for new treatments for Alzheimer's in clinical trials. These studies test new drugs to see if they can slow the progress of the disease or improve memory problems or other symptoms. They're also looking for other ways beyond drugs to treat the disease, such as an Alzheimer's vaccine. Many people hoped that supplements such as vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, coral calcium, ginkgo biloba, and huperzine A might work well as treatments for the disease. But so far, there's no evidence that they have any effect. The results of studies on omega-3 fatty acids have been mixed, and scientists are doing more research to look into their effects on Alzheimer's. Scientists continue to look for ways to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier, before symptoms appear, which could help people start treatment sooner."
203,"Apple cider vinegar is mostly apple juice, but adding yeast turns the sugar in the juice into alcohol. This is a process called fermentation. Bacteria turn the alcohol into acetic acid. That's what gives vinegar its sour taste and strong smell. Apple cider vinegar has a long history as a home remedy, used to treat things like sore throat and varicose veins. There isn't much science to support the claims. But in recent years, some researchers have been taking a closer look at apple cider vinegar and its possible benefits. Some people say the âmother,â the cloud of yeast and bacteria you might see in a bottle of apple cider vinegar, is what makes it healthy. These things are probiotic, meaning they might give your digestive system a boost, but there isn't enough research to back up the other claims. Vinegar is used in cooking, baking, and salad dressings and as a preservative. There's a lot of acid in it, so drinking vinegar straight isn't recommended. It can cause problems, like eroding the enamel of your teeth, if you get too much. If you're looking to use it for health reasons, most people say to add 1 to 2 tablespoons to water or tea. Vinegar has been used as a remedy for centuries. The ancient Greeks treated wounds with it. In recent years, people have explored apple cider vinegar as a way to lose weight, improve heart health, and even treat dandruff. Research doesn't back most of these claims. But some studies have found that the acetic acid may help with a variety of conditions: Japanese scientists found that drinking vinegar might help fight obesity. One small study found that vinegar improved blood sugar and insulin levels in a group of people with type 2 diabetes. Vinegar also has chemicals known as polyphenols. They help stop the cell damage that can lead to other diseases, like cancer. But studies on whether vinegar actually lowers your chances of having cancer are mixed. Because of its high acidity, drinking a lot of apple cider vinegar can damage your teeth, hurt your throat, and upset your stomach. Also: Though some studies have been promising, there's still little to prove that drinking apple cider vinegar helps you lose weight. It may also cause your potassium levels to drop too low. Your muscles and nerves need that nutrient to work the way they should. Another study of people with type 1 diabetes found that apple cider vinegar slows the rate food and liquids move out of your stomach to your intestines. Slower digestion makes it harder to control your blood sugar level. It might cause some medications to not work as well. These include diabetes and heart disease drugs as well as diuretics (medicines that help your body get rid of water and salt) and laxatives. And of course, its strong taste might not be for everyone. In short, apple cider vinegar probably won't hurt you. You can try it because it's calorie-free, adds lots of flavor to food, and has health benefits. But it isn't a miracle cure."
204,"Lupus -- also known as systemic lupus erythematosus -- is a disease of the immune system. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection. In lupus, however, the immune system inappropriately attacks tissues in various parts of the body. This abnormal activity leads to tissue damage and illness.  According to the Lupus Foundation of America, approximately 1.5 million people in the U. S. have lupus. People of African, Asian, and Native American descent are more likely to develop lupus than are Caucasians. Although it can occur in both men and women, 90% of people diagnosed with the disease are women. Women of childbearing age (14 to 45 years old) are most often affected and as many as 1 in 250 people may develop lupus. The symptoms of lupus differ from one person to another. Some people have just a few symptoms, while others have many. In addition, there are many different symptoms of lupus because the disease can affect any part of the body. Some of the more common symptoms include: Achy joints (arthralgia) Unexplained fever (more than 100 F) Swollen joints (arthritis) Prolonged or extreme fatigue Skin rash Ankle swelling and fluid accumulation Pain in the chest when breathing deeply (pleurisy) A butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks and nose Hair loss Sensitivity to the sun and/or other light Seizures Mouth or nose sores Pale or purple fingers or toes from cold or stress ( Raynaud's phenomenon) Many people with active lupus feel ill in general and complain of fever, weight loss, and fatigue. People with lupus also develop specific problems when the immune system attacks a particular organ or area in the body. The following areas of the body can be affected by lupus: Skin . Skin problems are a common feature of lupus. Some people with lupus have a red rash over their cheeks and the bridge of their nose -- called a ""butterfly"" or malar rash. Hair loss and mouth sores are also common. One particular type of lupus that generally affects only the skin is called ""discoid lupus."" With this type of lupus, the skin problems consist of large red, circular rashes that may scar. Skin rashes are usually aggravated by sunlight. A common lupus rash called subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is often worse after exposure to the sun. This type of rash can affect the arms, legs, and torso. An uncommon but serious form of lupus rash results in the development of large blisters and is called a ""bullous"" lupus rash. Joints. Arthritis is very common in people with lupus. There may be pain, with or without swelling. Stiffness and pain may be particularly evident in the morning. Arthritis may be a problem for only a few days or weeks, or may be a permanent feature of the disease. Fortunately, the arthritis usually is not crippling. Kidneys. Kidney involvement in people with lupus can be life threatening and may occur in up to half of those with lupus. Kidney problems are more common when someone also has other lupus symptoms, such as fatigue, arthritis, rash, fever, and weight loss. Less often, kidney disease may occur when there are no other symptoms of lupus. Blood. Blood involvement can occur with or without other symptoms. People with lupus may have dangerous reductions in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets (particles that help clot the blood). Sometimes, changes in blood counts (low red cell count, or anemia), may cause fatigue, serious infections (low white cell count), or easy bruising or bleeding (low platelet count). Many patients do not have symptoms from low blood counts, however, so it is important for people with lupus to have periodic blood tests in order to detect any problems. Blood clots are more common in people with lupus. Clots often occur in the legs (called deep venous thrombosis or DVT) and lungs (called pulmonary embolus or PE) and occasionally in the brain (stroke). Blood clots that develop in lupus patients may be associated with the production of antiphospholipid ( APL) antibodies. These antibodies are abnormal proteins that may increase the tendency of the blood to clot. Blood can be tested for these antibodies. Brain and Spinal Cord. Brain involvement is, fortunately, a rare problem in people with lupus. When present, it may cause confusion, depression, seizures, and, rarely, strokes. Involvement of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) can cause numbness and weakness. Heart and Lungs. Heart and lung involvement often is caused by inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericardium) and lungs (pleura). When these structures become inflamed, patients may develop chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleuritis or pleurisy) and heart (pericarditis). The heart valves and the lung itself can also be affected by lupus, resulting in shortness of breath. The cause of lupus is unknown. However, there appears to be something that triggers the immune system to attack various areas of the body. That's why suppressing the immune system is one of the main forms of treatment. Finding the cause is the object of major research efforts. Factors that may contribute to the development of lupus include viruses, environmental chemicals and a person's genetic makeup. Female hormones are believed to play a role in the development of lupus because women are affected by lupus much more often than men. This is especially true of women during their reproductive years, a time when hormone levels are highest. The observation that lupus may affect more than one member of the same family has raised the possibility that the tendency to develop lupus may be inherited. Having such a tendency, however, does not predict that a relative will develop lupus. Only about 10% of people with lupus have a close relative with the disease. Drug-induced lupus can occur after the use of some prescription medications (such as hydralazine and procainamide). These symptoms generally improve after the drug is discontinued. Lupus is diagnosed when a person has several features of the disease (including symptoms, findings on examination, and blood test abnormalities). The American College of Rheumatology has devised criteria to assist doctors in making the correct diagnosis of lupus. A person should have at least four of the following 11 criteria, either at the same time or one after the other, to be classified as having lupus. These criteria include: Malar rash, a ""butterfly"" rash that appears on the cheeks. Discoid rash, red, scaly patches on the skin that cause scarring. Photosensitivity , a skin reaction or sensitivity to sunlight. Oral ulcers (open mouth sores). Arthritis, pain, inflammation, or swelling of the joints. Kidney disorder, either excess protein in the urine (proteinuria) or red blood cells in the urine. Neurological disorder, seizures, or psychosis. Inflammation of the lining around the lungs (pleuritis) or of the lining around the heart (pericarditis) Blood disorder , either low red blood cell count (anemia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), decrease in lymphocytes (lymphopenia), or decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). Immunologic disorder, including the presence of certain cells or autoantibodies, or a false-positive test result for syphilis. Abnormal blood work, a positive antinuclear antibody ( ANA) test result from blood work. An antinuclear antibody ( ANA) test is a sensitive screening tool used to detect autoimmune diseases, including lupus. Antinuclear antibodies ( ANAs) are antibodies that are directed against certain structures within a cell's nucleus (thus, antinuclear antibody). ANAs are found in particular patterns in people with autoimmune diseases (those in which a person's immune system works against his or her own body). An ANA test is done on a sample of a person's blood. The test determines the strength of the antibodies by measuring how many times the person's blood must be diluted to get a sample that is free of antibodies. Not necessarily. The antinuclear antibody ( ANA) test is positive in most people who have lupus, but it also may be positive in many people who are healthy or have another autoimmune disease. Therefore, a positive ANA test alone is not adequate for the diagnosis of lupus. There must be at least three additional clinical features from the list of 11 features for the diagnosis to be made. The type of lupus treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the person's age, type of drugs he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and location and severity of disease. Because lupus is a condition that can change over time and is not always predictable, a critical part of good care includes periodic visits with a knowledgeable, accessible doctor, such as a rheumatologist. Some people with mild features of the disease do not require treatment, while people with serious involvement (such as kidney complications) may require powerful medications. Drugs used to treat lupus include: Steroids . Steroid creams can be applied directly to rashes. The use of creams is usually safe and effective, especially for mild rashes. The use of steroid creams or tablets in low doses can be effective for mild or moderate features of lupus. Steroids also can be used in higher doses when internal organs are threatened. Unfortunately, high doses also are most likely to produce side effects. Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine). Commonly used to help keep mild lupus-related problems, such as skin and joint disease, under control. This drug is also effective at preventing lupus flares. Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide). A chemotherapy drug that has very powerful effects on reducing the activity of the immune system. It is used to treat severe forms of lupus, such as those affecting the kidneys or brain. Imuran (azathioprine). A medication originally used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. It is commonly used to treat the more serious features of lupus. Rheumatrex (methotrexate). Another chemotherapy drug used to suppress the immune system. Its use is becoming increasingly popular for skin disease, arthritis, and other non-life-threatening forms of disease that have not responded to medications such as hydroxychloroquine or low doses of prednisone. Benlysta (belimumab). This drug weakens the immune system by targeting a protein that may reduce the abnormal B cells thought to contribute to lupus. People with active, autoantibody-positive lupus may benefit from Benlysta when given in addition to standard drug therapy. Cell Cept (mycophenolate mofetil). A drug that suppresses the immune system and is also used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. It is being used increasingly to treat serious features of lupus, especially those previously treated by Cytoxan. Rituxan (rituximab). A biologic agent used to treat lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis. It is used to treat the most serious features of lupus when other therapies are not effective. The outlook for lupus varies, depending on the organs involved and the severity of symptoms. The disease often includes periods of symptoms followed by periods of remission or lack of symptoms. Most people with lupus can expect to have a normal lifespan, especially if they follow their doctor's instructions and their treatment plans. There is no cure for lupus, but there are steps you can take to improve your sense of well-being and your quality of life, including: Exercise . Low-impact exercises, such as walking, swimming, and biking can help prevent muscle wasting and lower your risk for developing osteoporosis (thinning of the bones). Exercise also can have a positive impact on mood. Get enough rest. Pace yourself, alternating periods of activity with periods of rest. Eat well. People with lupus should eat a nutritious, well-balanced diet. Avoid alcohol. Alcohol can interact with your medications to cause significant stomach or intestinal problems, including ulcers. Don't smoke. Smoking can impair circulation and worsen symptoms in people with lupus. Tobacco smoke also has negative effects on your heart, lungs, and stomach. Play it safe in the sun. People with lupus may develop rashes or disease flares when exposed to the sun. All lupus patients should protect themselves from the sun; limit time in the sun, especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., wearing sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen when you are out in the sun. Treat fevers. Take care of fevers and infections promptly. A fever may indicate an infection or a lupus flare-up. Be a partner in your care. Build an honest and open relationship with your doctor. Be patient. It often takes time to find the right medication and dosage that works best for you. Also, follow your doctor's treatment plan and don't be afraid to ask questions. Get to know your disease. Keep a record of your lupus symptoms, which parts of your body are affected and any situations or activities that seem to trigger your symptoms. Ask for help. Don't be afraid to recognize when you need help and to ask for it. Consider joining a support group. It often helps to talk to others who have been through similar experiences. If someone close to you has lupus, your life will likely be affected, as well. It is important to understand your loved one's illness and what he or she may be expecting from you. The following are some tips for living with someone who has lupus: Learn about lupus and its treatment. Understanding the illness can help you know what to expect, and provide better support and understanding. Don't push. Give your loved one enough space to deal with the illness and regain some control over his or her life. When possible, go with the person to the doctor. This is a good way to offer support and to listen to what the doctor says. Sometimes, a person feels overwhelmed and cannot take in everything the doctor says. Encourage the person to take care of himself or herself and to follow the doctor's treatment plan, but do it gently. Be patient and don't nag. Be open with the person. Talk about your own fears and concerns, and ask the person about his or her fears and needs."
205,"Most infant formulas are made from modified cow's milk. Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients are added to make them as close to breast milk as possible, and to give babies the healthiest possible start in life. But there are some babies who just can't tolerate some of the ingredients in cow's milk. Or, they may have a medical condition that requires different nutrition than a regular formula can offer. If your baby can't eat regular formula, there are other options created for babies with special nutritional needs. Before you switch formulas, check with your pediatrician. The doctor can help you find the product that's best for your baby. Soy formulas contain soy protein along with: Carbohydrates Amino acids Vitamins Minerals They're an option for babies who: Are lactose-intolerant -- meaning their bodies can't break down a sugar called lactose in cow's milk Have galactosemia -- a disorder that keeps them from breaking down a sugar called galactose in milk Are allergic to cow's milk (however, about half of babies who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to soy) There is no evidence that soy-based formulas can help with issues like colic or a stomach bug. A small number of babies are allergic to cow's milk or soy protein. If they drink cow's milk, they will have symptoms such as: Blood in the stool Diarrhea Irritability Skin rash Vomiting Wheezing These babies need special predigested formulas -- also called hydrolyzed or hypoallergenic formulas. The milk proteins in these formulas have already been broken down so baby doesn't have an allergic reaction to them. Partially hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that have been partly broken down to make them easier for babies to digest. They are sometimes recommended to prevent allergies in babies who are at high risk because they have a lot of family members with allergies. There's no evidence that partially hydrolyzed formula can prevent babies from getting allergies. But these formulas might offer some protection against the skin disease eczema. Lactose-free formula is an option for babies who can't eat cow's-milk formula because they're lactose-intolerant. This is, however, pretty rare. Although this formula is made from cow's milk, the lactose has been removed. Babies who have been sick with diarrhea may also find lactose-free formula easier to digest. Babies who were born too early (before 37 weeks) need more nutrition to help them catch up on growth. Special preterm formulas have the extra protein, calories, calcium, and other nutrients these babies need. In babies with reflux, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach hasn't developed enough. As a result, acids back up into the esophagus -- the tube that connects the throat with the stomach. Babies with reflux may: Spit up Act cranky Have trouble eating Anti-reflux formulas are made especially for babies with reflux. They contain rice starch to thicken them and make them easier for babies to keep down. Sometimes this is not enough. If your baby is having reflux symptoms, be sure to speak with your doctor. Babies who are born with certain medical conditions have special dietary needs. Metabolic diseases like PKU (phenylketonuria) prevent the baby's body from breaking down proteins. Fatty acid diseases like MCAD (medium-chain acyl- Co A dehydrogenase) make it harder for the baby to break down fats. Many different formulas are made to meet the nutritional needs of babies with these conditions."
206,"Testing yourself for colon cancer is now easier and more accurate. Cologuard is a do-it-yourself kit that allows you to collect your stool sample in the privacy of your home. The FDA approved it in 2014. How Does It Work? Once your doctor orders the test, a kit is shipped to your home. You collect a stool sample and mail it to a lab in a prepaid, pre-addressed box. The lab will then send results to your doctor within 2 weeks. What Does the Test Do? It determines if there's blood in your stool -- a common sign of colon cancer or of precancerous polyps (abnormal growths of tissue). The lab workers will also look for DNA cell changes linked to cancer. Colon cancer is preventable if pre-cancerous polyps are found and removed. Should I Take It? Men and women 45 or older need to ask their doctor what type of screening test is right for them. You should get a colonoscopy test if you have any of these risk factors: A family history of colon cancer A previous diagnosis Related diseases of the colon and rectum During a colonoscopy, your doctor will use a flexible tube and small camera to look at the lining of your colon. Experts still say the best way to screen for colon cancer and prevent the disease is to have a colonoscopy every 10 years. What if My At- Home Test Finds Cancer? If your Cologuard test has positive findings, your doctor will do a colonoscopy to confirm the results and to remove any precancerous or cancerous growths, if you have them. What if My Test Says I Don't Have Colon Cancer? You should still get screening tests. One option for colon cancer screening recommended by the American Cancer Society is a stool DNA test every 3 years. How Does Cologuard Compare to Other At- Home Colon Cancer Tests? Other at-home tests require you to prep your body. With Cologuard, you don't have to follow a special diet or take laxatives or enemas (to clear your colon) before you collect your stool sample. It's also more accurate than others. In a clinical trial that screened 10,000 people, Cologuard found more cancer cases than another commonly used test, the fecal immunochemical blood test. The April 2014 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine also showed that Cologuard found more precancerous growths. Are There Any Drawbacks? Cologuard, like other screening methods, can give incorrect results. It can indicate that you have colon cancer or precancerous polyps when you actually don't. Or it can say you don't have a potential problem when you really do, and the test just missed it. A colonoscopy can miss polyps, but the odds are very low. That's why many doctors still consider this test the gold standard. Does Insurance Cover Cologuard? In October 2014, Medicare decided to cover the test every 3 years for people ages 50 to 85. That's as long as you don't have an increased risk of colon cancer or symptoms of it. If you have private health insurance, call your provider to ask if the test is covered."
207,"The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by a clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF). This fluid is produced and stored in cavities in the brain called ventricles. It circulates around the brain, moving from ventricle to ventricle. The purposes of the fluid are to cushion and protect the brain and spinal cord, to supply them with nutrients, and to remove some of their waste products. Any excess fluid drains away from the brain and is absorbed by veins at the top of the brain.  Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is too much CSF in the ventricles. This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term ""normal pressure"" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the ""cognitive"" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known. At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor "" Getting stuck"" or ""freezing"" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who have lived through the same difficult experiences and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. To find a support group that works for you, contact the organizations listed below. You can also ask your health care provider or behavior therapist, or go on the Internet. If you do not have access to the Internet, go to the public library.

208,"If doctors tell you you're obese, they're not trying to make you feel bad. They're using a specific medical term -- obesity -- to talk with you about your weight. The word ""obesity"" means too much body fat. It's usually based on your body mass index ( BMI), which you can check using a BMI calculator. BMI compares your weight to your height. If your BMI is 25 to 29.9, you're overweight but not obese. A BMI of 30 or more is in the obese range. Obesity can help explain some conditions you may have, such as: High blood pressure Heart disease and stroke Type 2 diabetes High cholesterol Joint problems caused by extra weight Trouble breathing, including sleep apnea, in which you briefly stop breathing while you're asleep Gallstones The good news is that you can take steps to lose weight. And losing even some weight can make a big difference to your health and how you feel. You may not have to lose as much as you might think in order to start seeing health benefits. As a start, aim to lose 1-2 pounds a week. Adults who are overweight or obese should try to lose 5% to 10% of their current weight over 6 months, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. If you're ready to get started with a weight loss program, ask your doctor to help you set personal goals and refer you to other professionals who can give you tips and help you reach your goals. For example, a nutritionist can help you with a food plan, and a physical therapist or trainer can help you move more. You'll want to go for steady progress over time, and to make lifestyle changes that work for you for the long run. That way you can start losing weight and feel better."
209,"Methotrexate is one of the most effective medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis ( RA). It's the first drug most doctors prescribe after you're diagnosed. It will help ease symptoms like joint pain, fatigue, redness, and swelling. It may also help prevent damage to your organs and joints. Methotrexate interrupts the process that causes RA inflammation, which damages your joints and organs over time. Your doctor may call it a â DMARD,â which is a type of RA drug. ( DMARD stands for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). You can take methotrexate in either pills or shots. There are prefilled methotrexate shots that are easy to take at home. You will take 7.5 to 10 milligrams each week. Your doctor may raise that to 20-25 milligrams per week if needed. The pills will come with directions about how many to take and when. If you're not sure about those instructions, ask your doctor or a pharmacist. Shots work better for some people, especially if you forget to take your pills on schedule or if the pills cause nausea. Methotrexate liquid comes in vials with a hypodermic needle or in prefilled pens with various doses. You inject the drug under the skin on your stomach or thigh. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this at home. If you use a prefilled pen, you'll stick the pen into your stomach or thigh and press on it to inject the drug. Try to give yourself your shot in a different spot each time. This will help you avoid skin reactions. It can take 3 to 6 weeks to start to feel your methotrexate work. It takes even longer -- 12 weeks -- to get the full effects. Your doctor will test your blood often to check on how well your treatment works and to make sure it's safe for organs such as your liver. Your doctor may prescribe methotrexate alone. Or you may also take other drugs like aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, low-dose steroids, or other DMARDs. You'll probably take folic acid supplements along with methotrexate. This vitamin can help you lower your chance of certain side effects. Talk to your doctor before you take any drug or supplement. Not all drugs mix well. You may notice these side effects while you take methotrexate: Dizziness Drowsiness Headaches Swollen or tender gums Hair loss Decreased appetite Mouth sores Rash Diarrhea Tell your doctor if you have them. He can adjust your dose so you feel better. Minor side effects should lessen over time. This drug can harm your liver. You'll visit the doctor regularly to check on how methotrexate affects your body. Your doctor might test your liver as often as once a month for the first 6 months you take the drug. After that, you may get a liver test every 3 months. You're more likely to get an infection while you take methotrexate. So take these steps to stay well: Try to avoid people with infections like colds or flu. Wash your hands regularly. Tell your doctor if you have fever, chills, or a cough. Don't take live vaccines like the nasal flu mist, measles, mumps, or shingles shots while you take methotrexate. Methotrexate can also: Cause lung problems. Tell your doctor if you cough frequently or have shortness of breath. Make lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) more likely. Make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and don't use sunlamps or tanning beds. Cause birth defects. If you or your partner could get pregnant, you should use birth control while on methotrexate. Men should continue to use protection for 3 months after the last dose. Women should stay on birth control for at least 1 menstrual cycle after the last dose and not breastfeed while taking methotrexate."
210,"In stage 1 hypertension , also known as prehypertension, the systolic (top number) reading is 120 mm Hg-139 mm Hg, or the diastolic (bottom number) reading is 80 mm Hg-89 mm Hg. Prehypertension is a warning sign that you may get high blood pressure in the future. High blood pressure increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and kidney failure. There's no cure for high blood pressure, but there is treatment with diet, lifestyle habits, and medications. We know that starting as low as 115/75 mm Hg, the risk of heart attack and stroke doubles for every 20-point jump in systolic blood pressure or every 10-point rise in diastolic blood pressure for adults aged 40-70. Nearly half of all adults older than age 18 have prehypertension or hypertension, as measured by average of two or more readings at two or more doctor's visits. According to the American Heart Association, 59 million people in the U. S. have prehypertension. People with prehypertension may have a greater risk for other cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk factors. These risk factors -- such as high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes -- are seen more in people with prehypertension than in those with normal blood pressure. You may wonder if high blood pressure happens with aging, but experts say no. Some populations across the globe have minimal rise in blood pressure with aging. In some parts of Mexico, the South Pacific, and other parts of the world, people have very low salt intake. In these areas, the age-related rise in blood pressure is small compared with the U. S. Prehypertension is a warning sign. It means that you're at a greater risk of high blood pressure. Depending on your blood pressure and risk factors for heart disease, you may only need to make a few lifestyle adjustments. Here are some strategies to help you manage prehypertension: Lose weight if you are overweight. Being overweight increases the risk of high blood pressure. However, losing weight can lower high blood pressure. Studies show that modest weight loss can prevent hypertension by 20% in overweight people with prehypertension. Exercise regularly. Exercise helps you lose weight. Exercise also helps lower blood pressure. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and low-fat dairy . Studies show high blood pressure can be lowered and prevented with the DASH diet. This[ TM1] diet is low in sodium and high in potassium, magnesium, calcium, protein, and fiber. Cut back on dietary salt/sodium. A diet high in sodium (salt) can increase blood pressure. A low-sodium diet can lower high blood pressure -- or prevent it. Aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily (about 1 teaspoon of table salt). Eat foods low in saturated and trans fat and cholesterol. Diets high in saturated fat (meats and high-fat dairy), trans fat (some margarine, snack foods, and pastries) and cholesterol (organ meats, high-fat dairy, and egg yolks) may lead to obesity, heart disease, and cancer. Eat a plant-based or vegetarian diet. Add high-protein soy foods to your diet. Increase servings of fruits and vegetables by adding one serving at a time. You can add a serving of fruit at lunchtime. Then add a serving of vegetables at dinner. Drink only in moderation. Drinking excess alcohol can increase blood pressure. Limit drinking to no more than two drinks a day for men, and one drink a day for women. It's important to get your blood pressure checked regularly. Know your blood pressure number. Let your doctor know if your blood pressure number is higher. You can monitor your blood pressure between doctor's visits with a home blood pressure monitor. Or, you can use an electronic blood pressure monitor at your local pharmacy, grocery store, or fire station. Talk to your doctor about your blood pressure. Ask if diet and exercise can help lower your risk of getting high blood pressure."
211,"Exercise can help you lower unhealthy triglyceride levels. Start with 20-30 minutes of aerobic activity -- anything that gets your heart rate up. Do that 5 days a week, and your overall numbers may drop while your good cholesterol will rise. The best part? You reap the benefits of exercise even if you don't lose weight. Aerobic activity (""cardio"") offers the best results. Find things you enjoy, and have a backup plan for those days when your first choice isn't possible. If you haven't been active in a long time, check with your doctor first. Choose any of these: Basketball Bicycling Elliptical Jogging at a steady pace Jumping rope Kickboxing Racquetball Soccer Spinning Step aerobics Stair climbing (traditionally or on a machine) Swimming Tennis Walking briskly Zumba While working with weights hasn't been shown to lower triglycerides, it can still boost the results of aerobic exercise. Stronger muscles burn more calories all day, not just after a workout. And burning calories results in weight loss, which lowers triglycerides. If you've never lifted weights, learn proper form from a professional so you don't hurt yourself. Don't stress if it's hard to get in a 30-minute workout every day. "" You don't necessarily have to set aside a period of time when you put on your jogging shoes and sweatpants and go running,"" says Robert Bonow, MD, former president of the American Heart Association. "" You can just be active throughout the day."" Start gradually. Squeeze in 10 minutes of exercise, and build up to several times a day. Here are a few ways to add some activity into your schedule: Stand up and pace whenever you talk on the phone or while you watch TV. Challenge yourself to keep adding in steps until you get up to 10,000 steps a day. Wear a pedometer all day to track your steps. Find an app for your smartphone that offers a 10-minute workout. Once you get your exercise routine down, improve results even more with a healthy diet. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment, and enjoy better health."
212,"Many of the symptoms of breast cancer can also be symptoms of something else. Only your doctor can tell for sure. If you have any of these, make an appointment with your doctor. A lump in the breast or armpit Thickening of breast skin or tissue that lasts through your period A change in the size, shape, or contour of the breast Clear or bloody fluid coming from the nipple A change in how the skin on your breast or nipple looks or feels. It may look dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed. Redness of your breast or nipple An area on your breast that clearly looks different from any other A hard, marble-like area under the skin Your doctor will do tests to find out the cause. He or she can give you the ""all clear"" or help you start treatment if the tests show you have cancer. Most breast lumps are not cancer. But if your doctor believes it is, it's best to start treatment right away."
213,"It's important to get the right treatment for your uveitis as soon as you can. If it's not taken care of, uveitis can lead to serious eye problems, including blindness. Your treatment plan should include things to control your inflammation. Treatment can also: Ease eye pain Prevent the damage to your eyes from getting worse Help get back eyesight you've lost What your doctor will prescribe depends on what kind of uveitis you have, where it is in your eye, and if you have it in both eyes. If your first course doesn't work well, your doctor can switch you to something else. You may know these as steroids. They're probably the first treatment you'll try. They block a chemical that causes inflammation. They can be given in a few different forms. Eye drops. If your uveitis is at the front of your eye and isn't caused by an infection, steroid drops probably will be your first treatment. How often you'll put these drops in will depend on how much your eyes are inflamed. Use them until your doctor tells you it's OK to stop. You may have short-term blurred vision. Your doctor also may give you mydriatic eye drops to take with your steroids. These drops dilate your pupil, relax your eye muscles, and ease pain. They can lower your risk of glaucoma, too. Shots. You may need these if your uveitis is in the middle or back of your eye, or if your eye drops don't work. The good news is that you may only need one shot. The bad news is that you'll get it in your eye, usually on the side. Your eye doctor can give you drops to numb the area so you don't feel the shot. Pills. If your uveitis doesn't respond to drops or shots, oral steroids are an option. They can also work if you have disease in the back of your eye. They're much stronger than other forms of steroids. Take your steroid pills for as long as your doctor says. Your dose will get smaller toward the end of your treatment. If the pills don't work, you'll probably try something else. If you take steroid pills for a short time, you may have side effects. They can include: Weight gain Acne Anxiety Mood changes Sleeplessness In the long term, they can cause more serious problems like: Osteoporosis Cataracts Glaucoma Diabetes Because of all this, you'll take the lowest dose you need, and only for as long as you have to. If your uveitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection, you may need to take an antibiotic or another medication used to fight that type of infection. Once the infection clears, your uveitis should, too. It's not likely, but uveitis can happen when your immune system attacks your body by mistake. That's also known as autoimmunity. In that case, you might need to take a drug that powers down your immune system to stop the inflammation. The drugs you'd take are called immunosuppressants. They include: Azathioprine Cyclosporine Methotrexate Mycophenolate You may need to have blood tests regularly while you take these. This would be to watch for serious side effects, like liver damage. Biologic drugs target certain parts of your immune system to stop inflammation. You may need these if other uveitis treatments don't work well enough. Biologics your doctor may prescribe include: Abatacept ( Orencia) Adalimumab ( Humira) Daclizumab ( Zinbryta) Infliximab ( Remicade) Rituximab ( Rituxan) These drugs can make it harder for you to fight off infections. They also may raise your chance of having certain types of cancer. If your uveitis is severe, if it keeps coming back after treatment, or if it's caused by some infections, surgeries like these may help: Vitrectomy. Your eye surgeon can take out part of the gel inside your eye, known as your vitreous humor. Air, gas, or liquid is pumped in to replace what your surgeon takes out, but your eye will eventually fill up the space with its own fluid. You can have this under either local or general anesthesia. Implant surgery. A tiny capsule is put into your eye that slowly releases steroids to treat your inflammation. It's used on uveitis in the back of the eye that's harder to treat. The implant stays in for roughly 2 to 3 years. You might also try these therapies to ease symptoms. They won't treat the cause of your uveitis: Drugs for mild pain, like ibuprofen A warm towel over your eye to ease aches Sunglasses in bright or harsh light to cut glare"
214,"TORCH syndrome may sound like a single illness, but actually it stands for a group of infectious diseases that can cause problems -- some serious -- for your unborn baby: Toxoplasmosis Other agents (including HIV, syphilis, varicella, and fifth disease) Rubella Cytomegalovirus Herpes simplex If you get one of the TORCH infections while you're pregnant, and it spreads through your blood to your baby, he can get it, too. And because he's still developing in your uterus, his immune system most likely won't be able to fight it off. If the disease stays in his body, his organs might not develop correctly. How sick your baby can get depends on several things, including what the condition is and how far along he is in his development. But a number of problems can happen -- from jaundice (yellowish skin or eyes) and hearing problems to miscarriage and stillbirth. Toxoplasmosis is rare and it's caused by a parasite. The parasite usually gets into your body through your mouth, so you can get the disease from eating foods such as undercooked meat. If you're infected, you can pass the infection on to your unborn baby. Problems your baby can have if he's exposed to toxoplasmosis include: Brain damage Inflammation of parts of the eye, which can cause blindness Delays in ability to use muscles (motor) and other development Seizures Too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) To lower your chances of getting toxoplasmosis: Don't eat undercooked meat or raw eggs. Keep away from cat litter and cat poop. Avoid insects, such as flies, that have been around cat poop. Among the other agents included in TORCH syndrome are HIV, fifth disease, syphilis, and varicella zoster virus. HIV. Almost all U. S. children under age 13 who have HIV got it from their mothers during pregnancy. If you are HIV-positive, tests might not show that your baby has it at birth, but it can show up later, even after he is 6 months old. He might have symptoms like delayed growth, pneumonia, or swollen lymph nodes and abdomen. If you have HIV and are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, anti-retroviral medications can help lower your chances of passing the virus on to your baby. Syphilis. Pregnant women in the first or second stage of this sexually transmitted disease ( STD) pass it to their babies 75% of the time if it's not treated. Syphilis is caused by bacteria and can create serious problems during a baby's development. Many babies who get it before birth won't survive full term, or will die shortly after they're born. Almost half of babies will be stillborn. Babies born with syphilis can have misshaped bones, anemia, meningitis, skin rashes, and nerve problems that can cause blindness and deafness. If you're pregnant, you should be tested for syphilis. If you test positive, your doctor can treat it with antibiotics. Fifth disease. This disease is caused by parvovirus B19. It's seldom a problem for pregnant women or their babies. About half of women are immune to the virus, so their babies won't get fifth disease. Those babies that do can get anemia. Less than 5% of the time, women have problems that cause them to miscarry. Since there's no vaccine or medication to prevent fifth disease, it's important to wash your hands with soap and water often, and avoid being around sick people. If you're pregnant, talk to your doctor about the risks. Varicella. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus, and it also causes congenital varicella syndrome in babies. It's unlikely you would pass varicella on to your baby. Even if you have chickenpox while you're pregnant, there's still only a 2% chance you'll pass it on. However, babies born with congenital varicella can have birth defects. If you've never had chickenpox and never been vaccinated, you should get vaccinated at least a month before you plan to get pregnant. And tell your doctor if you think you've been exposed to chickenpox while pregnant. Rubella, which also is known as German measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus. If you get rubella, you'll likely have a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash. If you're pregnant and get rubella in your first trimester, it's likely that you'll pass it on to your baby. It can be very serious -- you could have a miscarriage, or your baby could have severe birth defects. The first 3 months of your pregnancy is when rubella can cause the most problems in your baby's development. That's why it's important to tell your doctor right away if you think you might have gotten it. Because of the measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR) vaccine, the disease is rare in children. There are only about 30 to 60 known cases of it each year in the United States, and fewer than five babies a year are born with it. There's no cure for congenital rubella syndrome, so prevention is key. If you're thinking of becoming pregnant and you haven't already had the MMR vaccine, you should get it at least 28 days before you conceive. Also known as CMV, cytomegalovirus is an infection in the herpes virus group. And it's estimated that 50% of adults have it by the time they're 30. There is no cure for CMV, but it gets better on its own very quickly and doesn't cause serious problems -- unless you're pregnant. If you're pregnant, you can pass it to your unborn child. In fact, CMV is the most common viral infection passed on to babies in the U. S. -- about 1 in 150 births. About 1 in 5 babies born with congenital CMV will get sick or have long-term issues from it, including: Hearing and vision loss Jaundice Small birth size Lung problems Seizures Muscle weakness Mental disabilities Like CMV, herpes is a lifelong infection, but it can be inactive for periods of time. It's also very common â more than 50% of people in the U. S. have it by the time they reach their 20s. There are two kinds of herpes: HSV-1, which can causes blisters around the mouth, but can also be passed to the genitals. HSV-2 is an STD that causes genital herpes, and can cause blisters or open sores on the genitals or anus. It can also cause oral herpes. You can pass herpes to your baby in several ways: He can get the virus while he's in the uterus. This is rare. You could have a genital outbreak during delivery. This is the most common way babies are infected. He can also get herpes while he is a newborn. The greatest risk to your baby is if you get your first outbreak of herpes while you're pregnant. That's because during your first outbreak, you shed more particles of the virus and for a longer period of time. Your body has fewer antibodies to fight the virus than it will during future outbreaks. If you're pregnant and get herpes later in your pregnancy, the chances of passing it on to your baby could be higher. Talk to your doctor about your concerns. If you have an active outbreak when it's time to deliver your baby, it may be best for you to have a C-section, and you may need to take other precautions."
215,"Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that make muscles weaker and less flexible over time. It is caused by a problem in the genes that control how the body keeps muscles healthy. For some people, the disease starts early in childhood. Others don't have any symptoms until they are teenagers or middle-aged adults. How muscular dystrophy affects you or your child depends on the kind. Most people's condition will get worse over time, and some people may lose the ability to walk, talk, or care for themselves. But that doesn't happen to everyone. Other people can live for many years with mild symptoms. There are more than 30 kinds of muscular dystrophy, and each is different based on: The genes that cause it The muscles it affects The age when symptoms first appear How quickly the disease gets worse People usually get one of nine major forms of the disease: Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) is the most common form. It mainly affects boys, and starts between ages 3 and 5. Becker muscular dystrophy is like Duchenne, except milder. It also affects boys but the symptoms start later -- between ages 11 and 25. Myotonic muscular dystrophy is the most common form in adults. People who have it can't relax their muscles after they contract. It can affect both men and women, and it usually starts when people are in their 20s. Congenital muscular dystrophy starts at birth or shortly afterwards. Limb- Girdle muscular dystrophy often starts in a person's teens or 20s. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. It can affect anyone from teenagers to adults in their 40s. Distal muscular dystrophy affects the muscles of the arms, legs, hands, and feet. It usually comes on later in life, between ages 40 and 60. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy starts in a person's 40s or 50s. It causes weakness in the muscles of the face, neck, and shoulders, and droopy eyelids (ptosis), followed by difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Emery- Dreifuss muscular dystrophy affects mainly boys, usually starting around age 10. People with this form often have heart problems along with muscle weakness. There are many treatments that can help keep muscles strong and flexible, and scientists are looking for new ones, too. The important thing is to get the treatment you need and find support. Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first one in your family to have it. The condition is caused by problems in your genes. Genes contain the information your cells need to make proteins that control all of the different functions in the body. When a gene has a problem, your cells can make the wrong protein, the wrong amount of it, or a damaged protein. You can get muscular dystrophy even if neither of your parents had the disease. This happens when one of your genes gets a defect on its own. But it's rare for someone to get it this way. In people with muscular dystrophy, the broken genes are the ones that make the proteins that keep muscles healthy and strong. For example, those with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies make too little of a protein called dystrophin, which strengthens muscles and protects them from injury. For most types of muscular dystrophy, symptoms start to show up in childhood or in the teen years. In general, children with the condition: Fall down often Have weak muscles Have muscle cramps Have trouble getting up, climbing stairs, running, or jumping Walk on their toes or waddle Some will also have symptoms like: A curved spine (called scoliosis) Droopy eyelids Heart problems Trouble breathing or swallowing Vision problems Weakness in the muscles of the face Your doctor will need to check different parts of your child's body to know if he has muscular dystrophy. He'll start with a general physical exam. He'll also ask you questions about your family's medical history and the kind of symptoms you're noticing in your child. He may ask: Which muscles seem to be giving him trouble? Does he have a hard time walking or doing his usual activities? How long has this been happening? Does anyone in your family have muscular dystrophy? What kind? He also may ask you questions about how your child plays, moves, and speaks, as well as how he acts at home and at school. The doctor may use different tests to check for conditions that can cause muscle weakness. Blood tests. They check for levels of certain enzymes that muscles release when they are damaged. Electromyography, or EMG. Your doctor will put small needles, called electrodes, on different parts of your child's body and ask him to slowly flex and relax his muscles. The electrodes are attached with wires to a machine that measures electrical activity. Muscle biopsy. Using a needle, your doctor removes a small piece of your child's muscle tissue. He'll look at it under a microscope to see which proteins might be missing or damaged. This test can show the type of muscular dystrophy your child may have. Tests of muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. These help doctors rule out other problems with his nervous system. Electrocardiogram or EKG . It measures electrical signals from the heart and tells how fast your child's heart is beating and if it has a healthy rhythm. Imaging can show the quality and amount of muscle in your child's body. He may get: MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of his organs. Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors can also test a sample of his blood to look for the genes that cause muscular dystrophy. Genetic tests can help diagnose the condition, but they're also important for people with a family history of the disease who are planning to start a family. You can talk with your doctor or a genetics counselor to find out what the results of this test mean for you and your children. You'll want to find out as much about your child's condition as you can to learn how he can stay as healthy as possible. You may want to ask: What kind of muscular dystrophy does he have? Does he need any more tests? Do we need to see any other doctors? How will the disease affect his life? What kinds of treatments are available? How will they make him feel? What can I do to keep his muscles strong? Are there any clinical trials that would be good for him? Will my other children get muscular dystrophy? Right now, there's no cure for the disease. But there are many treatments that can improve symptoms and make life easier for you and your child. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on the type of muscular dystrophy your child has. Some of them are: Physical therapy uses different exercises and stretches to keep muscles strong and flexible. Occupational therapy teaches your child how to make the most of what his muscles can do. Therapists can also show him how to use wheelchairs, braces, and other devices that can help him with daily life. Speech therapy will teach him easier ways to talk if his throat or face muscles are weak. Respiratory therapy can help if your child is having trouble breathing. He'll learn ways to make it easier to breathe, or get machines to help. Medicines can help ease symptoms. Eteplirsen ( Exondys 51) has been approved to treat DMD. It is an injection medication that helps treat individuals with a specific mutation of the gene that leads to DMD. The most common side effects are balance problems and vomiting. Although the drug increases dystrophin production, which would predict improvement in muscle function, this has not yet been shown. Anti-seizure drugs reduce muscle spasms. Blood pressure medicines help with heart problems. Drugs that turn down the body's immune system, called immunosuppressants, may slow damage to muscle cells. Steroids like prednisone and defkazacort ( Emflaza) slow down muscle damage and can help your child breathe better. They can cause serious side effects, such as weak bones and a higher risk of infections. Creatine, a chemical normally found in the body, can help supply energy to muscles and improve strength for some people. Ask your child's doctor if these supplements are a good idea for him. Surgery can help with different complications of muscular dystrophy, like heart problems or trouble swallowing. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat muscular dystrophy in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for your child. It's hard when your child loses strength and can't do the things other kids can do. Muscular dystrophy is a challenge, but it doesn't have to keep your child from enjoying life. There are many things you can do to help him feel stronger and get the most out of life. Eat right. A healthy, well-balanced diet is good for your child in general. It's also important for helping him stay at a healthy weight, which can ease breathing problems and other symptoms. If it's hard for him to chew or swallow, talk to a dietitian about foods that may be easier to eat. Stay active. Exercise can improve your child's muscle strength and make him feel better. Try low-impact activities like swimming. Get enough sleep. Ask your doctor or therapist about certain beds or pads that can make your child more comfortable and rested. Use the right tools. Wheelchairs, crutches, or electric scooters can help your child if he has trouble walking. The disease will most likely have a big impact on your family. Remember that it's OK to ask a doctor, counselor, family, or friends for help with any stress, sadness, or anger you may feel. Support groups are also good places to talk to other people who have lived with muscular dystrophy. They can help your child connect with others like him and give you and your family advice and understanding. Muscular dystrophy is different for everyone. Some children may lose muscle strength very slowly, giving them and their families time to adjust to the changes. Others will get worse more quickly. Many people with the disease will need wheelchairs and help with daily living at some point, but that's not always the case. Talk to your doctor about your child's muscular dystrophy. Together, you can make the best possible treatment plan for him and get the support you need for your family.

216,"This rare type of severe headache comes on suddenly. It can cause intense pain and often nausea and vomiting. If you have one, get emergency medical attention. The cause, which can be life-threatening, is often some kind of bleeding in or around your brain. People often call this the first worst headache of their life. It comes out of nowhere. The pain peaks within a minute, lasts about 5 minutes, and then goes away. Take a sudden new headache seriously. It's often the only warning you get of a serious problem. Unlike a migraine, thunderclap headaches seem to come on suddenly. The pain grabs your attention in the same way a clap of thunder does. You can feel pain anywhere on your head or neck. You may even feel it in your back. You might also have several other symptoms, including: Changes in vision Confusion Nausea Numbness Vomiting Weakness Fever Seizures Thunderclap headaches could be caused by bleeding from an artery into the space surrounding your brain. This is known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Arteries are vessels that supply blood to your brain. A thunderclap headache could also be caused by any of the following: Small tears in the arteries of your head or neck A burst artery or aneurysm, which is a swollen, weak area in the artery Blocked veins in your head Leaking spinal fluid Rapid changes in blood pressure An infection in your brain Head injury Hemorrhagic stroke ( This comes from a ruptured blood vessel in your brain.) Ischemic stroke ( This comes from a blocked blood vessel, due to a blood clot, or plaque.) Narrowed blood vessels surrounding the brain Inflamed blood vessels Extremely high blood pressure in late pregnancy Some activities such as the following could trigger a thunderclap headache: Hard physical labor Taking certain drugs, including illegal ones Hitting warm or hot water too fast, such as when you first enter a shower or bath Your doctor will probably ask you questions, like: Have you had other headaches like this? Have you had other types of headaches before? If so, were they continuous or occasional? Describe the headaches and their symptoms How severe were your headaches? Does anything make them better? Does anything make them worse? Your doctor will also use tests like: CT scan of the head. This imaging test takes X-rays that create slice-like, cross-sectional images of your brain and head. A computer combines them to create a full picture of your brain. The doctor might inject an iodine-based dye into your veins to make parts of your brain stand out. Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). If you need this test, the doctor will take out a small amount of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. He can test it for signs of bleeding or infection. MRI. This imaging test is often used as a follow-up to a CT scan. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the inside of your brain. Magnetic resonance angiography. MRI machines can be used to map the blood flow inside your brain in a test called a magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA). Thunderclap headache treatment depends on what's causing the pain."
217,"For a parent, discovering that your child is entering puberty early can be alarming. Why is it happening? Can your child really handle the effects -- both physical and psychological? Many kids who have early puberty don't need treatment. In those who do, treatment usually works well in halting the process. Here are some basic facts about the causes of early puberty and the ways it might affect your child. Puberty starts on average in girls between ages 8 and13 and in boys between ages 9 and 14. Doctors diagnose early puberty when this normal process starts early and continues to progress through growth spurts and bone maturation, usually for reasons we don't understand. Girls who show significant signs of puberty and its progression before age 8 and boys before age 9 are considered precocious. About 1 out of 5,000 children are affected. There are two types of precocious puberty, central and peripheral. Central precocious puberty is the more common type. The process is identical to normal puberty, but happens early. The pituitary gland is prompted to produce hormones, called gonadotropins. These hormones in turn stimulate the testicles or ovaries to make other hormones, testosterone or estrogen. It's these sex hormones that cause the changes of puberty, like breast development in girls. Peripheral precocious puberty or precocious pseudo-puberty is a different condition. It's also rarer. The hormones estrogen and testosterone trigger the symptoms. But the brain and pituitary gland are not involved. It's usually a local problem with the ovaries, testicles, adrenal gland, or a severely underactive thyroid gland. There are other conditions that might look like early puberty to parents -- and sometimes even to pediatricians -- but aren't. Premature thelarche is early breast development at a young age. It often appears in girls who are just a few years old. While troubling for parents, it resolves on its own and is not true early puberty. It does not require treatment but should be evaluated. Premature pubarche is the early development of some pubic or underarm hair at an early age. It can be caused by premature adrenarche, when the adrenal glands start releasing hormones early. Again, while it might seem alarming, it's generally not a problem and not an early sign of puberty. However, because this may represent the first sign of an abnormal and excess release of adrenal hormones, it should be evaluated. Many experts say that, on average, puberty is starting earlier in the U. S. than it did in the past. The average age of menstruation has stayed roughly the same. Yet studies suggest that early signs -- like breast development -- are happening a year earlier than they did decades ago. The signs of early puberty and puberty are usually the same. It's the timing that's different. Signs include: In girls Breast development (which is often the first sign) Menstruation (typically not until two to three years after the earlier symptoms start) In boys Growth of the testicles, penis, and scrotum A deepening voice (usually late signs of puberty) Growth spurts are another sign of early puberty in both boys and girls. In most cases, experts don't know what causes central precocious puberty, particularly in girls. Sometimes, central precocious puberty is triggered by a medical problem. Underlying causes are equally common in boys and children under age 6, especially if puberty is advancing rapidly. They can include: Tumors and other growths, which are often benign Brain injury, either from surgery or a blow to the head, that affects hormonal balances Inflammation of the brain, sometimes from an infection That probably looks like a worrisome list. Just remember that only in a small number of cases in boys is central precocious puberty caused by a medical problem. In girls, it is extremely rare for a medical problem to be the cause. While they aren't necessarily causes, a number of factors seem to be related to early puberty. They include: Gender. Girls are 10 times as likely to have central precocious puberty as boys. Genetics. Occasionally, precocious puberty can be triggered by genetic mutations that trigger the release of sex hormones. Most often these children have a parent or sibling with similar genetic abnormalities. Race. Researchers don't know why, but on average, African- American girls seem to start puberty about a year earlier than white girls. Some experts say that puberty should only be considered early in African- American girls if it happens before age 6. International adoption. One study showed that children who are adopted from overseas are 10-20 times more likely to develop precocious puberty. Again, experts aren't sure why, but the uncertainty of the exact ages of the adopted children might bias the study results. Obesity. A number of studies have shown an association between obesity in young girls and an increased risk of precocious puberty. However, researchers don't know how direct the link is. Obesity does not seem to be connected to early puberty in boys. For kids, early puberty can cause physical and emotional problems. They include: Short stature. While kids with precocious puberty are often tall for their age, some wind up short as adults. Why? Once puberty is over, growth stops. Since precocious puberty ends earlier than normal puberty, these kids stop growing at an earlier age -- and sometimes, the end result may be a shorter height than they would have otherwise had. Behavior problems. Some studies have found an association between early puberty and behavior problems, particularly in kids with developmental delays. However, many experts consider the evidence weak. Early sexual activity. Although parents might worry, there's not strong evidence that kids with early puberty are likelier to be sexually active at a younger age. Stress. Even when it's happening to average 12-year-olds, puberty can be a confusing time. It can be all the more stressful for younger kids with early puberty. They might feel awkward about looking different from their peers. Early menstruation can be unsettling for girls who are age 9 or younger -- or who are developmentally delayed. Parents can help by educating their kids about what changes they should expect. Other risks. Some studies have found a link between early puberty in girls and a slightly increased risk of breast cancer later in life. However, the evidence is not clear. More research needs to be done. As a parent, it's easy to worry about early puberty. There's no doubt that you should take any signs seriously. If your child shows signs of early puberty, they should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist. But kids and their parents should not view precocious puberty as a fearful medical diagnosis. Here are a few other things to remember: Symptoms that might seem like early puberty are often unrelated and resolve on their own. When a doctor and parents decide treatment is necessary, it is usually quite effective. Most kids with signs of early puberty do fine, medically, psychologically, and socially."
218,"If you have diabetes and you hurt when you move, it might be due to problems with your tendons. They're cord-like bands that connect your muscles to your bones. The high blood sugar levels that may go along with your disease play a role in stirring up your tendon trouble. You have tendons all over your body, including in your shoulders, arms, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. They transfer the force from your muscles to your bones so you can move. If your diabetes isn't under control, your tendons can thicken and become more likely to tear. Tendon damage in type 1 and type 2 diabetes happens because of substances called advanced glycation end products ( AGEs). They form when protein or fat mixes with sugar in your bloodstream. Normally, your body makes AGEs at a slow and steady pace. But when you have diabetes, the extra sugar in your blood cranks up the speed, which affects your tendons. Tendons are made from a protein called collagen. AGEs form a bond with it that can change the tendons' structure and affect how well they work. For instance, they could get thicker than normal and might not be able to hold as much weight as they used to. As a result, your odds of getting a tear in one of your tendons go up. Some tendon problems you could get if you don't get your diabetes under control are: Frozen shoulder: Stiffness and pain that happens when a capsule that surrounds tendons and ligaments in your joint thickens up. Rotator cuff tears: Damage to the tendons and muscles that surround your shoulder joint, including the supraspinatus muscle. Trigger finger: Your finger becomes stuck in a bent position and straightens with a snap, like the sound of a trigger being pulled. Carpal tunnel syndrome: You get numbness, tingling, and weakness in your wrist because of pressure on the nerve that runs through it. Dupuytren's contracture: Thickening of the tissue under the skin of your hand that causes your fingers to bend in toward your palm. Tendon damage is painful and can hinder how much you can move your joint. Even if you have surgery to fix the damage, the tendon can tear again. Studies show that more than a third of people with diabetes who have surgery to fix a torn rotator cuff will get the problem again. Exercise is important to help keep your diabetes under control, but you may find it harder to work out when your tendons are painful and stiff. Damage to the Achilles tendon in the back of your heel can put a cap on how much you can move your ankle. This limited motion forces you to put extra pressure on the middle of your foot with each step, which increases your risk for foot sores. Talk to your doctor about ways to make sure your blood sugar levels stay down while you recover from tendon problems. The best way to avoid tendon problems is to get your diabetes under control. Lower your blood sugar with the help of diet, exercise, and medicine. And if you're overweight, try to shed some pounds. It will improve your health and take pressure off your tendons at the same time. If you already have tendon damage, ask your doctor about treatments like these: Pain relievers such as aspirin or ibuprofen Muscle relaxants Physical therapy and exercise Heat or ice A splint to keep your joint steady while your tendons heal Your doctor may also suggest a steroid shot into your joint to relieve tendon problems. Keep in mind that steroids can cause a short-term spike in your blood sugar levels. Ask your doctor whether the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks."
219,"Nearly everyone has had sore eyes at some point. Sometimes they get better on their own, but they can also be a sign of something more serious. Your eye doctor can figure out what's going on and find the right treatment for you. Sometimes discomfort or pain results from a problem in your eye or the parts around it, such as: Cornea: The clear window in the front of your eye that focuses light Sclera: The whites of your eyes Conjunctiva: The ultra-thin covering of your sclera and the inside of your eyelid Iris: The colored part of your eye, with the pupil in the middle Orbit: A bony cave (eye socket) in your skull where the eye and its muscles are located. Extraocular muscles: They rotate your eye. Nerves: They carry visual information from your eyes to your brain. Eyelids: Outside coverings that protect and spread moisture over your eyes. Blepharitis: An inflammation or infection of the eyelid which typically is not painful Conjunctivitis (pinkeye): This is inflammation of the conjunctiva. It can be from allergies or infections (viral or bacterial). Blood vessels in the conjunctiva swell. This makes the part of your eye that's usually white look red. Your eye could also get itchy and gunky. This condition is typically not painful. Corneal abrasions: That's the official name for a scratch on this part of your eye. It sounds minor, but it can hurt. It's easy to do, too. You can scratch your eye while rubbing it. Your doctor will give you antibiotic drops. It should get better in a couple of days without further problems. Corneal infections (keratitis): An inflamed or infected cornea is sometimes caused by a bacterial or viral infection. You may be more likely to get it if you leave your contacts in overnight or wear dirty lenses. Foreign bodies: Something in your eye, like a bit of dirt, can irritate it. Try to rinse it out with artificial tears or water. If you don't get it out, it can scratch your eye. Glaucoma: This family of conditions causes fluid to build up in your eye. That puts pressure on your optic nerve. If you don't treat it, you could lose your sight. Most of the time there are no early symptoms. But a type called acute angle-closure glaucoma causes pressure inside your eye to rise suddenly. Symptoms include severe eye pain, nausea and vomiting, headache, and worsening vision. This is an emergency. You need treatment ASAP to prevent blindness. Iritis or uveitis: An inflammation inside your eye from trauma, infections, or problems with your immune system. Symptoms include pain, red eye, and, often, worse vision. Optic neuritis: An inflammation of the nerve that travels from the back of the eyeball into your brain. Multiple sclerosis and other conditions or infections are often to blame. Symptoms include loss of vision and sometimes deep discomfort when you look from side to side. Sinusitis: An infection in one of your sinuses. When pressure builds up behind your eyes, it can cause pain on one or both sides. Stye: This is a tender bump on the edge of your eyelid. It happens when an oil gland, eyelash, or hair follicle gets infected or inflamed. You may hear your doctor call it a chalazion or hordeolum. Eye pain can happen on its own or with other symptoms, like: Less vision Discharge: It can be clear or thick and colored Foreign body sensation -- the feeling that something is in the eye, whether real or imagined Headache Light sensitivity Nausea or vomiting Red eye or pinkeye Tearing Your eye is crusted shut with discharge when you wake up. Other symptoms along with sore eyes can be a clue to what is causing the pain. See your eye doctor if you have eye pain, especially if you have less vision, headache, or nausea and vomiting. Eye doctors use a variety of tools to diagnose eye pain: A slit-lamp exam uses bright light to look at all the structures of your eye. Dilating drops expand your pupil to let the doctor see deep into your eye. A tonometer is a tool that measures eye pressure. The doctor uses it to diagnose glaucoma. Just as causes can vary, so do treatments. They target the specific cause of eye pain. Conjunctivitis: Antibacterial eyedrops can cure bacterial conjunctivitis. Antihistamines in the form of eyedrops, a pill, or a syrup can improve conjunctivitis from allergies. Corneal abrasions: These heal on their own with time. Your doctor might prescribe an antibiotic ointment or drops. Glaucoma: You'll get eyedrops and maybe pills to reduce pressure. If they don't work, you may need surgery. Infected cornea: You may need antiviral or antibacterial eyedrops. Iritis: The doctor will treat this with steroid, antibiotic, or antiviral eyedrops. Optic neuritis: It's treated with corticosteroids. Styes: Use warm compresses at home for a few days. The only way to sort out the causes of eye pain and to get the right treatment is to see a doctor. Your vision is precious. Protect it by taking eye pain seriously."
220,"If you've noticed that your gums are a little red and sore, don't brush it off. You might have gingivitis, the first sign of gum disease. Most people get gingivitis at some point in their lives, and its mild symptoms make it easy to ignore. But without treatment, it can turn into bigger problems for your mouth. The good news is you can reverse or even prevent it by simply brushing your teeth, flossing, and maintaining regular dental cleanings and check-ups. When you forget to brush, floss, and rinse with mouthwash, a sticky film of bacteria and food called plaque builds up around your teeth. The gunk releases acids that attack your teeth's outer shell, called enamel, and cause decay. After 72 hours, plaque hardens into tartar, which forms along the gum line and makes it hard to clean your teeth and gums completely. Eventually this buildup irritates and inflames your gums, causing gingivitis. You can have gingivitis and not know it. Over time you may notice: Red, swollen, or purplish gums. Healthy gums should appear pink and firm. Bleeding gums. You may see blood on your toothbrush or when you spit out toothpaste. Sore gums that are tender to the touch If you think you may have gingivitis, you can take some simple steps to reverse it. Start by looking at your oral health habits to figure out where you could do better. Do you always skip brushing before bed or forget to floss? If so, put reminder notes on the bathroom mirror. Mouthwash is a big help in treating the disease. Make sure you use one that's labeled as antigingivitis, antibacterial, or antiseptic. If you can't remember which kind to buy, ask a pharmacist for help. If it's been 6 months since you last saw the dentist, set up a cleaning to remove tartar and plaque buildup from your teeth. Ask your dentist about the proper way to brush -- bearing down too hard or missing spots can lead to gingivitis. After a cleaning, your gums should get better within a week or so as long as you brush twice a day, and floss and rinse once a day. To keep your mouth healthy, the American Dental Association says you should: 1. Brush your teeth twice a day. Use a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste. Replace your toothbrush every 3 months or sooner if the bristles become frayed. Old, worn out ones won't clean teeth as well. 2. Floss every day. Don't wait until something gets stuck between your teeth. Daily flossing gets plaque out of places your toothbrush can't reach. Don't like flossing? Try interdental cleaners, picks, or small brushes that fit in between teeth. Ask your dentist how to use them so you don't damage your gums. 3. Rinse your mouth out. Antibacterial mouthwash not only prevents gingivitis, it fights bad breath and plaque. Ask your dentist which mouthwash would work best for you. 4. Visit your dentist every 6 months. Once tartar forms on your teeth, only your dentist or hygienist can remove it. Depending on your overall oral health and risk factors, you may need to see him more often. 5. Eat healthy foods. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches from food, fueling them to release the acids that attack tooth enamel. Junk food and candy have a lot of extra sugar and starch. Avoid them to keep your teeth and gums healthy. 6. If you smoke, quit. Not only is smoking bad for your heart and lungs, it can also harm your teeth and gums. Smoking or using smokeless tobacco can make you more likely to get severe gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss. Brush, floss, rinse, and repeat. Gingivitis can come back any time. So build good oral care habits, and stick with them."
221,"Your health care team helps you manage your diabetes and maintain your good health. According to the American Diabetes Association, your diabetes care team should include: You: You are the most important member of your diabetes care team! Only you know how you feel. Your diabetes care team will depend on you to talk to them honestly and supply information about your body. Monitoring your blood sugar tells your doctors whether your current treatment is controlling your diabetes well. By checking your blood sugar levels, you can also prevent or reduce the episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) you have. Primary doctor: Your primary care doctor is who you see for general checkups and when you get sick. This person is usually an internist or family medicine doctor who has experience treating people with diabetes, too. Because your primary care doctor is your main source of care, he or she will most likely head up your diabetes care team. Endocrinologist: An endocrinologist is a doctor who has special training and experience in treating people with diabetes. You should see yours regularly. Dietitian: A registered dietitian ( RD) is trained in the field of nutrition. Food is a key part of your diabetes treatment, so yours will help you figure out your food needs based on your weight, lifestyle, medication, and other health goals (like lowering blood fat levels or blood pressure). Nurse educator: A diabetes educator or diabetes nurse practitioner is a registered nurse ( RN) with special training and background in caring for and teaching people with diabetes. Nurse educators often help you with the day-to-day aspects of living with diabetes. Eye doctor: Either an ophthalmologist (a doctor who can treat eye problems both medically and surgically) or an optometrist (someone who is trained to examine the eye for certain problems, such as how well the eye focuses; optometrists are not medical doctors) should check your eyes at least once a year. Diabetes can affect the blood vessels in the eyes, which can lead to losing your sight. Podiatrist: For anyone with diabetes, which can cause nerve damage in the extremities, foot care is important. A podiatrist is trained to treat feet and problems of the lower legs. These doctors have a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine ( DPM) degree from a college of podiatry. They have also done a residency (hospital training) in podiatry. Dentist: People with diabetes are at somewhat greater, and earlier, risk of gum disease. The excess blood sugar in your mouth makes it a nice home for bacteria, which can lead to infection. You should see your dentist every 6 months. Be sure to tell your dentist that you have diabetes. Exercise trainer: No matter what kind of diabetes you have, exercise should play a major role in managing it. The best person to plan your fitness program, along with your doctor, is someone trained in the scientific basis of exercise and in safe conditioning methods. People with diabetes who use insulin shots usually see their doctor at least every 3 to 4 months. People who take pills or who are managing their diabetes through diet alone should have an appointment at least every 4 to 6 months. You may need to go more often if your blood sugar isn't controlled or if your complications are getting worse. Generally, your doctor wants to understand how well your diabetes is controlled and whether diabetic complications are starting or getting worse. Therefore, at each visit, give your doctor your home blood sugar monitoring record and tell him about any symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Also let your doctor know about any changes in your diet, exercise, or medicines and any new illnesses you may have gotten. Tell your doctor if you've had symptoms of eye, nerve, kidney, or cardiovascular problems such as: Blurred vision Numbness or tingling in your feet Persistent hand, feet, face, or leg swelling Cramping or pain in the legs Chest pain Shortness of breath Numbness or weakness on one side of your body Unusual weight gain When you have diabetes, you should get regular lab tests: Hemoglobin A1c Urine and blood tests for kidney function Lipid testing, which includes cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL You may need thyroid and liver tests, too."
222,"What's ""best"" among birth control methods differs from person to person. What's right for you may not be right for everyone. And your needs may change over time, too. You should think about: How fail-proof do you need your protection plan to be? How much does the cost matter? How important is your privacy? Do you have a regular partner whose needs you care about? Do you need to protect against sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs)? How much effort do you want to make to prevent a pregnancy? If you're a woman, does it matter if your period is affected? Will you some day want to have a child? You can compare facts about birth control methods in the sections below, including the basic ways they work. Behavior: Something you or your partner has to do Barrier: Goes on or in your body before you have sex to block the sperm from getting to the egg Hormonal: Changes a woman's body chemistry. ( Depending on the specific hormones, it stops ovaries from releasing eggs, thickens the mucus around your cervix to keep sperm from reaching the egg, or thins the lining of the uterus.) Medical: A procedure that changes your body When doctors talk about how effective a birth control method is, sometimes there are different rates when it's used ""ideally"" -- meaning exactly the way it was designed -- versus how the average person uses it in real life. "" Typical"" use takes into account that people can't or don't always use birth control correctly or consistently. Keep in mind, out of every 100 women who don't use any form of birth control, you can expect about 85 to get pregnant within a year.

223,"The person is experiencing tingling. There is numbness or weakness in the hand or arm. The injury is near the sternum and the person is having shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing. Get the person to a hospital emergency room or to a health care provider. Avoid moving the affected arm. Hold the arm close to the body with the other arm or a sling with the hand raised higher than the elbow. Apply ice for pain and swelling. Give over-the-counter acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) for pain unless there is a break in the skin over the fracture, which may require surgery. The health care provider will examine the shoulder and may X-ray the shoulder and chest. The health care provider may put the arm in a sling to immobilize it and apply a figure eight strap to help maintain shoulder position. Surgery is rarely required."
224,"You probably know that cigarette smoking causes breathing problems and lung cancer. But did you know it also makes you more likely to have a heart attack? Every cigarette you smoke makes you more likely to get heart disease. Roughly 1 out of 5 deaths from heart disease is directly related to smoking. People who smoke are two to four times more likely to get heart disease. The risk is even greater for women who smoke and also take birth control pills. Cigarette smoke is also bad for the people around you. Secondhand smoke can cause heart disease and lung cancer in people who don't smoke. The nicotine in smoke: Reduces how much oxygen your heart gets Raises your blood pressure Speeds up your heart rate Makes blood clots more likely, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes Harms the insides of your blood vessels, including those in your heart Soon after you stop, your odds of getting heart disease or high blood pressure will drop. After 1 to 2 years of not smoking, you'll be much less likely to get heart disease. Of course, kicking the habit also makes you less likely to get lung cancer and many other types of cancer, emphysema, and many other serious conditions. The bottom line: Odds are you'll live longer, and you'll feel better. It helps to plan ahead. Set a date to stop smoking and then stick to it. Write down your reasons for quitting smoking. Read over the list every day, before and after you quit. Keep a record of when you smoke, why you smoke, and what you're doing when you smoke. You'll learn what triggers you to smoke. You may want to first stop smoking cigarettes in certain situations, such as during your work break or after dinner, before actually quitting. Make a list of things you can do instead of smoking. Be ready to do something else when you want to smoke. Ask your doctor about medication or about using nicotine gum or patches. Some people find these aids helpful. For some, you'll need a doctor's prescription. Others are available over the counter, which means you don't need a prescription. Join a smoking cessation support group or program. Call your local chapter of the American Lung Association. Let family and friends know that you are quitting, and ask for their support. Don't carry a lighter, matches, or cigarettes. Keep all of these smoking reminders out of sight. If you live with someone who smokes, ask them not to smoke around you, or better yet, to quit with you. Don't focus on what you're missing. Think about the healthier way of life you're gaining. When you get the urge to smoke, take a deep breath. Hold it for up to 10 seconds and exhale slowly. Repeat this several times until the urge to smoke passes. Keep your hands busy. Doodle, play with a pencil or straw, or work on a computer. Change activities that were connected to smoking cigarettes. Take a walk or read a book instead of taking a cigarette break. When you can, avoid places, people, and situations associated with smoking. Hang out with people who don't smoke. Go to places that don't allow smoking, such as the movies, museums, shops, or libraries. Don't substitute food or sugar-based products for cigarette smoking. Eat low-calorie, good-for-you foods (such as carrot or celery sticks, sugar-free hard candies) or chew gum when the urge to smoke strikes so you can avoid weight gain. Drink plenty of fluids, but limit alcoholic and caffeinated beverages. They may be triggers that make you want to smoke. Exercise. It helps you burn off stress and relax. Consider starting a fitness program before you quit. Get support for quitting. Tell people about your progress. Be proud of what you're doing! Work with your doctor to make a plan using over-the-counter nicotine-replacement aids or prescription medication. It probably will be tough for a while, but it's worth it. You may crave cigarettes, be irritable, feel hungry, cough often, get headaches, or have trouble concentrating. These symptoms of withdrawal happen because your body is used to nicotine, the active addictive agent within cigarettes. You'll probably notice it most during the first 2 weeks after quitting. When it happens, remember why you're quitting. Tell yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without cigarettes. The withdrawal symptoms won't last. They're strongest when you first quit but will usually go away within 10 to 14 days. You may still want to smoke, especially with certain people or during situations where you're used to smoking. If you smoke again, start over. Most people quit three times before they're successful. Plan ahead and think about what you'll do next time you get the urge to smoke."
225,"Brain diseases come in different forms. Infections, trauma, stroke, seizures, and tumors are some of the major categories of brain diseases. Here's an overview of various diseases of the brain. Brain diseases in the category of infections include: Meningitis: An inflammation of the lining around the brain or spinal cord, usually due to infection; Neck stiffness, headache, fever, and confusion are common symptoms. Encephalitis: An inflammation of the brain tissue, usually due to a viral infection; meningitis and encephalitis often occur together, which is called meningoencephalitis. Brain abscess: A pocket of infection in the brain, usually caused by bacteria; antibiotics and surgical drainage of the area are often necessary. Included in the seizure category of brain diseases is epilepsy, a condition characterized by recurring seizures caused by abnormal and excessive electrical activity in the brain. Head injuries, brain infections, and strokes may cause epilepsy, as well. Trauma includes these conditions: Concussion: A brain injury that causes a temporary disturbance in brain function, sometimes with unconsciousness and confusion; traumatic head injuries cause concussions and may result in headache, along with concentration and memory problems. Traumatic brain injury: Acquired, often permanent brain damage from a traumatic head injury; obvious mental impairment or more subtle personality and mood changes can occur. Intracerebral hemorrhage: Any bleeding inside the brain, which may occur after a traumatic injury or stroke as a result of high blood pressure This category of brain disease includes: Brain tumor: Any abnormal tissue growth inside the brain; whether malignant (cancerous) or benign, brain tumors usually cause problems by the pressure they exert on the normal brain. Glioblastoma: An aggressive, cancerous brain tumor; glioblastomas progress rapidly and are usually difficult to cure. Hydrocephalus: An abnormally increased amount of cerebrospinal (brain) fluid inside the skull; usually, this is because the fluid is not circulating properly. Normal pressure hydrocephalus: A form of hydrocephalus that often causes problems with walking, along with dementia and urinary incontinence; pressure inside the brain remains normal, despite the increased fluid. Pseudotumor cerebri (false brain tumor): Increased pressure inside the skull with no apparent cause; vision changes, headaches, dizziness, and nausea are common symptoms. Brain diseases connected with blood vessel conditions include: Stroke: Blood flow and oxygen are suddenly interrupted to an area of brain tissue, which then may die. The body part controlled by the damaged brain area (such as an arm or a leg) may no longer function properly. Ischemic stroke: A blood clot suddenly develops in an artery or is formed elsewhere in another artery and breaks off and lodges in the brain blood vessels, blocking blood flow and causing a stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke: Bleeding in the brain creates congestion and pressure on brain tissue, impairing healthy blood flow and causing a stroke. Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA): Another name for stroke. Transient ischemic attack ( TIA): A temporary interruption of blood flow and oxygen to a part of the brain; symptoms are similar to those of a stroke, but they resolve completely (usually within 24 hours) without damage to brain tissue. Brain aneurysm: An artery in the brain develops a weak area that swells like a balloon. A brain aneurysm rupture causes a stroke, due to bleeding. Subdural hematoma: Bleeding on the surface of the brain; a subdural hematoma may exert pressure on the brain, causing neurological problems. Epidural hematoma: Bleeding between the skull and tough (dura) lining of the brain; the bleeding is typically from an artery, usually shortly after a head injury. Initial mild symptoms can progress rapidly to unconsciousness and death, if untreated. This is also referred to as an extradural hematoma. Intracerebral hemorrhage: Any bleeding inside the brain Cerebral edema: Swelling of the brain tissue which can be due to different causes, including response to injury or electrolyte imbalance Brain diseases linked to autoimmune conditions include: Vasculitis: An inflammation of the blood vessels of the brain; confusion, seizures, headaches, and unconsciousness can result. Multiple sclerosis ( MS): The immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the body's own nerves. Muscle spasm, fatigue, and weakness are symptoms. MS may occur in periodic attacks or be steadily progressive. Brain diseases linked to neurodegenerative conditions include: Parkinson's disease: Nerves in a central area of the brain degenerate slowly, causing problems with movement and coordination. Early signs are a tremor of the hands, stiffness of the limbs and trunk, slowness of movement, and unstable posture. Huntington's disease: An inherited nerve disorder that causes a degeneration of brain cells; dementia and difficulty controlling movements (chorea) are its symptoms. Early signs include mood swings, depression, and irritability. Pick's disease (frontotemporal dementia): Over years, large areas of nerves at the front and sides of the brain are destroyed, due to buildup of an abnormal protein. Personality changes, inappropriate behavior, difficulty with speech, and loss of memory and intellectual ability are symptoms. Pick's disease is steadily progressive. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS): ALS is also called Lou Gehrig's disease. In ALS, nerves controlling muscle function are steadily and rapidly destroyed. ALS steadily progresses to paralysis and inability to breathe without mechanical assistance. Cognitive function is generally not affected. Dementia: A decline in cognitive function, due to death or malfunction of nerve cells in the brain; conditions in which nerves in the brain degenerate, as well as alcohol abuse and strokes, can cause dementia. Alzheimer's disease: For unclear reasons, nerves in certain brain areas degenerate, causing progressive loss of memory and mental function, and changes in behavior and personality. The buildup of abnormal tissue in brain areas -- often called tangles and plaques -- is believed to contribute to the disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia."
226,"Don't feel bad if you get lupus and psoriatic arthritis mixed up, because they share some symptoms. If you've got pain and swelling in your joints, it could be a sign of either disease. Your doctor can set you straight, but there are some key ways to tell them apart. Lupus affects everybody differently. The way you feel may not be the same as your friend who also has the disease. Most folks will get flares, which means the condition gets worse at certain times and then gets better. The symptoms can come on slowly or suddenly, and can be permanent or temporary. Some things you may notice if you have lupus are: A rash shaped like a butterfly that covers your nose and cheeks You feel tired Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints Fever Sensitivity to sun or light that causes skin lesions White or blue color in your fingers and toes when you're in the cold or feel stressed Headaches or chest pain Ulcers in your mouth or nose Hair loss Low numbers of blood cells (anemia) Swelling in your hands, feet, or legs Like lupus, your symptoms sometimes get better and sometimes flare up. You may get tired and have pain, swelling, and warmth in your joints. If you have psoriatic arthritis you may get problems like: Severe swelling in your fingers or toes Foot pain, often at the bottom or the heel Pain in your lower back Scaly patches on your skin that flake Pitted or discolored nails It starts when your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your own organs and tissues. The disease causes inflammation and can affect different parts of your body, including your heart, skin, brain, and blood cells. Experts don't know the exact cause of lupus. They think it may be related to genes that put you at risk for lupus and things you come into contact with that trigger the disease. Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales. Sometimes people get psoriasis first and then have psoriatic arthritis later, but others get the arthritis symptoms first. Like lupus, psoriatic arthritis happens when your immune system attacks your healthy cells and tissues. This causes your joints to get inflamed and your skin to make too many cells. It's not clear what causes the immune system to attack your body when you have psoriatic arthritis, but just like lupus, it's likely that genes and triggers play a role. There's no single test that shows you have lupus. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you to get some blood and urine tests that give clues about your condition. He may also suggest you get a chest X-ray to look for fluid or inflammation in your lungs or an echocardiogram to see if you have problems with your heart. Your doctor may say you have lupus if you have at least four of 11 signs of the disease that are laid out by experts at the American College of Rheumatology: Butterfly-shaped rash Raised red patches on your skin You're sensitive to light Ulcers in your mouth or nose Arthritis in two or more joints, plus swelling or tenderness Inflammation in the lining of your heart or lungs Seizures or other nerve problems Too much protein in your urine Low blood cell counts Certain antibodies in your blood Results from a blood test called an ANA test that suggest you may have too many ""antinuclear"" antibodies, which could be a sign of lupus To check if you have psoriatic arthritis, you may need to get certain tests like X-rays to look at changes in your bones or joints, and blood tests that check for inflammation. Your doctor may also do a physical exam to see if you have inflammation and swelling in your joints or signs of psoriasis on your skin and nails. He will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor will probably rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. For example, if you only have swelling and pain in a single joint, you may have gout. And if you have no swelling, or very little, you could have osteoarthritis. Whether you have lupus or psoriatic arthritis, work with your doctor to find the right treatments for you. There are many medicines -- as well as things you can do on your own -- to get relief."
227,"Urethritis is inflammation of the urethra. That's the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. Pain with urination is the main symptom of urethritis. Urethritis is commonly due to infection by bacteria. It can typically be cured with antibiotics. Most episodes of urethritis are caused by infection by bacteria that enter the urethra from the skin around the urethra's opening. Bacteria that commonly cause urethritis include: E. coli and other bacteria present in stool Gonococcus, which is sexually transmitted and causes gonorrhea. Chlamydia trachomatis, which is sexually transmitted and causes chlamydia. The herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 and HSV-2) can also cause urethritis. Trichomonas is another cause of urethritis. It is a single-celled organism that is sexually transmitted. Sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia are usually confined to the urethra. But they may extend into women's reproductive organs, causing pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID). In men, gonorrhea and chlamydia sometimes cause epididymitis, an infection of the epididymis, a tube on the outside of the testes. Both PID and epididymitis can lead to infertility. The main symptom of urethra inflammation from urethritis is pain with urination (dysuria). In addition to pain, urethritis symptoms include: Feeling the frequent or urgent need to urinate Difficulty starting urination Urethritis can also cause itching, pain, or discomfort when a person is not urinating. Other symptoms of urethritis include: Pain during sex Discharge from the urethral opening or vagina In men, blood in the semen or urine You may get a diagnosis of urethritis when your doctor takes your medical history and asks you about your symptoms. If you are having painful urination, your doctor may assume an infection is present. He or she may treat it with antibiotics right away while waiting for test results. Tests can help confirm the diagnosis of urethritis and its cause. Tests for urethritis can include: Physical examination, including the genitals, abdomen, and rectum Urine tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or other bacteria Examination of any discharge under a microscope Blood tests are often not necessary for the diagnosis of urethritis. But blood tests may be done in certain situations. Antibiotics can successfully cure urethritis caused by bacteria. Many different antibiotics can treat urethritis. Some of the most commonly prescribed include: Adoxa, doxycycline ( Vibramycin), Monodox, Oracea Azithromycin ( Zmax), Zithromax Ceftriaxone ( Rocephin) Urethritis due to trichomonas infection (called trichomoniasis) is usually treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole ( Flagyl). Tinidazole ( Tindamax) is another antibiotic that can treat trichomoniasis. Your sexual partner should also be treated to prevent reinfection. It's important to get retested after three months to make sure the infection is completely cleared. This includes even if your partner was treated. Urethritis due to herpes simplex virus can be treated with: Acyclovir ( Zovirax) Famciclovir ( Famvir) Valacyclovir ( Valtrex) Often, the exact organism causing urethritis cannot be identified. In these situations, a doctor may prescribe one or more antibiotics that are likely to cure infection that may be present."
228,"Insomnia Insomnia is both a type of sleep disorder and can be a symptom of medical ,psychiatric and other sleep disorders. Typical patterns of insomnia include the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep at night, waking up earlier than usual, and daytime fatigue. Sleep Apnea The main symptoms of sleep apnea are loud snoring, fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness. Some people will deny sleepiness but feel fatigued. Loud snoring, snorting, and gasping sounds during sleep -- are often first noticed by a sleeping partner. Restless or unrefreshing sleep is also typical, as are headaches in the morning. Narcolepsy Excessive sleepiness during the day, temporarily alleviated by naps, can be a symptom of narcolepsy. People with narcolepsy can have âsleep attacksâ where they fall asleep suddenly and at unexpected times. Dreaming during naps and experiencing dream-like hallucinations as you fall asleep are also warning signs. Loss of muscle control (called cataplexy) that occurs with emotion, such as laughing or anger, and the inability to move as you're going to sleep or waking up (called sleep paralysis) are also symptoms. Restless Legs Syndrome The primary symptoms due to unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities. The sensations of discomfort can vary and are sometimes described as crawling, creeping, burning, itching, pulling and twitching noted deep in the legs. Symptoms occur at rest especially after sitting or lying down for extended periods of time and are worse at night. If you move your legs or get up and walk around, these symptoms may go away temporarily. It usually feels better if you get up to walk around or rub your legs. Your sleep does not improve with self-help techniques, such as establishing good sleep hygiene, cutting down on caffeine, exercising, and using relaxation techniques You think your sleep problems may be related to an underlying condition, such as depression or heart failure You snore loudly or make snorting or gasping noises while you sleep -- or your partner observes these things while you're asleep You fall asleep doing normal activities, such as talking or driving You regularly feel unrefreshed on awakening and are constantly fatigued; sleep disorders are among the many possible causes for fatigue. You suspect your medication is causing sleep problems"
229,"You've kept up with your rheumatoid arthritis treatment, and it's paid off big time. The pain and stiffness in your joints are starting to fade. So, now you begin to wonder: "" Can I cut back on my meds?"" RA is a long-term condition, and medicine keeps your symptoms under control. But some people may be able to reduce the amount of medication they take, with their doctor's advice. Studies show that people who stop their RA medicine are likely to have a flare of symptoms 4 to 8 weeks later. If your disease stays active, you're more likely to get permanent joint damage. Your doctor will want to know how long it's been since you had any problems, plus do some tests. If everything looks great, your doctor may slowly lower the dose of your medications, usually starting with any NSAID pain-reliever you take, like aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. You want to keep a constant and effective level of your RA drugs in your system, so if you are able to cut back on your medicine, it would be a slow change. It helps if you take your medicine at the same time every day. If so, tell your doctor about them. He may be able to adjust your medicine. For example, many drugs used to treat RA can cause an upset stomach. To help, your doctor may suggest that you change the time of day you take your dose, or he might tell you to take it with food. He may also recommend medication to curb your nausea and stomach acid. When you feel better and get busy, you might find that you forget to take the medications that got rid of your pain in the first place. Try some simple tips that can help keep your treatment on schedule. Use a pillbox to track which meds to take and when to take them. Pair your drugs with a daily event -- like brushing your teeth or breakfast -- so that you take them at the same time every day. Program a reminder alarm in your cell phone, computer, or digital watch, or download an app that keeps track of your medication schedule. When you renew your prescriptions, make a note on your calendar so you'll know when to get the next refill."
230,"If you're in your 60s or older, take a little time to keep your body healthy and your mind sharp. Try these easy tips that can make all the difference. As you get older, keep your thinking ability in good shape. A key part of this is to make sure your brain stays busy. Read, do crossword puzzles, socialize, try new hobbies, and start new adventures. Maybe it's finally time to learn French! At 65, you may think the heaviest thing you should lift is the remote. Not true! You do lose bone mass and flexibility with age, but regular strength training and exercise can help keep you healthy. It will help keep your muscles from shrinking, and help you avoid falls and other accidents. If you've been trying for years to kick the tobacco habit, don't give up now. You can still repair or reduce some of the damage from smoking if you quit now. For example, studies show that people who stop smoking at 65 cut their heart disease and lung cancer risks. Make sure to get your bone density screening test done when you turn 65, or sooner if you're at high risk for the bone-weakening conditions osteopenia and osteoporosis. Many experts suggest you get a mammogram every 1 to 2 years to check for breast cancer when you're 50 to 74. Check with your doctor about what you should do if you're older than 74. You may be due for another colonoscopy. It's a procedure that can find small growths called polyps that have the potential to turn into colon cancer. You should get the test every 10 years, or sooner if your doctor finds polyps. To check for cervical cancer, ask your doctor if you need regular pelvic exams with Pap and HPV tests, and how often. It's important to get a flu shot every year. Don't forget about other key vaccines, like the pneumonia shot, which you should get at 65. Also get a shingles vaccine. Even if you've had the painful condition before, it may help prevent another bout, or if you do get shingles, it will be milder."
231,"Fibromyalgia goes beyond pain. It can also affect your thinking ability, a symptom called fibro fog, and your energy level, leaving you with extreme fatigue. Even though you feel these symptoms, they aren't visible, and there aren't any tests that can measure them. You'll need to work closely with your medical team to address your specific challenges with fatigue and fibro fog, because they're a little different for everyone. Do your part by taking steps to conserve energy and overcome concentration and memory issues to power through your day. Severe fatigue -- more than just being tired -- affects up to 4 out of 5 of people with fibromyalgia. It often goes hand-in-hand with sleepless nights. Together, they leave you drained and exhausted. While scientists are learning more about what's happening in your brain that causes the pain and some other symptoms, what's behind fibro fog remains unclear. That name says it all: a fuzzy-headed feeling that keeps you from thinking clearly. You may get distracted, forget or lose things, and struggle to keep up with conversations. Over half of people with fibromyalgia say they have these kinds of problems, and many feel the fog impacts their lives more than the pain, tenderness, and fatigue. Given how you feel, you may want to shy away from exercise. But it's one of the most effective ways to handle fibromyalgia. When you're too tired to exercise, that lack of activity leads to greater muscle weakness and more fatigue. Over time, regular exercise lessens fatigue. Consistency can have a greater impact than intensity. It's possible that exercise also creates a positive chain reaction that boosts brain function. Studies show a link between physical ability and thinking ability. People who can do more physically often do better in areas like attention and decision-making. Start out at an easy pace. Work with a physical therapist to find the right beginner program for you and adapt it as you get stronger. This is especially helpful if you're nervous about exercising. Strength training helps you regain muscle, and that helps with pain and fatigue for some people. Use resistance bands or a light weight to start. Very gentle movement therapies like yoga, tai chi, and qi gong all get you moving, but yoga often has best effect on fatigue. If you're frustrated by what you can't do, try pacing yourself. Cut back on less important activities to have the energy to enjoy more meaningful ones. Break down big tasks into manageable bites. As you complete each one, you'll have a sense of accomplishment rather than feel discouraged. Build in short rest periods between tasks. Keep a journal to find the best activity/rest balance for you. Use an online calendar or app that lets you color-code activities by importance. Plan work projects and home responsibilities at least a week in advance. Then take a big-picture look. Are there too many high-priority items and not enough down time? Make adjustments, even if it means sometimes saying ""no."" Take a fibromyalgia education program to learn healthy behaviors and how to tweak everyday activities for less stress. If you work outside the home, talk to your employer about things that might help you do your job: Take breaks more often Change your work schedule Switch to a different position that better matches your abilities A psychologist or neurologist may be able to suggest more adaptations, or use biofeedback or cognitive behavior therapy to boost your focus. An occupational therapist can show you how to make physical changes, from a better workstation to stretches you can do at your desk. There's a strong connection between sleep quality and your level of fatigue. While some fibromyalgia medications may help, they may not be enough. In addition to regular exercise and pacing yourself, practice good sleep habits. These include a regular bedtime and wake-up time and a dark, cool, quiet room Some people with fibromyalgia have a second condition that causes fatigue, like an inflammatory disease, anemia, or low thyroid. Get tested and, if needed, treated. Because fibro fog and fatigue aren't obvious, it can be hard for friends and loved ones to understand what you're dealing with. Let the people in your life know that you have a disease that affects your muscles and causes pain, fatigue, and thinking problems. It might help to say researchers are pretty sure that certain areas of the brain don't process nerve signals correctly, leading to a wide range of symptoms. When you ask for help -- and it's OK to do that -- be specific about what you need."
232,"It's hard to see someone you care for in pain. It can feel good when you help ease some of it. That isn't always easy to do, so talk to a doctor about it first. You can try these ways to help relieve his aches and pains at home: Some people hold back from talking about pain. They may not want to be a burden, or they may feel that it's a sign of weakness to admit it. Encourage them that it's OK to let you know how they really feel, so you can help them take care of it. Or they may have trouble expressing it if they have dementia or have had a stroke. It's important to help treat pain, so your loved one can keep up with daily activities, stay as independent as possible, and feel better mentally and physically. Ask the person you're caring for if he is in pain. Many of the signs are obvious -- crying, moaning, clenched fists, âknittedâ eyebrows. A poor appetite may also be a clue. If the person can't tell you if they're in pain, you may need to have a doctor or therapist do an exam, including a check for bedsores. A warm shower or bath, hot water bottle, or warm cloth can help relax muscles and ease muscle spasms. A heating pad with an automatic off switch is better than a regular heating pad, which can burn skin if left on too long. Be careful with microwavable heating pads, as these can have hot spots that burn. Apply heat to the sore area for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 hours. Don't use heat on open wounds. Cold can numb pain and ease swelling. Try a cool cloth, cold pack, cold compression wrap, or ice massage. To make an ice pack, put crushed ice in a plastic bag and cover it with a towel. Don't put the bag of ice directly on your loved one's skin. Or you can use a bag of frozen peas. Ice as soon as possible after an injury. Do it for 15-20 minutes at a time, 4-8 times per day. Stop icing when the area feels numb. Slow, quiet breathing helps relax the body and mind and ease pain. You can show your loved one how to do this: Lie or sit with one hand on your belly and take a deep, slow breath. Imagine filling a balloon in your belly with air. Then breathe out, as if you're letting all the air out of the balloon. Think of breathing out stressful thoughts and breathing in relaxation. Aim for about six long, deep breaths a minute. If your loved one has lung problems, talk to his doctor about what breathing exercises would be good to try, or if other ways to relax would be better. This can be as simple as a foot, back, or hand rub. With your whole hand, the heel of your hand, or your fingertips, apply gentle pressure in slow, steady, circular movements. Warm oil or lotion may help. Massage in one area for 10 seconds first to see if it feels good. Notice if he prefers a light stroke or a firm one. It shouldn't cause pain. Ask your loved one's doctor what nonprescription pain medicines are OK to use, if needed. Acetaminophen is probably the safest for mild to moderate pain. Never use more than your doctor recommends, because it can cause liver damage and other side effects. And check to make sure the person is not taking other drugs that have acetaminophen as an ingredient. This is a common problem. There are also pain relievers that go directly on the skin, such as creams, gels, sprays, and patches. If your loved one has long-term (chronic) pain, he might need over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs, including daily, extended-release pain medications and a plan for pain flare-ups. Keep a list of all the medications (prescription or over-the-counter), supplements, and doses your loved one takes, and share that list with their doctor. This is important to do because some combinations of medicines can be harmful, particularly for elderly people. Their doctor can check on safety and make changes if needed. This small machine uses a mild electrical current to ease pain. It has electrodes that go on your skin and deliver a low-level electrical charge, which can lower pain signals and may help relax muscles and stimulate your body's natural painkillers, called endorphins. You may get TENS (which is short for âtranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulationâ) at home or in a doctor's or physical therapist's office."
233,"Pectin is a soluble fiber found in most plants. It is most abundant in: Apples Plums The peel and pulp of citrus fruits In food, it is most commonly used to thicken jams, jellies, and preserves. The human body cannot digest pectin in its natural form. But an altered form of pectin, known as modified citrus pectin ( MCP), has properties that allow it to be digested. People take MCP for a variety of reasons. Some research suggests that pectin, like other soluble fibers such as those found in oatmeal and in psyllium husks, can help lower LDL ""bad"" cholesterol. But the effect is a small one. If you have high cholesterol, soluble fibers such as pectin may help to lower it, but they usually can't do the job on their own. Much of the information we know about pectin is based on animal studies. Pectin has also been used to control diarrhea, and some evidence points to its effectiveness for treating very young children. The FDA, though, decided in 2003 that the available evidence does not support such a use. The following year it banned the use of pectin in over-the-counter diarrhea medications. Pectin may have a potential role in cancer care. In a small study of men with prostate cancer for whom standard treatment had failed, MCP appeared to slow the growth of their cancer. Larger, better designed studies are needed before any conclusions are drawn about MCP's potential as an anticancer agent. Pectin has also been used to try to treat heavy metal toxicity, which can result from exposure to lead, mercury, arsenic, and other elements. Some people believe that MCP can help the body excrete such poisonous substances. But little unbiased research exists to support such claims. Optimal doses for MCP have not been established for any condition, though 3-15 grams divided throughout the day have been used. Also, as with supplements generally, the quality of the active ingredients in products that contain MCP varies from maker to maker. Many common fruits have pectin, so a healthy diet will include pectin. However, naturally occurring pectin must be modified in order for it to be digestible. Such pectin is then most often sold in powder and capsule form. Few side effects are associated with taking MCP. But that does not mean it is risk-free. Some people have reported mild stomach cramps and diarrhea while taking MCP. People who are allergic to citrus fruits should avoid MCP. Also, MCP may interfere with certain cancer treatments and should not be taken without supervision. Pectin can reduce the body's ability to absorb beta-carotene, an important nutrient. And pectin can also interfere with the body's ability to absorb certain drugs, including: Digoxin (a heart medicine) Lovastatin (a cholesterol-lowering drug) Tetracycline antibiotics The FDA does not regulate supplements such as pectin. Talk to your doctor about potential risks before you take pectin or any other dietary supplement."
234,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects a person's thinking, emotions, relationships, and decision making. And because there's no cure, getting the proper treatment early is the best way to improve chances of managing the illness. Schizophrenia treatment will center on managing the person's symptoms. To do that, they'll probably need to take medication for an open-ended period of time, possibly even for life. Psychotherapy, a kind of talk therapy, will likely also be a big part of the plan to help them understand and manage their symptoms. There's more than one kind of psychotherapy and many types of medications, so you'll want to know what's involved. Individual psychotherapy . During sessions, a therapist or psychiatrist can teach the person how to deal with their thoughts and behaviors. They'll learn more about their illness and its effects, as well as how to tell the difference between what's real and what's not. It also can help them manage everyday life. Cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT). This can help the person change their thinking and behavior. A therapist will show them ways to deal with voices and hallucinations. With a combination of CBT sessions and medication, they can eventually tell what triggers their psychotic episodes (times when hallucinations or delusions flare up) and how to reduce or stop them. Cognitive enhancement therapy ( CET). This type of therapy is also called cognitive remediation. It teaches people how to better recognize social cues, or triggers, and improve their attention, memory, and ability to organize their thoughts. It combines computer-based brain training and group sessions. If a person with schizophrenia sees improvement during psychotherapy sessions, it's likely they'll need more help learning how to become part of a community. That's where psychosocial therapy comes in. Social skills training. This type of instruction focuses on improving communication and social interactions. Rehabilitation. Schizophrenia usually develops during the years we are building our careers. So rehabilitation may include job counseling, problem-solving support, and education in money management. Family education. Your knowledge of psychosis and schizophrenia can help a friend or family member who has it. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who have a strong support system do better than those without the encouragement of friends and family. Self-help groups. You should encourage your loved one to participate in community care and outreach programs to continue working on his social skills. The National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI) is an outreach organization that offers a free peer-to-peer program, for instance. It includes 10 sessions for adults with mental illness who want to learn more about their condition from people who have experienced it themselves or been through it with a loved one. Coordinated specialty care ( CSC). This is for people experiencing an episode of psychosis for the first time. It's a team approach that combines medication and psychological therapies. It includes social and employment services and tries to include the family whenever possible. The aim is to change the direction and prognosis for the disease by catching it in its earliest stages. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who get early and intensive treatment have the best long-term results. Assertive community treatment ( ACT). This offers highly personalized services to help people with schizophrenia meet life's daily challenges, like taking medications. ACT professionals also help them handle problems proactively and work to prevent crises. Social recovery therapy. This treatment puts the focus on helping the person set and achieve goals and building a sense of optimism and positive beliefs about themselves and others. These newer medications are less likely to cause certain side effects than the first-generation antipsychotics. But many medications in this family can cause weight gain and raise blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Changes in nutrition and exercise, and possibly medication intervention, can help address these side effects. They include: Aripiprazole ( Abilify) Asenapine ( Saphris) Brexpiprazole ( Rexulti) Cariprazine ( Vraylar) Clozapine ( Clozaril) Iloperidone ( Fanapt) Lurasidone ( Latuda) Olanzapine ( Zyprexa) Paliperidone ( Invega) Pimavanserin ( Nuplazid) Quetiapine ( Seroquel) Risperidone ( Risperdal) Ziprasidone ( Geodon) You might hear these drugs called typical or conventional. These medications block a brain chemical called dopamine and are more likely than second-generation antipsychotics to cause significant movement disorders like intense muscle stiffness (called dystonia) or a condition that may develop over long-term exposure called tardive dyskinesia. Drugs in this group include: Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine) Fluphenazine ( Proxlixin) Haloperidol ( Haldol) Loxapine ( Loxitane) Perphenazine ( Trilafon) Pimozide ( Orap) Thioridazine ( Mellaril) Thiothixene ( Navane) Trifluoperazine ( Stelazine) In this procedure, electrodes are attached to the person's scalp. While they're under general anesthesia, doctors send a small electric shock to the brain. A course of ECT therapy usually involves 2-3 treatments per week for several weeks. Each shock treatment causes a controlled seizure. A series of treatments over time leads to improvement in mood and thinking. Scientists don't fully understand exactly how ECT and the controlled seizures it causes help, although some researchers think that ECT-induced seizures may affect the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. It can help when medications no longer work or if severe depression or catatonia makes treating the illness difficult."
235,"If you watch over a young child, you probably know how common earaches can be. Adults get them, too, but kids usually get them more often because they haven't built up their immune systems to fight off common viruses and bacteria yet. You can't always stop all ear infections. But you can learn what causes them and then take steps to lower the chances that you or a child in your care will get them. You get these infections in your middle ear. It's an air-filled space behind your eardrum. It holds tiny, vibrating bones that pick up sound waves so you can hear. A cold, the flu, or even allergies can all bring one on, too. That's because they tend to cause congestion and swelling in your nasal passages and throat. When fluid builds up and doesn't drain effectively, it can increase your chance of an ear infection. Ear infections tend to occur more in fall and winter because upper-respiratory infections such as cold and flu are on the rise then, too. Children who are 2 and younger get more ear infections because of the small size and shape of their Eustachian tubes. Other things that can come into play: Bottles and pacifiers: If children drink from a bottle while lying down or use a pacifier, then they're more likely to get ear infections. Daycare centers: Children can be exposed to more germs in situations where there are a lot of kids. Air quality: Cigarette smoke and other kinds of air pollution can increase your child's chances of getting an ear infection. These things can help reduce the number of infections your child may get: Breastfeeding: Babies who nurse for 12 months or more tend to have fewer infections. If breastfeeding isn't an option, bottle feed your child in an upright, sitting position. Fresh air: Don't expose your baby to cigarette smoke. Try to avoid other forms of air pollution, too, when you can. Immunizations: Keep up to date on your child's shots. Toss the pacifiers: If your baby is using a pacifier after 12 months old, the chance for ear infections increases. Do your best to wean your little one off them. Wash: Clean your child's hands and your own often with soap and water. This can reduce the spread of germs and prevent your child from catching the flu or a cold. Another tip, even though it can be very hard: Try to keep dirty objects away from your child's mouth. Make that call if any of these things are happening with your child: Fever: Keep a watchful eye for high temperatures. Take action if: Your child is younger than 3 months and shows a fever of 100.4 F or more It's above 104 F for any child at any time A fever lasts more than a day in a toddler younger than 2 It lasts more than 3 days in kids 2 and older Strong pain: Your child is really hurting and pain medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen are not helping. Discharge: Pus or blood is leaking from your child's ear. You are not as likely to get an ear infection as a child. That's because a grown-up's Eustachian tubes are larger. And the shape of an adult's tube means it's less likely to get clogged. If you have pain or fluids coming out of your ear, you need to see a doctor as soon as possible."
236,"Influenza, commonly called ""the flu,"" is caused by viruses that infect the respiratory tract. Compared with most other respiratory infections, such as the common cold, the flu often causes a more severe illness. Typical flu symptoms include fever (usually 100-103 degrees Fahrenheit in adults and often even higher in children) and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches, and often extreme fatigue. Although nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can sometimes accompany the flu, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rare. The term ""stomach flu"" isn't really a flu at all. It's often used to describe an illness caused by other viruses. Most people who get the flu recover completely in one to two weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. Because each flu season is different in length and severity, the number of serious illnesses and deaths that occur each year varies. In the past 30 years, the annual death rate from flu-related causes has ranged from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths per year. Flu-related complications can occur at any age; however, very young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications of the flu than are younger, healthier people. Flu viruses are divided into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates for hospitalization and death. Influenza type C differs from types A and B in some important ways. Type C infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact that influenza types A and B do. Efforts to control the impact of the flu are aimed at types A and B, and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types. Flu viruses continually change over time. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the immune system, so that people are susceptible to the flu throughout life. This process works as follows: a person infected with a flu virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes, the ""older"" antibodies no longer recognizes the ""newer"" virus, and the person gets sick. The older antibodies can, however, provide partial protection against newer viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continually undergo a type of change called antigenic drift. This process accounts for most of the changes that occur in the viruses from one influenza season to another. Another change -- called antigenic shift -- occurs only occasionally. When it does occur, large numbers of people, and sometimes the entire population, have no antibody protection against the virus. This may result in a worldwide epidemic, called a pandemic. During the last century, major pandemics occurred three times, each of which resulted in large numbers of deaths: 1918-19 "" Spanish flu"" A -- Caused the highest known influenza-related mortality: approximately 500,000 deaths occurred in the U. S., 20 million worldwide 1957-58 "" Asian flu"" A -- 70,000 deaths in the United States 1968-69 "" Hong- Kong flu"" A -- 34,000 deaths in the United States"
237," Vitiligo is a condition in which white patches develop on the skin. Any location on the body can be affected, and most people with vitiligo have white patches on many areas. The skin doesn't have its characteristic color because it has lost its melanin. For some reason, the pigment-forming cells known as melanocytes have been destroyed. We don't know exactly why this happens. It might be an autoimmune condition, where your body's defenses turn on your own cells instead of attacking invading germs. Although vitiligo affects all races equally, it's more noticeable in dark-skinned people. Up to 2% of the population and an estimated 2 to 5 million Americans have the condition. It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. In most cases, it develops early in life, between ages 10 and 30. It will almost always show up before age 40. Vitiligo may run in families. You're more likely to get it when someone else in your family has it, too, or when people in your family get gray hair prematurely. Autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease ( Hashimoto's thyroiditis) or type 1 diabetes, can also raise your odds. You'll often lose pigment quickly on several areas of your skin. After the white patches appear, they may stay the same for a while, but later on, they might get bigger. You may have cycles of pigment loss and stability. Vitiligo commonly affects body folds (such as armpits), places that have been injured in the past, and areas exposed to sun, around moles, or around body openings. It can also affect eyelids and hair. It's rare for pigment to return once the white patches have developed. Your doctor can usually make a diagnosis of vitiligo by looking at your skin during a physical exam. There's no known way to prevent or cure the condition. But you can improve the appearance of affected skin with cosmetics and corticosteroid creams. Your doctor can also try re-pigmenting the white skin using UV light therapy or lightening the skin in unaffected areas, or a skin graft."
238,"Crohn's disease is a chronic illness in which the intestine, bowel, or another part of the digestive tract become inflamed and ulcerated. Ulcerated means it is marked with sores. Along with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is part of a group of diseases known as inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. Crohn's disease most commonly affects the lower part of the small intestine. That part is called the ileum. The disease can, though, occur in any part of the large or small intestine, stomach, esophagus, or even the mouth. It can occur at any age, but it is most common between ages 15 and 30. People with Crohn's disease experience periods of severe symptoms. These are followed by periods with no symptoms that can last for weeks or years. The period with no symptoms is called remission. Unfortunately, there is no way to know when a remission will occur or when symptoms will return. The symptoms of Crohn's disease depend on where the disease is in the bowel. They also depend on its severity. In general, symptoms can include: chronic diarrhea rectal bleeding weight loss fever abdominal pain and tenderness (often on the right side of the lower abdomen) feeling of a mass or fullness in the lower, right abdomen delayed development and stunted growth (in children) If you have active Crohn's disease you may have a more difficult time getting pregnant than you would when it's in remission. Ideally, you should be in good health and in remission when you conceive. If a man who wants to become a father is taking sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) for Crohn's disease, he should ask his doctor to change his medication. Sulfasalazine can cause a lower sperm count. The drug methotrexate is deadly to fetuses and newborn babies. If a man is taking methotrexate for Crohn's disease, he should stop taking it for three months before attempting conception. Women with Crohn's disease should avoid methotrexate before getting pregnant and while pregnant. If you are taking methotrexate after giving birth, you should not breastfeed. If both parents have IBD, the child has about a one in three chance of having IBD. If only one parent has Crohn's disease, the chance of the baby getting the condition is about 9%. Crohn's disease seems to affect children more severely than adults. A child with Crohn's disease may have slower growth and delayed sexual development. For some people, pregnancy has a positive effect on Crohn's disease. Pregnancy can lessen the symptoms. This is probably because pregnancy itself causes a suppression of the immune system. That happens so the body won't reject the fetus. Being pregnant may protect you against future flare-ups of Crohn's disease. It's also possible it may reduce the need for surgery in the future. This is because pregnant women produce the hormone relaxin. Relaxin stops premature contractions of the uterus. It is thought that relaxin might inhibit the formation of scar tissue. Women who have IBD have normal pregnancies and deliveries at the same rate as women without IBD. It is mainly when you have active Crohn's disease that problems can occur. Active Crohn's disease raises the risk of miscarriage. It also creates a higher risk of premature delivery and stillbirth. Women with inactive Crohn's disease, though, also have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage as compared with pregnant women. With or without Crohn's disease, you need to discuss all your medications with your doctor when you are pregnant. In general, medication for Crohn's disease does not change during pregnancy. It might, though, if you have a change in your condition. As for specific types of drugs to treat Crohn's disease, only antibiotics and methotrexate must be avoided. That's because of the harm they can do to the fetus. Drugs that affect the immune system are called immunomodulators and immunosuppressives. These drugs do not seem to cause problems during pregnancy when they are used in standard dosages. The exception is methotrexate. Methotrexate should not be taken if you are pregnant. Nor should it be taken by either a man or a woman who is trying to conceive. Methotrexate can cause the death of the fetus. It can also cause congenital abnormalities. If you are taking methotrexate, you also should not breastfeed. Drugs in the aminosalicylate class (5- ASA drugs) do not damage the fetus or increase the risk of complications. These drugs include: balsalazide ( Colazal) mesalamine ( Apriso, Asacol, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa) olsalazine ( Dipentum) sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) In addition, if you are taking a 5- ASA drug, you will be able to breastfeed safely. If you are on steroids, you should not get pregnant. If you are taking a corticosteroid such as prednisone or another steroid and do get pregnant, your doctor will prescribe the smallest possible dose. If you are breastfeeding while taking steroids in moderate to high doses, your baby should be monitored by a pediatrician. Biologic drugs such as adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, infliximab ( Remicade), and infliximab-abda ( Renflexis) and infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), biosimilars to Remicade, seem to be safe for use during pregnancy. They also do not appear to be secreted in breast milk. If you are taking vitamins before becoming pregnant, you can continue taking them. If you are taking sulfasalazine, you need to be particularly sure you get enough folic acid. Folic acid prevents neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. Sulfasalazine blocks the absorption of folic acid. When you are pregnant and have Crohn's disease, you may safely undergo any of the following if they're needed: colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy upper endoscopy rectal biopsy abdominal ultrasound X-rays and CT (computed tomography) scans, though, should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans appear to be safe during pregnancy. Women who have had bowel resections (surgeries to remove part of the bowel) do not appear to have any problems during pregnancy. Women who have had ileostomies may have lower fertility rates. An ileostomy is a procedure in which the end of the small intestine is brought through a hole in the abdomen called a stoma. It's done so that waste may be emptied into a bag attached to the stoma. It may be best to wait for a year after this surgery to become pregnant in order to reduce the risk of the ileostomy dropping or becoming blocked during pregnancy. Some women with Crohn's disease develop fistulas -- abnormal passageways between organs. If you have a fistula or an abscess -- a cavity filled with pus -- that's near the rectum and vaginal area you will likely be advised to deliver your baby by cesarean section, or C-section."
239,"Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and substances they produce protect us from infection with foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses.  However, in some diseases, like arthritis, the body's defense system -- the immune system -- triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign invaders to fight off. In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal. Some, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in the joints. Some types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following: Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Gouty arthritis Other painful conditions of the joints and musculoskeletal system that may not be associated with inflammation include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, muscular low back pain, and muscular neck pain. Symptoms of inflammation include: Redness Swollen joint that's sometimes warm to the touch Joint pain Joint stiffness Loss of joint function Often, only a few of these symptoms are present. Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining and, eventually, wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones). Inflammatory diseases are diagnosed after careful evaluation of the following: Complete medical history and physical exam with attention to: The pattern of painful joints and whether there is evidence of inflammation Presence of joint stiffness in the morning Evaluation of other symptoms Results of X-rays and blood tests Yes. Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure. Pain may not be a primary symptom of an inflammatory disease, since many organs do not have many pain-sensitive nerves. Treatment of organ inflammation is directed at the cause of inflammation whenever possible. There are a number of treatment options for inflammatory diseases, like arthritis, including medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms. The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. However, when ""chemotherapy"" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment. When you are prescribed any medication, it is important to meet with your doctor regularly so he or she can detect the development of any side effects."
240,"You probably get some signs that your period is coming. For most women, it's no big deal -- maybe tender breasts or a taste for sweets. But for others, the days before their period are harder. If it messes with your daily life, you might have premenstrual syndrome ( PMS). Your period is a natural part of your life. And you can do anything you would do any other time of the month. If PMS is a problem for you, there are ways to manage it. PMS is a group of changes that can affect you on many levels. They can be physical, emotional, or behavioral. The changes come 1 to 2 weeks before your period. Once your period starts, they go away. Most women have at least one sign of PMS each month. But it's not the same for everyone. It can change as you get older. It can be hard to know if you just have a few symptoms before your period, or if it's really PMS. One way to think about it is to ask the question: â Do these changes get in the way of my regular life? Do they cause trouble at work or with family and friends?â If you answer yes, it might be PMS. Another way to know is if you have symptoms on the 5 days before your period, for 3 months in a row. Women with PMS deal with it in lots of ways. You can make changes to improve your diet, sleep, and exercise. You can also learn ways to relax their mind and body. If what you try doesn't seem to work, you could talk to your doctor. PMS shows up in many different ways. Everything in this list could be a sign of PMS. But most women get just a few of these, not all of them. Physical signs Bloated tummy Cramps Tender breasts Hunger Headache Muscle aches Joint pain Swollen hands and feet Pimples Weight gain Constipation or diarrhea Emotional signs Tense or anxious Depressed Crying Mood swings Can't sleep Don't want to be with people Feel overwhelmed or out of control Angry outbursts Behavioral signs Forget things Loss of mental focus Tired Girls and women who still get their period can get PMS. But it's most common in women who: Are in their late 20s to early 40s. Have had a child. Have family members with depression. Had baby blues (postpartum depression), depression or bipolar disorder. Even though PMS is common, doctors don't know exactly what causes it. It probably has to do with changes in your body chemistry around the time of your period. Some conditions affect PMS, but don't cause it. PMS can be brought on, or can get worse if you: Smoke Are under lots of stress Don't exercise Don't sleep enough Drink too much alcohol or eat too much salt, red meat, or sugar Are depressed Women with other health problems may find that those problems get worse before their period. Some of those are migraine headaches, asthma, and allergies. There are lots of ways to manage PMS. Even if you can't totally fix it, it's nice to know you have the power to help yourself. These ideas might help: Exercise about 30 minutes a day. Eat healthy foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Try to get enough calcium from foods (think dairy, green leafy vegetables, and canned salmon). Avoid salt, caffeine, and alcohol. Don't smoke. Get plenty of sleep. Work to lower stress. Track your moods and symptoms in a journal. Try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions exactly as it says on the label. Some women take vitamins and minerals like folic acid, magnesium, vitamin B-6, vitamin E, and calcium with vitamin D. Others find that herbal remedies help. If you take any vitamins or supplements, check with your doctor first to make sure it's safe for you. If you've tried different things, but still have bad PMS, it's probably time to get help. Make an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. She'll ask about your symptoms, your health, and medicines you take. She may take some blood tests to make sure the problem is PMS and not something else. Your doctor may prescribe medicine. Birth control pills sometimes help with headache and cramps. Antidepressants (medicines that help treat depression) may be an option. Some women take medicine to get rid of extra fluid that makes them feel bloated. Doctors call these diuretics (water pills). Your doctor might suggest talk therapy. It's a way to feel better and learn new skills to overcome challenges by talking with a mental health counselor. If you have notes about your symptoms, bring it to the appointment. Plan ahead about the questions you want to ask. That way you'll get the best help from your doctor."
241,"A blister is a bubble of skin filled with clear fluid, ranging from pinpoint size to more than an inch in diameter. They are different than pustules, which contain thicker, yellow-white material called pus. Depending on the cause, blistering may be accompanied by pain, redness, or itching. The blister was caused by contact with a chemical -- or if you have an autoimmune blistering disease. Other reasons to seek medical advice is if you have multiple blisters, or they progress in number and location, or if you can't figure out why you are getting them."
242,"Decades ago, the only baby bottles available to parents were made of glass. But glass was heavy and breakable. So when plastic bottles came along that were lighter and shatter-proof, the glass bottle became almost obsolete. However, recent reports that a type of plastic found in baby bottles might cause potentially harmful changes in developing babies has left parents wondering if perhaps old-fashioned glass wasn't such a bad thing after all. Which is safer, glass or plastic? Here is some background on baby bottles, along with tips on how to choose -- and use -- bottles safely and effectively. The problem with glass bottles is pretty obvious -- drop one on the floor in the middle of a late-night feeding, and you'll have a roomful of shattered glass to clean up. Glass is also heavy and cumbersome. On the upside, glass bottles are sturdy, and they don't contain any chemicals that could potentially get into the baby's formula. Plastic baby bottles are lightweight, strong, and unbreakable. In 2012, the FDA banned the use of bisphenol A in the manufacture of baby bottles and sippy cups. There were concerns that the chemical in polycarbonate plastic could lead to certain cancers, changes in the brain and reproductive system, and early puberty. All baby bottles and sippy cups sold in the USA are now BPA-free. In 2013, the FDA supported a food additive amendment to end the use of bisphenol A-based epoxy resins in the lining of formula cans. Manufacturers had abandoned the use of BPA in those products, so the move was largely supportive. There are essentially three types of baby bottles: plastic, plastic with disposable liners, and glass. The ban on BPA means you can confidently buy new plastic baby bottles, knowing that they are free of the potentially harmful chemical. If you are using older plastic bottles, for example bottles given to you by family members, check the recycling symbol on the bottom. The symbol #7 or the label PC (which stands for polycarbonate) is a sign that the bottle likely contains BPA. Bottles with the symbol #1, #2, or #4 are made of polyethylene, and #5 bottles are made of polypropylene. Both kinds of bottle can be used safely since neither type contains BPA. Disposable bottle liners are also typically BPA-free (look for the words "" BPA-free"" on the label). They tend to be more expensive than bottles alone, though, because you have to change them after each feeding. If you want to try glass bottles but you're concerned about them breaking, some companies make silicone sleeves that go over the bottle to protect it. Here are some tips on caring for your child's baby bottle: Never store breast milk or formula in plastic bottles. Pour it into the bottle just before your baby is ready to eat. Throw out anything that is left over. Don't use hot water or a harsh cleaner on polycarbonate bottles, because this also can cause the plastic to break down more quickly. Instead, use a gentle cleaner and warm water. Replace any glass bottles that have cracks or chips in them."
243,"Do you hear ringing in your ears when there isn't any sound around you? That's tinnitus. Although it's called ringing, the noise can be lots of things, from a buzz or roar to a hiss, click, or even a pulse like your heartbeat. You might hear the noise in one ear or both ears. You might hear it all the time or it might come and go. Tinnitus isn't a disease. It's a symptom of another health problem. It often happens when tiny hairs in your inner ear that help with hearing are hurt in some way. That affects the signals that go to your brain and changes how you hear sound. This damage can be caused by normal aging or many other issues. Triggers may include: Age-related hearing loss Loud noises like concerts, sporting events, machinery, or backfiring engines Sinus pressure from sinus or ear infections, cold, flu, or allergies Too much earwax Certain medications like aspirin, some antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Migraines and other headaches High blood pressure and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Jaw problems Other medical issues like head and neck injuries, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, changes in your inner ear bones, and an inner ear disorder called Meniere's disease. Your doctor will discuss your medical history. He'll ask about any medicines you take, including supplements. He'll do a hearing test, examine your head and neck, and look inside your ears. He might ask you to clench your jaw, move your eyes, and move your neck, arms, and legs. If the ringing gets worse when you move, that may help find a cause for it. You may also need imaging tests like CT or MRI scans. Your doctor may not be able to find the cause. If that happens, he'll work with you to find ways to lessen the sound or help you manage it better. Yes. It depends on what's to blame for the ringing. If a medication is the trigger, your doctor might suggest you stop taking it or change to a different drug. Never stop a medicine on your own without talking to your doctor first. If a health issue like high blood pressure is the cause, your doctor can work with you to treat it. Often the ringing will improve when you get the condition under control. If the problem is too much earwax, the doctor can remove the buildup gently. Don't use cotton swabs to try to do it yourself. Other treatment options may include: Hearing aids. These devices can help with age-related hearing loss and tinnitus. They make the sounds you need to hear louder and make the ringing harder to notice. Sound maskers. You wear them in or behind your ear to create constant low-level white noise. This helps block the ringing. You might also try a white noise machine near your bed at night to help you sleep. Retraining therapy. You get counseling and wear a gadget that masks the ringing with tonal music. Relaxation techniques. Tinnitus can get worse when you're stressed. You might find ways to ease your worries, like exercise, deep breathing, or biofeedback. Medicines. There are several medications that show some promise in treating tinnitus, including certain hormones, topical anesthetics, and anti-anxiety medication. Ask your doctor if any of them may be right for you."
244,"Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a mental illness that brings severe high and low moods and changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior. People who have bipolar disorder can have periods in which they feel overly happy and energized and other periods of feeling very sad, hopeless, and sluggish. In between those periods, they usually feel normal. You can think of the highs and the lows as two ""poles"" of mood, which is why it's called ""bipolar"" disorder. The word ""manic"" describes the times when someone with bipolar disorder feels overly excited and confident. These feelings can also involve irritability and impulsive or reckless decision-making. About half of people during mania can also have delusions (believing things that aren't true and that they can't be talked out of) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). "" Hypomania"" describes milder symptoms of mania, in which someone does not have delusions or hallucinations, and their high symptoms do not interfere with their everyday life. The word ""depressive"" describes the times when the person feels very sad or depressed. Those symptoms are the same as those described in major depressive disorder or ""clinical depression,"" a condition in which someone never has manic or hypomanic episodes. Most people with bipolar disorder spend more time with depressive symptoms than manic or hypomanic symptoms. In bipolar disorder, the dramatic episodes of high and low moods do not follow a set pattern. Someone may feel the same mood state (depressed or manic) several times before switching to the opposite mood. These episodes can happen over a period of weeks, months, and sometimes even years. How severe it gets differs from person to person and can also change over time, becoming more or less severe. Symptoms of mania (""the highs""): Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile Restlessness Rapid speech and poor concentration Increased energy and less need for sleep Unusually high sex drive Making grand and unrealistic plans Showing poor judgment Drug and alcohol abuse Becoming more impulsive During depressive periods (""the lows""), a person with bipolar disorder may have: Sadness Loss of energy Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not enjoying things they once liked Trouble concentrating Uncontrollable crying Trouble making decisions Irritability Needing more sleep Insomnia Appetite changes that make them lose or gain weight Thoughts of death or suicide Attempting suicide When someone develops bipolar disorder, it usually starts when they're in late adolescence or young adulthood. Rarely, it can happen earlier in childhood. Bipolar disorder can run in families. Men and women are equally likely to get it. Women are somewhat more likely than men to go through ""rapid cycling,"" which is having four or more distinct mood episodes within a year. Women also tend to spend more time depressed than men with bipolar disorder. Many people with the condition abuse alcohol or other drugs when manic or depressed. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to have seasonal depression, co-existing anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is no single cause. Genes, brain changes, and stress can all play a role. Researchers are studying how these factors may contribute to the development of bipolar disorder. If you or someone you know has symptoms of bipolar disorder, talk to your family doctor or a psychiatrist. They will ask questions about mental illnesses that you, or the person you're concerned about, have had, and any mental illnesses that run in the family. The person will also get a complete psychiatric evaluation to tell if they have likely bipolar disorder or another mental health condition."" Diagnosing bipolar disorder is all about the person's symptoms and determining whether they may be the result of another cause (such as low thyroid, or mood symptoms caused by drug or alcohol abuse). How severe are they? How long have they lasted? How often do they happen? The most telling symptoms are those that involve highs or lows in mood, along with changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior. Talking to close friends and family of the person can often help the doctor distinguish bipolar disorder from major depressive (unipolar) disorder or other psychiatric disorders that can involve changes in mood, thinking, and behavior. Bipolar disorder can be treated. It's a long-term condition that needs ongoing care. Medication is the main treatment, usually involving ""mood stabilizers"" such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal), lithium, or valproate ( Depakote). Sometimes antipsychotic drugs are also used such as olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), lurasidone ( Latuda) and cariprazine ( Vraylar)), as well as antidepressants. Combinations of medicines are often used. Psychotherapy, or ""talk therapy,"" is often recommended, too. People who have four or more mood episodes in a year, or who also have drug or alcohol problems, can have forms of the illness that are much harder to treat. For most people, a good treatment program can stabilize moods and provide symptom relief. Ongoing treatment is more effective than dealing with problems as they come up. People who also have a substance abuse problem may need more specialized treatment. Some people who have bipolar disorder may become suicidal. Learn the warning signs and seek immediate medical help for them: Depression (changes in eating, sleeping, activities) Isolating yourself Talking about suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Acting recklessly Taking more risks Having more accidents Abusing alcohol or other drugs Focusing on morbid and negative themes Talking about death and dying Crying more, or becoming less emotionally expressive Giving away possessions"
245,"Electroconvulsive therapy, also known as ECT or electroshock therapy, is a short-term treatment for severe manic or depressive episodes, particularly when symptoms involve serious suicidal or psychotic symptoms, or when medicines seem to be ineffective. It can be effective in nearly 75% of patients. In electroconvulsive therapy, an electric current is passed through the scalp to cause a brief seizure in the brain. ECT is one of the fastest ways to relieve symptoms in people who suffer from mania or severe depression. ECT is generally used only when medicines or other less invasive treatments prove to be unhelpful. It is also used when mood or psychotic symptoms are so severe that it may be unsafe to wait until drugs can take effect. ECT is also often thought to be the treatment of choice for severe mood episodes during pregnancy. Prior to ECT treatment, a person is given a muscle relaxant and put under general anesthesia. Electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp, and an electric current is applied that causes a brief seizure. Because the muscles are relaxed, the seizure will usually be limited to slight movement of the hands and feet. The patient is carefully monitored during the treatment. The patient awakens minutes later, does not remember the treatment or events surrounding the treatment, and may be briefly confused. ECT is usually given up to three times a week, typically for two to four weeks. After that, maintenance treatment can continue weekly or monthly, depending on the person's needs. ECT is among the safest treatments for severe mood disorders, with most risks being related to the anesthesia. Short-term memory loss is a common side effect, although this usually goes away within a few weeks after the treatments have ended, and can be minimized based on how the electrodes are placed on the scalp and other technical aspects of how the procedure is done. Other possible side effects of ECT include: Confusion Nausea Headache Jaw pain Muscle aches These side effects may last from several hours to several days. About a third of people who have ECT report some memory loss, but this is usually limited to the time surrounding the treatment."
246,"Cute colors and adorable prints may be what draws you to a rack of baby clothes. To make your final selection, though, you need to consider safety, comfort, and practicality -- easy to put on and washable. And you probably want to consider the price, too. It's OK to shop in secondhand stores or high-quality consignment shops for most things for babies. Just be sure to wash everything first. Safety first: no buttons, bows, or ties. Stay away from clothes with small buttons, decorative rhinestones, or bows, because they can be choking risks. Clothes with long ties or that pull tightly around your baby's arms, legs, or neck are also unsafe. Make sure decorations are sewed on tight. Pick fire-safe sleepwear. Labels on your baby's sleepwear will tell you whether it needs to be worn snugly to be fire-retardant or if the fabric itself is flame-retardant. But be aware: Scientists haven't closely studied the long-term health effects of the chemicals that make fabrics fire-resistant. Some research has linked some of these chemicals to health problems, including delayed physical and mental development, thyroid trouble, and problems with mental activities like thinking and memory. If the chemicals aren't well-bound to the fabric, they can get inside your baby's body more easily. If you worry about this risk, you can always choose all-natural fabrics that are flame-retardant when they fit snuggly. If you choose flame-resistant fabrics, follow the laundry instructions to keep the retardant from washing away. This is one place where secondhand items may not be a good choice -- if they've been washed incorrectly they're no longer effective. Shop by your baby's weight, not age. Age doesn't mean much when it comes to baby clothes. Different brands size clothing differently. Weight is a better measure, and many baby clothes list it along with age on their labels. How easily can you get them on and off? Dressing a wiggling newborn can be a bit of a struggle. Follow these tips when you're shopping for clothes to make it easier. Wide necks or snaps at the neck make dressing easier. ( If you pick clothes that pull over the head, do it quickly because babies panic when their breathing is blocked or when they can't see you.) Snaps and zippers in the front are easier to put on and take off than those on the back. Loose sleeves pull on and off easier than tight ones. Snaps or other easy openings at the crotch make it quicker and easier to change diapers -- you don't have to take off all of your baby's clothes. Choose washable. Buy clothes that say ""machine washable"" on the label to avoid the time and energy of hand-washing or ironing. Clothes made from 100% cotton are ideal, since they're comfortable, durable, and they wash well. Think ahead -- wisely. Some babies never fit into the ""newborn"" size. Others may even grow out of 3-month-sized clothes after only 1 month. So buy items in the 6-month or 1-year size to have on hand. It's fine if some clothes are a little big. Your baby will grow into them. It's not a great idea, though, to buy seasonal clothes, like swimsuits or winter coats, well in advance. It's impossible to predict your baby's size."
247,"Finding out that cancer has spread is never welcome news, but don't assume it's the worst news. The 5-year survival rate for prostate cancer that has moved into nearby parts of the body is nearly 100%. Here's what you should know about your treatment and what to expect going forward. When this type of cancer spreads (your doctor may say it has metastasized), it tends to first show up in the tissues or lymph nodes that are closest to the prostate gland. If it's caught and treated in this point, which is known as ""regional"" stage, your odds or recovery are very good. If it travels further, the cancer usually ends up in your bones. At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. Your doctor will talk to you about your best treatment options. What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. You may have already had surgery or radiation. Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate. When your cancer spreads, your doctor will most likely suggest hormone therapy. That usually means taking medication to lower the amount of androgen hormones (testosterone and DHT) in your body or prevent them from affecting cancer cells. A related but rarely used option is surgical castration. The doctor removes your testicles, where most of these hormones are made. If you don't like the idea of losing them, the doctor can fit you with silicone sacs to insert into your scrotum. They'll preserve the look and feel. If hormone therapy doesn't work, you might move on to vaccine therapy. The prostate cancer vaccine is designed to kick-start your immune system so it attacks cancer cells. Or your doctor might suggest chemotherapy. It might be a medication you take by mouth, or something your doctor injects into a vein. If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals. You might think you'd know it if your cancer has spread, but that's not always true. Most men with advanced prostate cancer don't have any symptoms. This is why your follow-up doctor visits are important. You're most likely to find out the cancer has spread if your doctor tests your blood and finds high levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. He might also find it with a digital rectal exam or on an X-ray or other test. If you do have symptoms, they often include trouble peeing or blood in your urine. You might also feel very tired, short of breath, or lose weight without trying. You're more likely to feel pain if the cancer has gone into your bones. Where it hurts will depend on which bones it affects. For instance, you might feel hip or back pain if cancer has spread into your pelvic bones. No matter which treatments you decide to pursue, advanced prostate cancer is bound to take a toll on your day-to-day life. Loss of bladder control (incontinence), fatigue, and erectile dysfunction often go hand-in-hand with treatment. Men who have hormonal therapy may have hot flashes (similar to what many women have during menopause) or gain weight. Cancer that has spread to your bones can also be painful. Be sure to tell you doctor about any pain or side effects. There are a wide array of medications and procedures that can help you feel better. Self-care is also important: Take naps to fight fatigue and try to do some light exercise, like walking, to keep your energy levels up. Being active can also help combat weight gain, especially if you add some strength training to your routine. Check with your doctor first to make sure it's safe for you to exercise. He may suggest you work with a physical therapist."

249,"A variety of things -- including overuse, a common cold, a serious virus, or allergies â can cause a sore throat. Another culprit, especially in children and young adults, is the bacteria that creates strep throat. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) is the formal name of the bacterium. But how can you tell if it's strep and not something else? When you have strep, you'll usually find that your throat is quite raw and it really hurts to swallow. You'll find that it comes on very fast, not gradually like many other kinds of sore throats. Other symptoms often include: A fever of 101 F or higher Swollen lymph nodes on your neck Really little red spots on the back part of the roof of your mouth Red and swollen tonsils (two round lumps in the back of your throat; they are types of lymph nodes). You may also see white patches on them or elsewhere in your throat. Headache, sometimes with pain in the gut or vomiting. You might also see a red, sandpaper-like rash that starts in the face and neck area and then spreads to the rest of the body. This could be a sign of scarlet fever. You should call your doctor if you or a child in your care show any symptoms of strep or you see this rash. It's easy to confuse it with other conditions, so it helps to know what it's not: It's not a virus -- viruses can't be cured with antibiotics. It usually doesn't come with a runny nose, a cough, or red eyes. These are usually signs of a virus or allergy. It's not life-threatening. But if you leave it untreated, strep throat can lead to more serious complications in some cases. The bacteria that cause strep are highly contagious. You can spread it by close contact -- including sneezes and handshakes -- or sharing someone else's personal items. Be sure to wash your hands often and be cautious about touching objects when someone in your house has strep. If you or a child in your care has a sore throat lasting longer than 48 hours, problems swallowing, or sudden rash, call your doctor. Call 911 if you have any trouble breathing. For your little ones, call the doctor right away if: An infant is 12 weeks or younger and has a temperature of 100.4 F or higher A fever goes above 104 F in any child You should also contact her if: A child younger than 2 has a fever lasting more than 24 hours A child 2 or older has a fever for more than 72 hours Your doctor will ask questions and do tests to find out whether you have strep or something else. It can look a lot like other illnesses, including: Mononucleosis (which also features swollen glands, fever, and skin rash) Lyme disease (from a tick bite) Mumps (caused by a virus) One key sign of strep is how fast you or your child feels it develop. It comes on in about 72 hours. Though most sore throats get better on their own, strep throat should be treated with an antibiotic. Follow all of the instructions on how much and how long to take it. You can help stop the spread of strep by treating it early. You also lower the chance of getting complications. Your doctor tests for strep throat with a rapid antigen test. She swabs the back of your throat with a cotton-tipped stick to get a sample. You usually get results in about 20 minutes. If the test is negative (meaning no signs of strep are found), the doctor may do what's called a throat culture. She'll take more swab samples from the back of your throat and send them to a lab. You may have to wait a couple of days for those results. When you call your doctor's office to make your appointment, ask what details they need and instructions they might have. These may include: A list of symptoms A list of the medications you or your child takes Whether you need to fast Whether you or your young one has had strep throat before"
250,"If you have been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea -- a condition in which relaxation of the muscles around the tongue and throat causes the tissues to block airflow to the lungs while you sleep -- there are a number of treatment options to discuss with your doctor. Two of the most widely used and most effective are continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) and dental appliances, or mouth guards.  The most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, CPAP blows air with continuous pressure down your throat at night to keep your airways open while you sleep. The treatment is done using a CPAP machine, which consists of three main parts: Mask that fits over your nose -- or your nose and mouth -- and is held in place with straps while you sleep Motor that blows air Large tube called a cannula that connects the motor to the mask CPAP machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. If you travel, you should take your CPAP with you. Benefits of CPAP include keeping your airways open while you sleep, easing snoring, improving sleep quality, relieving daytime sleepiness, and lowering blood pressure. Although you will likely feel better rested and alert once you start CPAP, getting used to the device can take some time. Some people have difficulty sleeping the first few nights of treatment. Side effects of CPAP use are usually minor and may include: Feelings of confinement from the face mask Sore or dry mouth Nasal congestion, runny nose, sinusitis, or nosebleeds Irritation and sores over the bridge of the nose Stomach bloating and discomfort Discomfort in chest muscles. If you are having any of these or other problems, call your doctor. An adjustment to your CPAP machine may make it more comfortable. Some CPAP machines have special features such as heated humidifiers to reduce problems such as drying of the airways. Other possible fixes include using a cushioned face mask, chin straps, and nasal saltwater sprays. Your doctor may have additional suggestions. If you have mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea and can't tolerate or haven't been helped by CPAP, oral appliances may be an effective treatment option. These devices, which must be fitted by a dentist or orthodontist, and worn in the mouth at night include: Mandibular advancement device ( MAD). The most widely used mouth device for sleep apnea, MADs look much like a mouth guard used in sports. The devices snap over the upper and lower dental arches and have metal hinges that make it possible for the lower jaw to be eased forward. Some, such as the Thornton Adjustable Positioner ( TAP), allow you to control the degree of advancement. Tongue retaining device. Used less commonly than MAD, this device is a splint that holds the tongue in place to keep the airway open. For people with mild to moderate sleep apnea, particularly those who sleep on their backs or stomachs, dental devices may improve sleep and reduce the frequency and loudness of snoring. Also, people are more likely to use their dental appliances regularly than CPAP. Dental devices have also been shown to control sleep apnea long term compared to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ( UPPP), the standard surgical procedure for apnea, in which the surgeon removes soft tissue from the back of the throat. However, dental devices do have some potential drawbacks, including altered bite, movement of teeth, pain, arthritis of the temporal mandibular joint ( TMJ), dry lips, and excessive salivation. If you are fitted with a dental device you should have a checkup early on to see if it is working and periodic checkups for possible adjustment or replacement. If you experience pain or changes in your bite, your dentist or orthodontist who fitted your device may be able to make modifications to correct the problem. The best treatment for obstructive sleep apnea depends on a number of factors, including the severity of your problem, the physical structure of your upper airway, other medical problems you may have, as well as your personal preference. You should work with your doctor or sleep specialist to select the best treatment option for you."
251,"A neck lift is a set of procedures to enhance the appearance of your neck. Procedures can include: Removing excess skin Removing or altering neck muscles Liposuction to remove excess fat Botox injections to address problems with fullness or ""bands"" Kybella injections to remove excess fat under the chin Other neck lifting techniques involve lasers, ultrasound and radiofrequency devices, intense pulsed light, and fillers. You must be in good health to get a neck lift. You'll consult with your surgeon in advance. For that meeting, have your goals in mind for what you want to change. Here are some of the most common concerns that are addressed with a neck lift: Turkey wattle neck Excess fat Too much skin During your consultation, you should go over your goals and learn about the options: Turkey Wattle: Your surgeon may recommend surgery, which involves making cuts under your chin or behind your ears or both to access a neck muscle called the platysma. Sometimes, that may even mean removing some muscle. Newer procedures may let your surgeon make smaller cuts and use an endoscope (a small camera attached to a thin tube) to complete your surgery. Make sure you ask your surgeon for all your options during your consultation. You and your surgeon will discuss what type of anesthesia to use, depending on your level of comfort. If you want to remain asleep during the procedure, you should request general anesthesia. Otherwise, your surgeon can use local anesthesia with sedation. It's up to you, however, to make that choice. Instead of surgery or in addition to it, Botox injections can relax parts of the platysma that are responsible for the ""band"" appearance or look of fullness. Those injections can be done in 15 minutes on an outpatient basis, meaning no overnight stay. Liposuction : During liposuction, your surgeon will make a small cut below your chin and remove excess fat. If you are also getting other procedures, it is very common for cosmetic surgeons to begin with liposuction. You will be able to determine this with your doctor during your consultation. If this is the only procedure you're getting, you should plan on the operation lasting up to an hour. Your incisions will be stitched and bandaged. It's important to make sure you understand and follow your doctor's instructions on properly caring for the stitches and bandage. Too Much Skin on Your Neck: Your surgeon will trim parts of the skin and lift it into place, securing it with tissue glue or stitches. This takes about two to four hours, depending on the complexity of your procedure. Again, your type of anesthesia will depend on your own personal comfort level. Your surgeon will fit you with a compression bandage that you will have to wear for at least one week unless instructed otherwise. Your surgeon will tell you to avoid certain medications and supplements before your surgery to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding. Tell your doctor about any drug allergies you have. Although it's very rare, you could have an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. If you smoke, you will need to quit for at least four weeks before the surgery and four weeks after. Don't just plan to cut down. Not smoking for this time period is necessary for proper healing. Eat a healthy diet. That will help your body heal. You should plan to take at least one week off from work. Ask your doctor exactly how much time off you'll need. Set up an area in your home for recovery. The area should have: Ice packs Gauze and towels Thermometer Supply of comfortable, loose clothing (preferably button-down shirts or blouses that do not have to be pulled over your head and neck) Petroleum jelly and antibacterial ointment Telephone within reaching distance of where you'll be lying or sitting most of the time Pillows that will allow you to keep your head in a comfortable position Someone who can stay with you at least the first 24 hours after surgery On the day of surgery, wear loose, comfortable clothing. Wear a button-down blouse or shirt that you don't have to pull over your head and neck. You will have swelling and bruising that can last for several days after a neck lift. You may feel tightness or tingling and different sensations, including burning or pulling. You also will experience numbness. These are all normal in the first few weeks following surgery and should not be cause for concern. As with any surgery, infection is possible. Take your temperature. At the first sign of a fever, contact your doctor. If you have unusual discharge, such as pus, from the surgery site, contact your doctor immediately. Recovering from a neck lift takes time. Most people can return to work in 10 to 14 days. If you participate in sports or are physically active, you will have to wait three weeks or more to resume those activities. Give yourself time to heal to get the most benefit from the procedure. Most health insurance companies do not cover cosmetic surgery. Be clear on what, if anything, your insurance will cover before the surgery. That way, you'll know what to expect. If your procedures will correct a medical condition, tell your health insurer before the surgery. Your surgeon can write a letter detailing your case. With certain insurance plans, cosmetic or plastic surgery can affect future coverage. It can also affect your premiums. Make sure you ask your health insurer about that before you get the procedure, so you know what to expect."
252,"Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML) pushes your bone marrow to make large numbers of abnormal blood cells. These cells crowd out healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. AML treatments destroy unhealthy blood cells in your bone marrow and blood. The goal is to put you into remission, which means you have no symptoms of cancer. Several different treatments work on AML: Chemotherapy Stem cell transplant Radiation Targeted therapy Your treatment will have two phases: Phase 1: Remission induction therapy. You'll get high doses of chemotherapy to destroy as many leukemia cells as possible. You may need to stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 weeks so your doctor can see how you're doing and treat you for any side effects of chemotherapy. There are targeted therapy drugs as well. After treatment, your bone marrow should start to make healthy blood cells. Your doctor will take a bone marrow sample to see if any leukemia cells are left in your blood. If no leukemia cells are visible, doctors call that being âin remission.â You'll still need to go through post-remission therapy to help you stay in remission. Phase 2: Post-remission therapy. Post-remission therapy uses more treatments to wipe out any cancer cells that might have been left behind after chemotherapy. You have three options: Chemotherapy. You may get several cycles of high-dose chemotherapy once a month. Allogenic (from a donor) stem cell transplant Autologous (from yourself) stem cell transplant Chemotherapy uses strong drugs to kill cancer cells all over your body. You get these drugs by mouth, through an IV, or via an injection under your skin. If the cancer has spread, you'll get chemotherapy into the fluid around your brain and spinal cord. Doctors call this intrathecal chemotherapy. Side effects: Chemotherapy works by killing quickly dividing cells in your body. Cancer cells divide quickly, but so do other cells -- like those in your immune system, the lining of your mouth and intestines, and your hair follicles. When chemotherapy damages these healthy cells, you can have side effects like these: Nausea and vomiting Hair loss Mouth sores Fatigue Loss of appetite Diarrhea and constipation Easy bruising and bleeding Increased risk for infections Most of these side effects should go away once your treatment ends. Your doctor can give you medicines and other treatments to help you manage chemotherapy side effects. The higher the dose of chemotherapy you get, the more cancer cells it will kill. Yet high-dose chemotherapy can also damage your bone marrow and cause a dangerous drop in your blood cell levels. Your doctor can do a stem cell transplant after chemotherapy to replace your damaged bone marrow with young stem cells from your own body or from a donor. These stem cells will grow into new, healthy blood cells. There are two types of stem cell transplant: An allogenic stem cell transplant uses stem cells taken from a donor. This is the most common type of stem cell transplant. A close relative like a parent, brother, or sister will be the best match. One risk of an allogenic transplant is graft-versus-host disease. The donor's cells recognize your body as foreign and attack your organs and tissues. Symptoms include rashes, itching, nausea, diarrhea, mouth sores, and jaundice -- yellowing of the eyes and skin. An autologous stem cell transplant removes cells from your own bone marrow or blood before you have chemotherapy. Those cells are frozen and then put back into your blood after your treatment. Because the stem cells come from your body, there's less risk of rejection. The downside is that it's hard to separate healthy stem cells from leukemia cells. You might get some leukemia cells put back in during the transplant. After a stem cell transplant, you'll have to stay in the hospital for a while to be watched and treated for side effects. Because this treatment uses very high doses of chemotherapy, it can cause serious complications like these: Higher risk of infection and bleeding from low blood cell counts Damage to the lungs, bones, and thyroid gland Cataracts -- clouding of the clear outer cover of the eye Loss of fertility Another cancer years later Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL) is a subtype of AML that doctors treat a little differently. In APL, the leukemia cells contain special proteins that change the way your blood clots. Chemotherapy damages the leukemia cells and releases this protein, which can cause dangerous blood clots or severe bleeding. If you have APL, you'll get medicine to make your leukemia cells change into mature, healthy blood cells so they don't burst open and release their protein. The two drugs used to treat APL are: All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA). You might need to stay on this drug for a year or two. Side effects include a headache, fever, rash, mouth or throat sores, itching, and high cholesterol. Arsenic trioxide ( Trisenox). Side effects include tiredness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, belly pain, heart rhythm problems, and nerve damage. You might also get chemotherapy with these drugs. Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. You might get radiation to treat AML that has spread to your brain and spinal cord, or to your bone. Radiation is sometimes also used before a stem cell transplant. Usually adult AML is treated with external radiation therapy, which is given from outside of your body. Side effects from radiation include: Sunburn-like redness of the skin Mouth sores -- if you get radiation to your head or neck Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea -- if you get radiation to your belly Fatigue Bleeding or bruising Increased risk of infection If AML treatments don't work for you, or if they stop working and your cancer begins to grow again, you have another option: You can try a clinical trial. Clinical trials are studies in which researchers test new treatments. They often are a way for you to try a new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you, how to sign up, and what to consider first."
253,"A pelvic exam is a way for doctors to look for signs of illness in certain organs in a woman's body. The word ""pelvic"" refers to the pelvis. The exam is used to look at a woman's: Vulva (external genital organs) Uterus (the womb) Cervix (opening from the vagina to the uterus) Fallopian tubes (tubes that carry eggs to the womb) Ovaries (organs that produce eggs) Bladder (the sac that holds urine) Rectum (the chamber that connects the colon to the anus) Pelvic exams are performed: During a yearly physical exam When a woman is pregnant When a doctor is checking for an infection (such as chlamydia, vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and others) When a woman is having pain in her pelvic area or low back Because a Pap test is typically performed during a routine pelvic exam, you should schedule the exam when you are not having your period. In addition, for 48 hours prior to the exam, you should not: Douche Use a tampon Have sex Use birth control foam, cream, or jelly Use medicine or cream in your vagina You can expect to feel a little discomfort, but you should not feel pain during a pelvic exam. The exam itself takes about 10 minutes. If you have any questions during the exam, be sure to ask your doctor. During a typical pelvic exam, your doctor or nurse will: Ask you to take off your clothes in private ( You will be given a gown or other covering.) Talk to you about any health concerns Ask you to lie on your back and relax Press down on areas of the lower stomach to feel the organs from the outside Help you get in position for the speculum exam ( You may be asked to slide down to the end of the table.) Ask you to bend your knees and to place your feet in holders called stirrups Perform the speculum exam. During the exam, a device called a speculum will be inserted into the vagina. The speculum is opened to widen the vagina so that the vagina and cervix can be seen. Perform a Pap smear. Your doctor will use a plastic spatula and small brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix ( A sample of fluid also may be taken from the vagina to test for infection.) Remove the speculum. Perform a bimanual exam. Your doctor will place two fingers inside the vagina and uses the other hand to gently press down on the area he or she is feeling. Your doctor is noting if the organs have changed in size or shape. Sometimes a rectal exam is performed. Your doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum to detect any tumors or other abnormalities. Talk to you about the exam ( You may be asked to return to get test results.) A sample of cells may be taken as part of regular test called a Pap smear, or Pap test, to screen for cervical cancer or cells that look like they might lead to cancer. The sample is placed in a solution and sent to a lab where it is examined. Tests also may be taken to screen for sexually transmitted diseases. A Pap smear is recommended starting when women reach 21 years of age. Women ages 21-65 should have routine screening with Pap test every three years. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF) also recommends the option of having a human papillomavirus ( HPV) test or combining it with a Paptest starting after age 30. Women over age 65 can stop getting screened if they've had at least three consecutive negative Pap tests or at least two negative HPV tests within the previous 10 years, according to the guidelines. But women who have a history of a more advanced precancer diagnosis should continue to be screened for at least 20 years."
254,"Neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, is a disease that affects your eyes and spinal cord. It's also known as Devic's disease. It's not very common -- only about 4,000 people in the United States have it. NMO happens because your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your central nervous system (your brain and your spinal cord). These attacks can happen over days or weeks -- this is called monophasic NMO. Or you may go a long time between attacks, even months or years. This is called relapsing NMO. With relapsing NMO, symptoms go away but can come back and get worse over time. Men and women are equally likely to get the monophasic type, but women get relapsing NMO much more often than men. Children also can get the disease. The signs of NMO fall into two categories. See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: Optic neuritis: inflammation of the optic nerve (this carries information from your eye to your brain). You might feel sudden pain inside your eye. That can be followed by problems like not seeing clearly or even blindness. It usually happens only in one eye, but it can happen in both. Transverse myelitis: inflammation of the spinal cord. This can cause problems with your arms and legs, including pain, weakness, numbness, or paralysis. It also can lead to loss of control of your bladder and bowel. You could have nausea, vomiting, hiccups, a stiff neck, or a headache. Children who have NMO may seem confused, have seizures, or fall into a coma. Another condition that also causes inflammation and can make it hard to move is multiple sclerosis ( MS). Doctors used to think NMO was a type of MS. Now research shows they're different: MS usually happens more slowly and over a longer time. There is a blood test for NMO, but there is no blood test for MS. An MRI usually looks normal when you first get NMO but not with MS. With NMO, you might have nausea, vomiting, and hiccups. This doesn't usually happen with MS. Doctors aren't sure what causes NMO. It doesn't seem to run in families, but many people who have it also have other autoimmune diseases, in which your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells. Or they may have family members who have them. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and vitiligo. Your doctor will examine you and check your thinking, vision, speech, strength, and reflexes. He may want to test fluid from your spine and your blood. More than 70% of people who have NMO have a certain protein in their blood called an antibody. Your doctor also may want to look at your spine to see if it's inflamed. One way to do that is with a test called an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). It uses a large magnet and a computer to create an image of your spinal cord. You also might need to see a doctor who specializes in treating eyes (ophthalmologist). There's no cure for NMO, but you can do things to feel better or treat an attack. Symptoms often get better with steroids or corticosteroids that help with inflammation. Other drugs may help keep your body from fighting off the good cells and prevent future attacks. You also might need several medicines to treat symptoms such as pain or bladder or bowel issues. Your doctor also might suggest a treatment called plasmapheresis. This is when your blood is circulated through a machine that gets rid of the antibodies."
255," The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that all men have. It's found below your bladder and in front of your rectum. The job of the prostate is to make fluid that contains sperm (semen). This fluid protects the sperm when they travel toward a female's egg. If your prostate becomes swollen, tender, and inflamed, you have a condition called âprostatitis.â This isn't cancer, and it's different from having an âenlarged prostate.â There are four types of prostatitis. Each has its own set of symptoms and causes. These include: Acute bacterial prostatitis. Your urinary tract is made up of your kidneys, bladder, and the tubes that pass between them. If bacteria from here finds its way into your prostate, you can get an infection. This type of prostatitis comes on quickly. You might suddenly have: Urgent need to pee but only a little comes out, or you have to get to the toilet quickly to prevent an accident High fever Chills Trouble peeing Pain around the base of your penis or behind your scrotum Cloudy urine Acute bacterial prostatitis is a severe condition. If you notice these symptoms, seek medical care right away. Chronic bacterial prostatitis. This is more common in older men. It's a milder bacterial infection that can linger for several months. Some men get it after they've had a urinary tract infection ( UTI) or acute bacterial prostatitis. The symptoms of chronic bacterial prostatitis often come and go. This makes them easy to miss. With this condition, you might sometimes have: An urgent need to pee, often in the middle of the night Painful urination Pain after you ejaculate (release semen at orgasm) Lower back pain Rectum pain A âheavyâ feeling behind your scrotum Blood in your semen Urinary blockage (dfficulty peeing or a weak urine stream) Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CP/ CPPS). This is the most common type of prostatitis. It shares many of the same signs as bacterial prostatitis. The difference is that when tests are run, no bacteria are present with this type. Doctors aren't sure what causes CP/ CPPS. Triggers include stress, nearby nerve damage, and physical injury. Chemicals in your urine or a UTI you had in the past may play a role. CP/ CPPS has also been linked to immune disorders like chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS). The main symptom of CP/ CPPS is pain that lasts more than 3 months in at least one of these body parts: Penis (often at the tip) Scrotum Between your scrotum and rectum (the perineum) Lower abdomen You may also have pain when you pee or ejaculate. You might not be able to hold your urine, or you may have to pee more than 8 times a day. A weak urine stream is another common symptom of CP/ CPPS. Asymptomatic prostatitis. Men who have this type of prostatitis have an inflamed prostate but no symptoms. You may only learn you have it if your doctor does a blood test that checks your prostate health. Asymptomatic prostatitis doesn't need any treatment, but it can lead to infertility. You're more likely to have problems with your prostate if: You've had a UTI You've had a groin injury You use a urinary catheter You've had a prostate biopsy You have HIV/ AIDS You've had prostatitis before An inflamed or infected prostate gland is common in men of all ages. If you have prostatitis, your doctor can help you find ways to manage your symptoms and control your pain. Researchers are also trying to better understand what causes it. This will allow them to find more treatments that work."
256,"Doctors diagnose heart failure by taking a medical history and conducting a physical exam and tests. During the medical history your doctor will want to know if: You have any other health problems such as diabetes, kidney disease, angina (chest pain), high blood pressure, or other heart problems You smoke You drink alcohol, and if so, how much You are taking medications. During the physical, the doctor will check your blood pressure, use a stethoscope to hear sounds associated with heart failure in the heart and lungs, and look for swollen neck veins, an enlarged liver, and swollen feet. Tests your doctor might order to diagnose heart failure include: Blood tests to check for anemia, thyroid problems, and high cholesterol, conditions that can be related to heart failure. There is also a blood test for B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP), which can indicate active heart failure. Urine tests to look for signs of kidney problems or diabetes, a cause of heart disease Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG) to assess the heart rate and rhythm. This test can often detect heart disease, heart attack, an enlarged heart, or abnormal heart rhythms that may cause heart failure. Chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged and if the lungs are congested with fluid. Echocardiogram , an ultrasound test, to evaluate heart muscle function, to see how well the heart is pumping, and to detect problems with the heart valves that may cause heart failure. Ejection fraction ( EF) also can be measured. EF is a measure of how much blood is pumped out of the heart with each beat, and how much blood pumps through the heart with each beat. A normal EF is generally greater than 50%, which means that over half of the blood volume in the heart's main pumping chamber is pumped out with each beat. Radionuclide ventriculography to show the pumping function of the left and right ventricles (the heart's large pumping chambers) during heart contractions. This test can also measure EF. Rarely performed by itself, this test may be part of an exercise stress test. Cardiac MRIto distinguish scar from normal tissue and abnormalities in the heart muscle. This can also measure EF. This test is generally available only in large heart centers and is rarely used as a first step in heart disease diagnosis. Exercise stress test, an ECG performed while either walking on a treadmill, riding a stationary bike, or using medications to simulate exercise to check for any heart function problems brought on by exercise, which may indicate coronary artery disease. In addition, your doctor may perform a variety of more invasive tests, such as cardiac catheterization, to directly visualize the heart's chambers. This test can determine if coronary artery disease is present and can also provide a measure of EF. Treatment of heart failure focuses on slowing or reversing its progression. The earlier treatment starts, the better the outcome. After a diagnosis, your doctor will recommend a series of lifestyle changes. You may be asked to reach and maintain a healthy weight, increase your activity level (as recommended by your doctor), restrict salt intake, restrict fluid intake, and avoid alcohol. If you smoke or chew tobacco, you'll be advised to stop. You will need to work with your doctor to find the right balance of rest and activity -- mobility is important to keep blood circulating. You will also need to weigh yourself daily and record your weight to detect fluid retention. Your doctor will also prescribe several medications to manage your heart failure or the underlying problem that caused the heart failure. Drugs used to treat heart failure, often in combination, include: Diuretics or water pills to help the body eliminate excess salt and water. Examples include: bumetanide ( Bumex), chlorothiazide ( Diuril), Microzide, Esidrix), furosemide ( Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide ( Hydrodiuril, indapamide ( Lozol), metolazone ( Zaroxolyn), spironolactone/hydrochlorothiazide ( Aldactazide), spironolactone ( Aldactone), torsemide ( Demadex), and triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide ( Maxide), and triamterene ( Dyazide). ACE inhibitors , which have a multitude of beneficial effects in patients with heart failure, including serving as vasodilators -- they expand blood vessels and increase blood flow, thus helping the heart pump more efficiently. ACE inhibitors are important heart failure drugs since they have been shown to significantly prolong life and improve the quality of life for most people with heart failure. ACE inhibitors include: captopril ( Capoten), enalapril ( Vasotec), fosinopril ( Monopril), lisinopril ( Prinivil, Zestril), quinapril ( Accupril), ramipril ( Altace) and trandolapril ( Mavik). Angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBS) work in similar ways as ACE inhibitors. They are prescribed when patients develop side effects to ACE inhibitors, such as cough or high potassium levels. Angiotensin Receptor- Neprilysin Inhibitor ( ARNs) is a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor and an ARB. Approved in 2015, Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is seen as a possible replacement for ACE inhibitors or other ARB. Beta-blockers can improve the heart's ability to relax, and decrease the production of harmful hormones produced by the body in response to heart failure. Beta-blockers used to treat heart failure include carvedilol ( Coreg) and metoprolol. Digoxin , sold under the brand name Lanoxin, may improve heart pumping function and control certain heart rhythm problems. Digoxin is an older medication and not used as frequently as in the past, because many of the newer agents appear to have more profound effects on symptom control and overall outcome. Nevertheless, it may still be a reasonable add-on for those patients in whom symptoms don't improve with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Potassium supplementsreplace the potassium that may be lost because of increased urination from diuretics. Selective sinus node inhibitors is a new class of drug which targets a specific area of the heart, the sinoatrial pacemaker. The first of these drugs is ivabradine ( Corlanor) which lowers the heart rate and helps the lower left ventricle contract more efficiently. Some of these drugs may cause unwanted side effects. Always discuss problems you may be experiencing with your doctor before stopping or decreasing the dose of any prescribed medications. In some cases, when drugs don't improve heart function enough or cannot be tolerated, surgery or other intervention is necessary. Doctors recommend surgery for several major reasons: to correct certain problems that cause heart failure (such as coronary-artery bypass graft surgery), to repair or replace valves, to implant devices (such as an intra-aortic balloon pump, specialized pacemakers, ICDs, or ventricular-assist devices) to help the heart pump, or to transplant a new heart. Heart transplants are used to treat severe CHF."
257,"To do its job well, your tongue needs to be able reach almost every part of your mouth. That full range of motion lets you make different sounds when you speak. It also helps you swallow and sweep away bits of food to keep your mouth clean. But for babies with tongue-tie, there's a problem with something called the lingual frenulum. That's the small stretch of tissue that connects the underside of your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. It might be too short and tight, or attached way up near the tip of the tongue. Either way, it ties the tongue in place. For some, it's not much of an issue. For others, it can lead to problems breastfeeding. Later on, it can affect eating and speaking. Doctors don't always check for it, and it's not always easy to notice. But even if your child's pediatrician doesn't find it until later, it can be treated. Usually, the lingual frenulum separates from the tongue before your baby is born. But sometimes it doesn't. Doctors aren't sure why. It may run in families. We do know that boys are 3 times more likely to get it than girls. It's often found because of problems breastfeeding. You may notice your baby: Can't latch well Tends to chew more than suck Doesn't gain weight the way you'd expect Feeds for a long time, takes a short break, then feeds for another long stretch Is fussy when trying to feed Makes a clicking sound while feeding Seems hungry all the time Along with symptoms, you may hurt during and after breastfeeding. You may also have sore or cracked nipples. But tongue-tie isn't the only reason there may be breastfeeding problems. So if you're having them, talk to your doctor. You might also notice your baby's tongue: Can't move far from side to side Can't reach the upper gums or roof of the mouth Can't stick out past the gums Has a V shape or heart shape at its tip when it's sticking out A physical exam is all it takes to see what's going on. The doctor will: Ask how feeding is going Check your child's tongue, mouth, and teeth Use a tongue depressor, which is like a big popsicle stick, to look under your child's tongue and check the range of motion The doctor may ask older kids to move their tongue around and make certain sounds, like of an r or l. Not all doctors agree on this. Some say to take care of it right away to ward off any issues. Others think it's better to wait. That's because it might not cause any problems or may loosen up over time. There's no way to know for sure what'll happen. If it's not treated, it can also lead to: Dental problems like tooth decay, swollen and irritated gums, and a gap between the lower two front teeth Gagging or choking on foods as your child starts to eat solids A hard time with basic things, like licking an ice cream cone and kissing Trouble saying d, l, n, r, s, t, th, and z sounds. Rolling an r can be especially hard. Talk it through with your doctor to learn what's best for you and your baby. There are two ways to take care of tongue-tie: Frenotomy: This basic procedure happens in a doctor's office. Sometimes you don't even need numbing drugs. The doctor takes a pair of specially cleaned scissors and clips the frenulum, which doesn't have many nerves or blood vessels. That means there's not much pain. And if there's any blood at all, it's a drop or two at most. Your baby can breastfeed right away, which can be soothing and healing. Frenuloplasty. When the frenulum is too thick for a quick snip, your pediatrician will choose this option. The doctor will: Give your child drugs so they sleep through the whole thing Use special tools to cut the frenulum Put in a few stitches that dissolve on their own as the wound heals Some hospitals may use a laser instead. In that case, your child won't need stitches. Both are usually very successful and prevent any speech, dental, or eating problems. It's rare for either one to cause any issues. As with any medical procedure though, there are risks, such as: Bleeding Damage to the tongue or the glands that make saliva Infection A frenuloplasty can also lead to scarring. And your child could have a reaction to the drugs used to help him sleep."
258,"Sun poisoning doesn't really mean you've been poisoned. It is often the term used for a severe case of sunburn. This is usually a burn from ultraviolet ( UV) radiation that inflames your skin.  Within just 15 minutes of being in the sun, you can be sunburned. But you might not know it right away. The redness and discomfort might not show up for a few hours. You can become severely sunburned if you stay in the sun a long time and don't wear protection. You are more likely to sunburn if you have light skin and fair hair. Severe sunburn or sun poisoning can cause symptoms such as the following: Skin redness and blistering Pain and tingling Swelling Headache Fever and chills Nausea Dizziness Dehydration For severe sunburn, these simple remedies usually do the trick: Get out of the sun. Take a cool (not cold) shower or bath or apply cool compresses. Drink extra fluids for a few days. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen to relieve pain. Use aloe gel or a moisturizer. Completely cover sunburned areas when going outside. Seek immediate medical care for these symptoms: A sunburn that forms blisters, covers a large area, or is very painful Facial swelling Fever and chills Upset stomach Headache, confusion, or faintness Signs of dehydration Follow the basics of sun safety: Wear a sunscreen that has an SPF of at least 30 and says ""broad-spectrum"" on the label, which means that it protects against the sun's UVA and UVB rays. Put it on all over about 15 to 30 minutes before going out in the sun. Reapply at least every 2 hours and after you've been sweating or in the water. Limit your sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and remember that water, snow, and sand can intensify the sun's damaging rays. Wear sunglasses, a hat, and protective clothing. Check on your medications. Ask your doctor if anything you take might make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. For example, some acne medications, antibiotics, antidepressants, diuretics, heart drugs, and birth control pills make skin more sensitive. So can some antibacterial medications and fragrances that go on your skin. Sun poisoning may also refer to two types of reactions to sunlight: Polymorphous light eruption ( PMLE). PMLE is a reaction that does not appear to be linked to drugs or diseases. It happens in people who are at risk and who are exposed to intense sunlight that they're not used to. For example, people living in northern climates could experience this if taking a winter vacation in a tropical climate. Symptoms are a severe skin rash, usually appearing several hours after going out in the sun. The rash may be itchy and include: Small bumps over the sun-exposed areas of the body Dense clumps of bumps Hives, usually on the arms, lower legs, and chest An inherited form of PMLE occurs in Native Americans. It can last from spring until fall. Symptoms at first include redness, burning, and itching, which usually last 2 or 3 days but can persist for weeks. Other symptoms may begin within a few hours of sun exposure but go away in a few hours. They include: Fatigue Chills Headache Nausea Treatment for PMLE depends on its severity. Other than staying out of the sun and protecting yourself when you are in the sun, you may not need treatment. The rash can clear by itself within 7 to 10 days. Solar urticaria. Symptoms may develop within minutes of exposure to sun. If large areas of skin are involved, symptoms may include: Itchiness Redness Raised areas on the skin (hives or wheals) Wheezing Dizziness Loss of consciousness Although the rash usually goes away within hours, you may experience the reaction off and on throughout the years. Antihistamines can treat some cases, but see your doctor for advice. Other treatment or prevention for PMLE or solar urticaria may include: Steroids that go on your skin Sunscreen that says ""broad-spectrum"" on the label, which means it protects against the sun's UVA and UVB radiation Phototherapy with psoralen UV light ( PUVA) to desensitize skin to UV light"
259,"Too many late nights. Too much screen time. Long flights. Menopause. Lots of things can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty, and sore. But dry eyes can also be related to a medical condition that affects your immune system like diabetes, lupus, or HIV. And sometimes dry eyes are the first sign of a deeper problem. There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases. They're called that because your immune system attacks your healthy tissue by mistake instead of invading germs and viruses. One thing all these diseases have in common is inflammation, which can lead to pain, swelling, and other trouble. This inflammation can show up almost anywhere in your body. Sometimes that's far away from a disease's main target of, for example, your skin or your joints. Inflammation can damage your tear glands, so they don't make enough fluid. Or it can target oil glands in your eyelids; without oil, your tears evaporate too soon. Either way, your eyes get dry. Most people with diabetes know that it can cause eye problems like retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. While infrequent, people with diabetes may have dry eyes, as well. That's because the nerve damage that causes you to lose feeling in your hands, legs, and feet -- so you don't notice cuts and sores -- can also affect your eyes. Severe dryness that's not treated can damage your cornea, the dome that covers the front part of your eye. If you have diabetes, get your eyes checked regularly, perhaps every year, including the corneas. If you don't have it and you have dry eyes, especially if your vision is blurry and you're often thirsty, too, you may want to get tested for diabetes. This type of arthritis can target almost any part of your body, including your eyes. Some people with RA have a second autoimmune disease called Sjogren's syndrome, which dries out both your eyes and mouth. Having lupus makes you more likely to get many eye problems, but the most common is dry eye. Inflammation damages your tear-making glands, so they can't make enough moisture to keep your eyes healthy. The inflammation with this thyroid disease pulls and stretches the muscles around your eyes, so they bulge out a bit. When you can't shut your eyes tight, your tears will evaporate too fast. How autoimmune problems are treated depends on the disease, but keeping inflammation under control is key. If you have very dry eyes, you may need long-term anti-inflammatory eye drops or punctal (tear duct) plugs to prevent drainage. You can also do a lot on your own to ease symptoms: Use artificial tears during the day and ointments at night. ( But eye drops that prevent redness make dryness worse.) Avoid sitting next to air conditioners and heaters. Use a humidifier in your bedroom at night. Don't smoke. Take frequent screen breaks. Blink often. Eat more fish, or ask your doctor about taking fish oil pills. Omega-3 fatty acids in salmon, tuna, and sardines help block inflammation and may make your eyes feel better."
260,"Perioral dermatitis is a facial rash that causes bumps to develop around the mouth. In some cases, a similar rash may appear around the eyes, nose, forehead, or sometimes the genitals. The condition is most commonly seen in young women (90% of cases), but it can affect men as well. The exact cause of perioral dermatitis is not known. It may be from an external source that is irritating your skin such as toothpaste or a skin care product, or something that you are allergic to. However, it may appear after topical steroid creams are applied to the face to treat other conditions. $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); Perioral dermatitis results in bumps around the skin of the mouth, and a rash may appear around the eyes, nose, forehead, or sometimes the genitals. The condition usually is characterized by an uncomfortable burning sensation around the mouth. A doctor is likely to diagnose perioral dermatitis based on the skin's appearance. No tests are usually done. In some cases, a culture for bacteria may be needed to eliminate the possibility of infection. To treat perioral dermatitis, discontinue the use of all topical steroid medications and facial creams. You may need to change your skin care routine, by using fragrance-free cleansers and moisturizers, not scrubbing, and gently patting dry your skin. Oral or topical antibiotics or a combination of them, used as an anti-inflammatory drug, for 6 to 12 weeks may also be prescribed."
261,"Arthritis is a general term for a group of more than 100 diseases. The word ""arthritis"" means ""joint inflammation."" Inflammation is one of the body's natural reactions to disease or injury, and includes swelling, pain, and stiffness. Inflammation that lasts for a very long time or recurs, as in arthritis, can lead to tissue damage. A joint is where two or more bones come together, such as the hip or knee. The bones of a joint are covered with a smooth, spongy material called cartilage, which cushions the bones and allows the joint to move without pain. The joint is lined by the synovium. The synovium's lining produces a slippery fluid -- called synovial fluid -- that nourishes the joint and helps limit friction within. External to it is a strong fibrous casing called the joint capsule. Strong bands of tissue, called ligaments, connect the bones and help keep the joint stable. Muscles and tendons also support the joints and enable you to move. With arthritis, an area in or around a joint becomes inflamed, causing pain, stiffness and, sometimes, difficulty moving. Some types of arthritis also affect other parts of the body, such as the skin and internal organs. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. Some of the more common types include: Osteoarthritis : This is the most common type of arthritis. It occurs when the cartilage covering the end of the bones gradually wears away. Without the protection of the cartilage, the bones begin to rub against each other and the resulting friction leads to pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, but most often affects the hands and weight-bearing joints such as the knee, hip, and facet joints (in the spine). Osteoarthritis often occurs as the cartilage breaks down, or degenerates, with age. For this reason, osteoarthritis is sometimes called degenerative joint disease. Rheumatoid arthritis: RA is a long-lasting disease that can affect joints in any part of the body, but most commonly involves the hands, wrists, and knees. With rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system -- the body's defense system against disease -- mistakenly attacks the body's jointsand causes the joint lining to swell. The inflammation then spreads to the surrounding tissues, and can eventually damage cartilage and bone. In more severe cases, rheumatoid arthritis can affect other areas of the body, such as the skin, eyes, and nerves. Gout : Gout is a painful condition that occurs when the body cannot eliminate a natural substance called uric acid. The excess uric acid forms needle-like crystals in the joints that cause marked inflammation with swelling and severe pain. Gout most often affects the big toe, knee, and wrist joints. Different types of arthritis have different symptoms and the symptoms vary in severity from person to person. Osteoarthritis does not generally cause any symptoms outside the joint. Symptoms of other types of arthritis may include fatigue, fever, a rash and the signs of joint inflammation, including: Pain Swelling Stiffness Tenderness Redness Warmth Joint deformity The cause of most types of arthritis is unknown. It's likely that there are many different causes. Researchers are examining the role of genetics (heredity) and lifestyle behaviors in the development of arthritis. Although the exact cause of arthritis may not be known, there are several risk factors for arthritis. A risk factor is a trait or behavior that increases a person's chance of developing a disease or predisposes a person to a certain condition. Risk factors for arthritis include: Age. The risk of developing arthritis, especially osteoarthritis, increases with age. Gender. In general, arthritis occurs more frequently in women than in men. Obesity. Being overweight puts extra stress on weight-bearing joints, increasing wear and tear, and increasing the risk of arthritis, especially osteoarthritis. Work factors. Some jobs that require repetitive movements or heavy lifting can stress the joints and/or cause an injury, which can lead to arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis. Your genetic makeup. Certain types of arthritis run in families and are at least partially inherited. Arthritis is very common. It has been estimated that as many as 70 million Americans -- or about one in three -- have some form of arthritis or joint pain. It is a major cause of lost work time and serious disability for many people. Osteoarthritis, the most common form, affects more than 20 million Americans. Arthritis affects people of all ages, but is more common in older adults. Osteoarthritis is typically diagnosed with a complete medical history, including a description of your symptoms, and physical examination. Imaging techniques -- such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) -- are sometimes used to show the condition of the joints. If other types of arthritis are suspected, laboratory tests on blood, urine, and/or joint fluid may be helpful in determining the type of arthritis. These tests also can help rule out other diseases as the cause of your symptoms. The goal of treatment is to provide pain relief, increase joint mobility and strength, and control the disease to the extent that it is possible. Treatment options include medication, exercise, heat/cold compresses, use of joint protection, and surgery. Your treatment plan may involve more than one of these options. With early diagnosis, most types of arthritis can be managed and the pain and disability minimized. In addition, early diagnosis and treatment may be able to prevent tissue damage caused by arthritis. Early, aggressive treatment is particularly important for rheumatoid arthritis in order to help prevent further damage and disability down the road. Although it may not be possible to prevent arthritis, there are steps to take to reduce your risk of developing the disease and to slow or prevent permanent joint damage. These include: Maintaining a healthy weight. Excess weight puts strain on your joints. Exercising. Keeping your muscles strong can help protect and support your joints. Using joint-protecting devices and techniques at work. Proper lifting and posture can help protect your muscles and joints. Eating a healthy diet. A well balanced, nutritious diet can help strengthen your bones and muscles."
262,"Lupus nephritis is inflammation of the kidney that is caused by systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE). Also called lupus, SLE is an autoimmune disease. With lupus, the body's immune system targets its own body tissues. Lupus nephritis happens when lupus involves the kidneys. Up to 60% of lupus patients will develop lupus nephritis. When the kidneys are inflamed, they can't function normally and can leak protein. If not controlled, lupus nephritis can lead to kidney failure. Lupus nephritis is a serious problem. Its symptoms, though, are not always dramatic. For many, the first noticeable symptom is swelling of the legs, ankles and feet. Less often, there can be swelling in the face or hands. Other symptoms can vary from person to person and from day to day. They may include: Weight gain High blood pressure Dark urine Foamy, frothy urine The need to urinate during the night Not all urinary or kidney problems in people with lupus are due to lupus nephritis. People with lupus may also be prone to urinary tract infections. These cause burning on urination and require treatment with antibiotics. Certain lupus medications can also affect the kidneys and cause swelling and other symptoms similar to those of lupus nephritis. Problems related to these drugs usually go away when the drugs are no longer used. The diagnosis of lupus nephritis begins with a medical history, physical exam, and evaluation of symptoms. You doctor will likely order tests to make or confirm a diagnosis. Tests used in diagnosing kidney problems include urine tests, blood tests, imaging tests such as ultrasound, and kidney biopsy. There are five different types of lupus nephritis. Treatment is based on the type of lupus nephritis, which is determined by the biopsy. Since symptoms and severity vary from person to person, treatments are individually tailored to meet a person's particular circumstances. Medications used in treatment can include: Corticosteroids. These strong anti-inflammatory drugs can decrease inflammation. Doctors may prescribe these until the lupus nephritis improves. Because these drugs can cause a variety of potentially serious side effects, they must be monitored carefully. Doctors generally taper down the dosage once the symptoms start to improve. Immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs, which are related to the ones used to treat cancer or prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, work by suppressing immune system activity that damages the kidneys. They include cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan), azathioprine ( Imuran) and mycophenolate ( Cellcept). Medications to prevent blood clots or lower blood pressure if needed Even with treatment, loss of kidney function sometimes progresses. If both kidneys fail, people with lupus nephritis may need dialysis. Dialysis involves filtering the blood through a machine to remove waste products from the body. Ultimately, it may be necessary to have a kidney transplant. In those cases, people will need additional drugs to keep their immune system from rejecting the transplanted kidney. Certain lifestyle habits can help protect the kidneys. People with lupus nephritis should do the following: Drink enough fluids to stay well hydrated. Eat a low-sodium diet, especially if hypertension is an issue. Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Exercise regularly. Maintain a healthy blood pressure. Limit cholesterol. Avoid medications that can affect the kidneys, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). Your doctor may also recommend that you eat a diet low in potassium, phosphorus, and protein if there is already loss of kidney function. Although lupus nephritis is a serious problem, most people who receive treatment do not go on to have kidney failure."
263,"Anyone who has had a case of shingles is relieved when the rash it causes finally starts to go away. But if you still feel pain even after your skin has cleared up, you might have a condition called postherpetic neuralgia. About 1 out of 5 people who had shingles will get this lingering effect and doctors don't know exactly why. The pain can get better after a few months, though some cases last even longer. Medications can help control it. You should call your doctor if you've had shingles and you still hurt after your other symptoms are gone. People with this condition say it can feel like an electric shock. You may feel tingling along with burning or stabbing sensations. Your skin can be highly sensitive to touch, and you find it hard to wear clothes because of the way they rub on you. It is something of a journey from infection to postherpetic neuralgia, and you can think of it in 3 steps. Step 1: It all starts with a virus called varicella-zoster. You probably know about the first kind of itchy outbreak it causes if you get infected -- chickenpox. After that runs its course, the virus then âhides outâ in your nervous system. It can stay that way for many decades. Step 2: Sometimes this virus reawakens years later and travels along pathways to your skin. Lesions can erupt, often on one side of your torso or face. That's shingles. Doctors aren't sure exactly why the virus reactivates. Step 3: In some cases, shingles can cause inflammation of your nerve fibers and roots and damage them. They can't send messages from your skin to your brain as they usually do. That scramble of signals can trigger the ongoing pain of neuralgia, and sometimes it can be severe. You feel the pain in the same areas where the rash broke out. If the pain lasts more than a year, it can become permanent. Not everyone who has shingles will have these sharp, ongoing pains afterward. But doctors have found a number of things that can increase your chances of getting it. They include: Age: People who are older than 60. Some people from 50 to 59 with certain medical problems that could weaken their immune systems or who have ongoing pain or skin conditions may want to consider the vaccine. Talk to your doctor to find out more if you fall into this group. Gender: Women seem to get it more than men. Early symptoms: People who have numbness, tingling, or itching before a shingles rash even appears tend to get the lingering pain later. Pain at the start: If you had severe pain or rash during the beginning of your outbreak, you have a greater chance of the neuralgia later. Other health problems: People with ongoing conditions that can weaken the immune system, such as HIV and cancer, seem more likely to get it. Talk to your doctor if you have ongoing pain long after your shingles rash has gone away. She can come up with a mix of treatments to help you ease the symptoms."
264,"The Bartholin's glands are located on each side of the vaginal opening. They're about the size of a pea. They produce fluid that keeps the vagina moist. The fluid travels to the vagina through ducts (tubes). If they become blocked, fluid can back up into them. This forms a swelling -- a cyst. Doctors call these Bartholin's gland cysts. Most of the time, they don't hurt. They're almost always benign, or non-cancerous. Doctors aren't sure why the glands sometimes become blocked. In rare cases, it may be due to a sexually transmitted infection ( STI) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. About two out of 10 women can expect to get a Bartholin's gland cyst at some point. It typically happens in your 20s. They're less likely to develop as you age. You may not have any, unless the cyst is large or becomes infected. If infection sets in (doctors call this an âabscessâ), you'll likely have extreme pain at the site of the cyst. Sex -- and even walking -- may hurt. If the cyst is large, it can make one side of your labia majora (the large folds of skin on the outside of your vagina) hang lower than the other. You might also have fever and an unusual vaginal discharge. Only your doctor can tell you for sure. He'll do a physical exam. He'll also likely take a sample of your vaginal discharge and look at it under a microscope. This will reveal whether you have an STI. If you have an abscess, he'll take a culture of it and send it to a lab. If you're over 40, he may do a biopsy (sample of tissue from the cyst) to rule out vulvar cancer. That's a disease that affects the lips that surround your vagina. If your exam shows that you have an STI, or if your cyst is infected, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. He may also prescribe topical medications. If you're under 40 and your cyst isn't causing problems, you probably won't need treatment. A simple sitz bath may help the cyst go away on its own. Simply fill a tub with 3 to 4 inches of water (enough to cover your vulva), and gently sit. Do this several times a day for three or four days. The cyst may burst and drain on its own. If the Bartholin's cyst is causing problems -- or if it's turned into an abscess -- you'll need to see your doctor. He'll treat it in one of three ways: Surgical drainage. Your doctor will make a small cut in the cyst. He'll then place a small rubber tube (catheter) into the opening to allow it to drain. It can stay in place for up to 6 weeks. You'll feel better right away after the fluid has been drained. But you may need to take oral pain medication for several days afterwards. Keep in mind that a Bartholin's cyst or abscess may come back and need treatment again. Side effects include pain or discomfort -- especially during sex. You might also have swelling of the labia (lips around the vagina), infection, bleeding, or scarring. Marsupialization. If cysts bother you or come back, this procedure may help. Your doctor cuts the cyst to open it. He then stitches the skin around the cyst to form a small pouch. This allows the fluid to drain out. He packs the area with special gauze to soak up the fluid and any blood. The whole process takes less than half an hour, and you can go home the same day. Your doctor may prescribe painkillers afterward. There's also a risk of infection, bleeding, and the abscess coming back. Removal of the gland. Your doctor might recommend this option if others haven't worked or you keep getting Bartholin's cysts and abscesses. This surgery takes about an hour and you'll receive anesthesia so you're not awake for it. Many patients are able to go home after the procedure. Some possible problems include bleeding, bruising, and infection."
265," When your hands and feet itch, the right treatment can bring you some relief. How you treat the itching, though, depends a lot on the cause of the problem. It may just be dry skin, which can be brought on by winter weather or too much scrubbing. But sometimes, itchy hands and feet can signal another health condition. Could It Be Psoriasis? Psoriasis happens when skin cells grow too fast and then pile up on the skin's surface. It's a long-lasting condition that usually runs in families. There are a few different types, and itchiness of the palms and soles is a common symptom. If you have psoriasis, you may also have: Patches of red skin, bumps filled with puss, or silver scales Painful, swollen, or stiff joints Soreness of the affected area Itchiness in other places like your elbows, knees, lower back, and face Could It Be Eczema? Eczema is a term for a group of conditions that inflame the skin. There are several different types that can show up anywhere on the body. But one type, called dyshidrotic dermatitis, affects only the hands and feet. Besides the urge to scratch, symptoms of dyshidrotic dermatitis include: Clear blisters Red, cracked skin Scaly skin Could It Be Scabies? An eight-legged bug, called the human itch mite, is the source of this common skin condition. The tiny pest digs into the top layer of your skin and lays eggs there, causing scabies. The condition tends to spread in very crowded areas, where people have a lot of skin-to-skin contact that happens over a long time. You usually can't get scabies from quick touching, like a handshake or a hug. Itchy hands and feet are common in infants and young kids with scabies, but not adults. It also causes: Itchiness, especially at night, of the entire body or specific areas, like the wrist, elbow, armpit, and the webbing between fingers Pimply rash Tiny blisters and scales Sores Grayish-white or skin-colored âburrowsâ that look like lines Could It Be Diabetes? A skin problem is sometimes the first sign that you have diabetes. One of these skin conditions is eruptive xanthomatosis, which can make hands and feet itch. It's caused by out-of-control diabetes, and it goes away when the disease is managed well. It can also make you itchy on your arms, legs, and buttocks. Other signs of eruptive xanthomatosis: Small, yellow bumps on the skin Redness around the bumps High cholesterol Could It Be Allergies? Your skin can have an allergic reaction to something you touch. The response you see and feel is another type of eczema called allergic contact dermatitis. Symptoms may not appear for a few hours after you touch the item you're allergic to. When they do appear, you may feel itchy and have: Rash Very dry skin Burning and stinging Hives Blisters In general, the answer hinges on what's making your hands and feet itch. Ointments, creams, and lotions can help when dry skin is to blame. If those don't keep you from scratching, talk to your doctor to figure out what's right for you. An allergic reaction may need antihistamines or corticosteroids, whether over-the-counter or prescribed by your doctor. Some products treat scabies by killing the mites on your body. Skin conditions like psoriasis or eczema often require a more detailed treatment plan. Whatever the cause, don't just put up with the itch. You're at a greater risk of infection if you scratch too much."
266,"Doctors don't know exactly what causes eczema. The most common type of eczema -- atopic dermatitis -- resembles an allergy. But the skin irritation, which is more often seen in children rather than adults, is not an allergic reaction.  The current thinking is that eczema is caused by a combination of factors that include: Genetics Abnormal function of the immune system Environment Activities that may cause skin to be more sensitive Defects in the skin barrier that allow moisture out and germs in Endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease Here's more detail on what's known about eczema causes: Eczema is not contagious. You or your children can't catch eczema by coming in contact with someone who has it. Eczema runs in families. That suggests a genetic role in eczema's development. A major risk factor is having relatives who have or had: Eczema Asthma Seasonal allergies such as hay fever Doctors also know that a large percentage of children with severe eczema will later develop asthma or other allergies. Mother's age at time of birth. It's not clear why, but children born to older women are more likely to develop eczema than children born to younger women. Role of environment. Children are more likely to develop eczema if they: Are in higher social classes Live in urban areas with higher levels of pollution Live in colder climates Eczema is not an allergic reaction. Even so, a large number of children who have eczema also have food allergies. That doesn't mean that certain foods such as dairy, eggs, and nuts -- common food allergy triggers in children with eczema -- cause it or make it worse. Before removing particular foods from your child's diet, talk with your health care provider to be sure your child's nutritional needs will be met. A trigger is not something that causes eczema. But it can cause it to flare or make a flare worse. The most common triggers are substances that irritate the skin. For instance, in many people with eczema, wool or man-made fibers that come in contact with the skin can trigger a flare. Examples of other things that can irritate the skin include: Soaps and cleansers Perfume Makeup Dust and sand Chlorine Solvents Irritants in the environment Cigarette smoke Flares can also be triggered by certain conditions that have an effect on the immune system. For instance, things that can trigger or worsen a flare include: Cold or flu Bacterial infection Allergic reaction to something such as mold, pollen, or pet dander Stress has also been identified as a possible trigger. Actions and environments that cause the skin to dry out or become otherwise sensitive can trigger flares. Some examples include: Prolonged exposure to water Being too hot or too cold Sweating and then becoming chilled Taking baths or showers that are too hot or last too long Not using a skin lubricant after a bath Low humidity in the winter Living in a climate that is dry year-round"
267,"Asthma is a chronic (long-term, ongoing) disease that causes inflammation of the breathing passages (bronchi) of the lungs. The inflammation irritates the airway, causing breathing problems. Asthma is triggered by external factors or specific situations. When a person with asthma is exposed to one of his or her triggers, the inflammation worsens and symptoms ensue. Most people with asthma have sudden attacks or periods of bothersome or severe symptoms separated by periods of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Occupational asthma is caused by exposure to a trigger in the workplace. The list of known triggers is long and varied, although they are generally substances that are inhaled. Some asthma triggers include: Contaminants in the air such as smoke, chemicals, vapors (gases), fumes, dust, or other particles Respiratory infections, such as colds and flu (viruses) Allergens in the air such as molds, animal dander, and pollen Occupational asthma can occur in almost any line of work or any work environment, including offices, stores, hospitals, and medical facilities. Two types of occupational asthma attacks occur. Aggravation of preexisting asthma: This is by far the most common type. Over time, with regular exposure, you develop hypersensitivity to the trigger. With this underlying asthma, continued exposure to the trigger causes attacks. Irritant asthma: Exposure to certain substances or conditions in the workplace irritates the airways, causing immediate symptoms. Although this is not an allergic-type reaction, the irritation may cause allergy-like or asthma-like symptoms. Once the attack is triggered, the airways begin to swell and tighten (bronchospasm) and secrete mucus. The swelling and extra mucus partially block, or obstruct, the airways. This makes it more difficult to push air out of your lungs (exhale). Early recognition and avoidance of the asthma trigger is particularly important in occupational asthma. Because people spend so much time at work, those with occupational asthma tend to have extensive exposure to their trigger by the time the cause of the symptoms is recognized as asthma. The more time you spend exposed to your trigger, the more likely you are to have permanent lung inflammation and airway hypersensitivity. Occupational asthma is the most common work-related lung disease in developed countries. In up to 15% of people with disabling asthma in the United States, the condition is at least partly related to their work."
268,"When something goes wrong with your penis, it can affect your sex life as well as your overall well-being. Some the most common conditions that affect the penis are: Priapism, a persistent, often painful erection that lasts for more than 4 hours Peyronie's disease, a condition in which a plaque, or hard lump, forms in the penis and causes it to bend or curve Balanitis, an inflammation or infection of the head of the penis Phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is so tight that it cannot be pulled back off the head of the penis Paraphimosis, which happens when the foreskin, once retracted, gets stuck behind the head and cannot return to its natural location. It is a medical emergency that can cause serious complications if not treated. Penile cancer, a rare type of cancer that starts in the skin cells of the penis. In many cases, there are treatments. Some conditions can even be prevented with good hygiene. Because some of these conditions are medical emergencies, it's important to know the symptoms and what to do if they happen. Check with your doctor if you have: Pain, swelling, or tenderness in your penis An abnormal discharge Itchy rash, blisters, sores, or small red bumps Blood in your urine or semen An erection that lasts for 4 hours or longer A foreskin that is too tight to move"
269,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA) is a bacterium that causes infections in different parts of the body. It's tougher to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus -- or staph -- because it's resistant to some commonly used antibiotics.  The symptoms of MRSA depend on where you're infected. Most often, it causes mild infections on the skin, like sores, boils, or abscesses. But it can also cause more serious skin infections or infect surgical wounds, the bloodstream, the lungs, or the urinary tract. Though most MRSA infections aren't serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. Because it's hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a ""super bug."" Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Once there, it can cause an infection. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U. S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia. Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph -- like MRSA -- have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it. MRSA was first discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting. Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up. MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA is carried by about 2% of the population (or 2 in 100 people), although most of them aren't infected. There are two different populations of people who get MRSA -- one is in decline -- those who get it in hospitals or other health care environments -- and the other is on the rise -- those who get it in the community. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA. CA- MRSA skin infections have been identified among certain populations that share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in daycare. But more and more CA- MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA- MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people. In a study of Minnesotans published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, the average age of people with MRSA in a hospital or health care facility was 68. But the average age of a person with CA- MRSA was only 23."
270,"Menopause is a normal condition that all women experience as they age. The term ""menopause"" can describe any of the changes a woman goes through either just before or after she stops menstruating, marking the end of her reproductive period. A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also make the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which control menstruation and ovulation. Menopause happens when the ovaries no longer release an egg every month and menstruation stops. Menopause is considered a normal part of aging when it happens after the age of 40. But some women can go through menopause early, either as a result of surgery, such as hysterectomy, or damage to the ovaries, such as from chemotherapy. Menopause that happens before 40, regardless of the cause, is called premature menopause. Natural menopause is not brought on by any type of medical or surgical treatment. The process is gradual and has three stages: Perimenopause . This typically begins several years before menopause, when the ovaries gradually make less estrogen. Perimenopause lasts up until menopause, the point when the ovaries stop releasing eggs. In the last 1 to 2 years of perimenopause, the drop in estrogen quickens. At this stage, many women have menopause symptoms. Menopause. This is the point when it's been a year since a woman last had her last menstrual period. At this stage, the ovaries have stopped releasing eggs and making most of their estrogen. Postmenopause. These are the years after menopause. During this stage, menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes ease for most women. But health risks related to the loss of estrogen rise as the woman ages. Premature menopause can be the result of genetics, autoimmune disorders, or medical procedures. Other conditions that may cause early menopause include: Premature ovarian failure. Normally, the ovaries make both estrogen and progesterone. Changes in the levels of these two hormones happen when the ovaries, for unknown reasons, prematurely stop releasing eggs. When this happens before the age of 40, it's called premature ovarian failure. Unlike premature menopause, premature ovarian failure is not always permanent. Induced menopause. "" Induced"" menopause happens when the ovaries are surgically removed for medical reasons, such as uterine cancer or endometriosis. Induced menopause can also result from damage to the ovaries caused by radiation or chemotherapy. Most women approaching menopause will have hot flashes, a sudden feeling of warmth that spreads over the upper body, often with blushing and some sweating. The severity of hot flashes varies from mild in most women to severe in others. Other common symptoms around the time of menopause include: Irregular or skipped periods Insomnia Mood swings Fatigue Depression Irritability Racing heart Headaches Joint and muscle aches and pains Changes in libido (sex drive) Vaginal dryness Bladder control problems Not all women get all of these symptoms. Either you'll suspect the approach of menopause on your own, or your doctor will, based on symptoms you've told her about. To help figure it out, your doctor can do a certain blood test. It also helps if you keep track of your periods and chart them as they become irregular. Your menstrual pattern will be an added clue to your doctor about whether you're premenopausal. The loss of estrogen linked with menopause has been tied to a number of health problems that become more common as women age. After menopause, women are more likely to have: Osteoporosis Heart disease A poorly working bladder and bowel Greater risk of Alzheimer's disease Poor skin elasticity (increased wrinkling) Poor muscle power and tone Some weakening in vision, such as from cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye) and macular degeneration (breakdown of the tiny spot in the center of the retina that is the center of vision) A number of treatments can help lower risks that are linked with these conditions."
271,"Nicotine is what keeps smokers smoking: It's the chemical found in the leaves of tobacco plants that makes cigarettes so addictive. It's in all cigars, smokeless tobacco (such as chew or snuff), and most electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes. Nicotine gums, patches, and lozenges have it, too. Simply put, nicotine poisoning happens when you have too much of it in your body. The amount that causes overdose depends on things like your body weight and where the nicotine came from. Usually, someone who gets quick, proper care will recover fully. But a severe case of poisoning could have long-lasting effects. The CDC says 50 to 60 milligrams of nicotine is a deadly dose for an adult who weighs about 150 pounds. But some research suggests a lethal amount may be a lot higher. It's not likely you'll overdose on nicotine just from smoking cigarettes. Your body absorbs only about one-tenth of the nicotine in a cigarette, around 1 milligram, when you smoke it. Overdosing from nicotine gum or a patch is rare, but it's possible if you don't follow the instructions carefully. Because kids are smaller, it takes less nicotine to poison them (or pets, for the same reason). There's enough in a cigarette butt to harm your little one if they decide to eat one off the floor, for example. An older child experimenting with chewing tobacco can also overdose. E-cigarettes pose a bigger risk. They use batteries to heat liquid nicotine -- usually in a cartridge or container -- into a gas or vapor so you can inhale it. Swallowing this liquid nicotine can be toxic. It can also be harmful if you spill some on your skin or get a little in your eye. Sometimes it comes in colorful packages or smells like candy, so it's not surprising that kids will drink it. As little as 1 teaspoon of liquid nicotine can be fatal for the average 26-pound toddler. Nicotine poisoning usually happens in two stages. Symptoms typically last an hour or two after a mild overdose and up to 24 hours for severe poisoning. You'll get early symptoms within the first 15 minutes to an hour. Feeling queasy or throwing up Stomachache Mouth watering Quick, heavy breathing Faster heartbeat Higher blood pressure Pale skin Headache Dizzy, off-balance, or confused Late-phase symptoms are more like winding down. They happen 30 minutes to 4 hours later. Diarrhea Shallow breathing Slower heartbeat Lower blood pressure Lethargy Feeling weak, slow reflexes, or unable to control muscles Seizures Call the American Association of Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222 right away if you suspect an overdose or when someone, especially a child: Swallows any type of tobacco or nicotine product Gets liquid nicotine in their eye Spills liquid nicotine on their skin If the person who is poisoned can't wake up, has a hard time breathing, or has a seizure, call 911. Don't try to make someone who's swallowed nicotine throw up or give them antacids to settle their stomach. Do let them drink water. Make sure their airway is clear. They will probably start vomiting on their own. Rinse eyes splashed with nicotine well with a lot of warm water for at least 15 minutes. Where liquid nicotine has gotten onto skin, wash the area well with soap and water (either warm or cool) and rinse for at least 15 minutes. Don't scrub hard, because you don't want to cause a rash, scrape, or cut. The best way, of course, is to simply not have it around. If you're going to smoke or use other nicotine products, take some basic precautions. Don't smoke, chew, or inhale around your kids. Keep your home and car nicotine-free. Store everything -- packs of cigarettes, snuff tubs, nicotine gum -- out of your kids' sight and reach. Lock up liquid nicotine containers, and buy only refills that use child-resistant packaging. Throw away tobacco and e-cigarette items carefully, so kids and pets can't get to them. Never drop a cigarette butt onto the street, for example, or toss products into open trash cans. Add the Poison Control Center's help line number (800-222-1222) to your phone contacts and post it at home for emergencies. It will connect you to your local poison control center anywhere in the U. S."
272,"Your heart is the most important muscle in your body. During your lifetime it will pump enough blood to fill about three supertankers. The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. Although your aorta is a tough, durable workhorse, sometimes its walls can weaken and bulge in what is called an aortic aneurysm. This could cause a leak that spills blood into your body. Some aortic aneurysms burst, some don't. Others force blood flow away from your organs and tissues, causing problems, such as heart attacks, kidney damage, stroke, and even death. There are two locations of aortic aneurysms. One, in the chest, is a thoracic aortic aneurysm. The other is in the abdomen and is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Thoracic aortic aneurysm. Genes play a role in your chances of having an aortic aneurysm in your chest. Conditions that people can be born with that can affect the aorta include a bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and Loeys- Dietz syndrome. Other causes for thoracic aneurysm might include: High blood pressure Infection Plaque buildup in your arteries (atherosclerosis) High cholesterol Sudden traumatic injury You might not know you have a thoracic aortic aneurysm because symptoms often don't show up until the aneurysm becomes large, or bursts. But as it grows, you may notice some signs, including: Chest or back pain Difficulty breathing or swallowing Shortness of breath Coughing Hoarseness Your doctor often can diagnose a thoracic aortic aneurysm with tests such as an X-ray, an echocardiogram, CT scan, or ultrasound. It's also often monitored on an annual basis to assess for growth. Routine screenings, especially for specific genetic conditions, can also help your doctor find out if your chances are higher. If they are, he might prescribe medications to lower your cholesterol and reduce your blood pressure. If your aneurysm becomes a major problem or grows rapidly in size, you might need surgery. Your doctor will replace the damaged section of your aorta with a man-made tube. Once it's in place, the graft will make that section of the aorta stronger. Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This can happen in the portion of your aorta that passes through your abdomen. There are usually no telltale signs to warn you that something is wrong. Still, you might have: Back pain A deep pain on the side of your abdomen A throbbing sensation near your navel If the aneurysm ruptures, you might feel sick to your stomach, or suddenly develop an intense pain in your back or abdomen. You might vomit, become sweaty, or feel dizzy. Doctors don't really know what causes an abdominal aortic aneurysm, although they suspect a few things might play a role: Hardening of the arteries, which doctors also call atherosclerosis Smoking High blood pressure Genetic predisposition Doctors also think the risks increase if you injure yourself, have an infection, or if your blood vessels become inflamed. Genetics also play a role. If the doctor diagnoses you with an abdominal aneurysm, there can be a chance of blood clots. Small clots can form in the area of the aneurysm, break off, and flow to the legs, kidneys, or other organs. As with a thoracic aortic aneurism, your doctor can sometimes detect an abdominal aortic aneurysm during a routine exam. He might suggest an ultrasound screening, too, especially if you are a man from 65 to 75 years old who has ever smoked, or he thinks your chances of getting an aortic aneurysm are high. If he finds a bulge, and it's small, he might want to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't get bigger and become a problem later. If the aneurysm is large, you might need surgery."
273,"If you or a loved has bipolar disorder, you know how important it is to manage mood episodes with bipolar medications and healthy lifestyle habits. But did you also know that certain foods and dietary supplements might play a role in helping -- or hindering -- people with bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that's defined by dramatic or unusual mood episodes of highs and lows. The episodes of mania and depression can range from very mild to extreme in their intensity and severity. With bipolar disorder, mood episodes can come on gradually over many days or even weeks. Or they can come on suddenly, occurring over the course of just a few days. To count as episodes, symptoms must occur as a constellation of features that affects not only mood but also sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior and must last for at least several days, representing a change from your usual self. With bipolar disorder, the person may experience episodes of major depression or instead, extreme elation and excessive energy. The elation is called mania. The mood episodes of bipolar disorder are accompanied by disturbances in thinking, distortions of perception, and impairment in social functioning. Bipolar disorder was once thought to affect about 1% of the population. Some experts now believe it's higher, perhaps affecting 3% to 4% of the population. There are no laboratory tests to diagnose bipolar disorder, and its symptoms can overlap with other psychiatric disorders. As a result, it's often misdiagnosed and undertreated. There is no specific bipolar diet. Nevertheless, it is important to make wise dietary choices that will help you maintain a healthy weight and stay well. These choices include: Avoiding the "" Western"" style diet that's rich in red meats, saturated fats and trans fats, and simple carbohydrates. This eating style is linked to a higher risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Eating less saturated fats and simple carbohydrates can help overall health but does not directly affect the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Eating a balance of protective, nutrient-dense foods. These foods include fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean meats, cold-water fish, eggs, low-fat dairy, soy products, and nuts and seeds. These foods provide the levels of nutrients necessary to maintain good health and prevent disease, in general. Watching caloric intake and exercising regularly to maintain a healthy weight. Some findings show that those with bipolar disorder may have a greater risk for being overweight or obese. Talk to your doctor about ways to avoid weight gain when taking bipolar medications. The American Heart Association ( AHA) recommends eating non-friedfatty fish at least two times a week. Good choices include: Albacore tuna Anchovies Herring Mackerel Salmon Sardines Trout If you do not like fish, you can take an over the counter fish oil supplement, but it is not known if that will have the same positive effect. Fish oil can help keep your heart healthy. But some experts also believe that fish oil might play a role in brain function and behavior. While studies of omega-3 fatty acids for mood symptoms are not conclusive, some experts believe that they may be helpful in some people with bipolar disorder, particularly if they have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease or high triglycerides. Some research suggests that getting more omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil is linked to greater volume in areas of the brain. In particular, these areas are related to mood and behavior. In one study of 75 patients, one of the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids was decreasing depression in bipolar disorder. Still, the overall evidence for benefit of fish oil in bipolar disorder is inconsistent. More studies are needed before fish oil can be recommended as a proven treatment for bipolar disorder. If you're a vegetarian or vegan looking for possible benefits of fish oil, go with nuts. Walnuts, flaxseed, and canola oil contain alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA), which is converted to omega-3 fatty acid in the body. Some general dietary recommendations for treating bipolar disorder include: Getting only moderate amounts of caffeine and not stopping caffeine use abruptly Avoiding high-fat meals to lower the risk for obesity Watching your salt if you have high blood pressure but not skimping on salt if you are being prescribed lithium (low salt intake can cause higher levels of lithium in the blood) Following your doctor's instructions to stay away from foods that may affect your specific bipolar medication, if any In addition, you need to be wary of natural dietary supplements that can cause a drug-herb interaction. Avoiding too much caffeine may be helpful for getting good sleep, which is especially important for people with bipolar disorder. When someone with bipolar disorder is feeling depressed, extra caffeine may temporarily cause a boost in energy, and possibly mood. The problem is that caffeine can disrupt sleep. Caffeine can also cause nervousness, heart palpitations, and headaches, worsen high blood pressure, or cause irritation in the stomach or esophagus in people that have acid reflux. In addition to lowering caffeine, it's important to avoid high-fat meals with some bipolar medications. High-fat meals may delay the time it takes for some bipolar medications to be absorbed into your system. Talk to your doctor about your medications and necessary dietary changes. If you take MAO inhibitors (a certain class of antidepressant that includes phenelzine ( Nardil,) and tranylcypromine ( Parnate), it's important to avoid tyramine-containing foods. These foods can cause severe hypertension in people taking MAO inhibitors. Some foods high in tyramine are: Overly ripe bananas and banana peels Tap beer Fermented cheese Aged meats Some wines, such as Chianti Soy sauce in high quantities Your doctor can give you a list of foods to avoid if you take these drugs. Also, avoid taking natural dietary supplements if you are taking bipolar medications. Supplements such as St. John's wort and SAM-e are touted to treat moderate depression. A few studies show benefit for some people with depression. But these natural therapies can interact with antidepressants and other bipolar medications. Discuss any natural dietary supplement with your doctor to make sure it is safe. Instructions for most psychiatric medications warn users not to drink alcohol, but people with bipolar disorder frequently abuse alcohol and other drugs. The abuse is possibly an attempt to self-medicate or to treat their disturbing mood symptoms, and they may also cause mood symptoms that can mimic those of bipolar disorder. Alcohol is a depressant. That's why many people use it as a tranquilizer at the end of a hard day or as an assist for tense social situations. While some patients stop drinking when they are depressed, it is more common that someone with bipolar disorder drinks during low moods. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, people with bipolar disorder are five times more likely to develop alcohol misuse and dependence than the rest of the population. The link between bipolar disorder and substance abuse is well established. Alcohol is a leading trigger of depressive episodes in many people who are vulnerable to depression or bipolar disorder. Substance use disorders can seriously disrupt efforts to treat bipolar disorder and often may require their own forms of treatment. Be careful. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice with your bipolar medication. Grapefruit juice may increase the blood levels of many psychiatric medications that are used in bipolar disorder. These include some antidepressants - such as fluvoxamine ( Luvox) or sertraline ( Zoloft), the anti-anxiety drug buspirone ( Buspar), certain anticonvulsants - such as carbamazepine ( Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol), some antipsychotics - such as lurasidone ( Latuda), quetiapine ( Seroquel) or ziprasidone Geodon), stimulants - such as dextroamphetamine ( Adderall, Adderall XR, or Dexedrine), and many sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines), such as alprazolam ( Xanax),clonazepam( Klonopin), diazepam ( Valium), and lorazepam ( Ativan), which could cause excessive drowsiness, mental impairment and even toxicity. Each bipolar medication is different. So talk with your doctor or pharmacist before taking the first dose. Some bipolar drugs can be taken with or without food. Others (such as Latuda or Geodon) are better absorbed into your system when taken with food or are less effective if taken with food (such as Saphris). Your doctor or pharmacist can pull the latest recommendations on taking the bipolar medication so you can safely take the medicine and get the full benefit of the drug."
274,"Liposuction is a cosmetic procedure that removes fat that you can't seem to get rid of through diet and exercise. A plastic or dermatologic surgeon usually does the procedure on your hips, belly, thighs, buttocks, back, arms, or face to improve their shape. But liposuction can also be done with other plastic surgeries, including facelifts, breast reductions, and tummy tucks. You'll want to have realistic expectations. Liposuction won't get rid of cellulite, so if you hoped you'd come out of surgery without any, you're out of luck. Liposuction is a surgical procedure, and with it comes risks. So you need to be in good health before you get it. That means you must at least: Be within 30% of your ideal weight Have firm, elastic skin Not smoke Doctors don't recommend the procedure if you have health problems with blood flow or have heart disease, diabetes, or a weak immune system. The first step is to consult with your surgeon. Talk about your goals, the options, the risks and benefits, and the costs. Ask all your questions. If you decide to go ahead with liposuction, your surgeon will give you instructions on how to prepare for it. These may include diet and alcohol restrictions. Tell your surgeon about any allergies you have and any medications you take, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements. She will likely recommend you stop taking certain meds, such as blood thinners and certain painkillers several weeks before surgery. Your liposuction may take place at your doctor's office or a surgery center. Make sure that the place where you're getting it done is accredited, and is known for its professional standards, safety and good results. You'll go home the day of the procedure. Make sure to have someone drive you home afterward. ( If you're having a lot of fat removed, you should get the surgery done in a hospital, where you might stay overnight). Before your liposuction starts, your doctor might mark the areas of your body that will be treated. She may also take photos to use later for before-and-after comparisons. Next you'll get general anesthesia -- which means you will not be awake during the procedure -- or a âlocal,â which means you will be awake but not feel any pain. There are just a few different liposuction techniques. But what they all have in common is the use of a thin tube, called a cannula, connected to a vacuum to suction the fat from your body. Tumescent liposuction is the most common technique. Your surgeon injects a sterile solution into the area where the fat is to be removed. It consists of saline -- which is salt water - along with lidocaine and epinephrine. The solution makes it easier to suction the fat with less blood loss and pain. Ultrasound-assisted liposuction, or UAL, uses sound waves energy under your skin to rupture the cell walls of the fat. This liquefies the fat so it can be suctioned out. Laser-assisted liposuction, or Smart Lipo, uses a laser to produce a burst of energy to liquefy the fat. You might not have to stay in the hospital depending on the type of surgery you had. But you should expect bruising, swelling, and soreness for at least a few weeks. Your surgeon may require you to wear a compression garment for 1 to 2 months after surgery to control swelling. You'll probably also have to take some antibiotics to prevent infection. Most people can return to work within a few days and get back to normal activities within 2 weeks. But every person is different. Ask your plastic surgeon specific questions about what your recovery will be like, including: What medications will I need to take? Will I wear bandages? Will I have stitches, and when will they be removed? When can I exercise again? Do I need to come back for a follow-up visit? Cosmetic surgery is still surgery, so there are some risks. You can help reduce them by making sure it is done only by a specially trained, board-certified cosmetic surgeon. There are several possible risks directly related to liposuction that you still have to consider, including: Bleeding Complications from anesthesia Shock (usually from not getting enough fluid during surgery) Fluid accumulation (pockets of fluid forming under the skin) Infections (strep, staph) Fat embolism (when tiny pieces of fat break away and block blood flow) Burns from instruments Uneven fat removal Reactions to lidocaine Change in skin sensation; numbness Damage to nerves, blood vessels, muscles, lungs, and abdominal organs Another risk is a blood clot in your deep veins. Clots can be very dangerous if they travel to other parts of your body, such as your lungs. The fat cells are removed permanently during liposuction. But you can gain weight back, with new fat cells, which usually go to different areas of your body. To keep your new shape after surgery, follow a diet that includes lots of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. And exercise regularly. Because liposuction is a cosmetic procedure, most health plans don't cover it. Talk to your insurance company and your surgeon about the costs and payment options, as well as who pays if you have any complications."
275,"If you're recovering from depression, you may feel pretty tired. A trip to the gym could seem like the last thing you want to do. But exercise is good for your head, and research backs this up. One study that involved 80 adults with mild to moderate major depression found that three sessions of heart-pumping activity each week for 12 weeks worked about as well as medication in fighting the symptoms of depression. The researchers also found that after 10 months, people who exercised were much less likely to relapse than people who took medicine. The results of another study showed that three to five weekly workouts that got the heart and lungs working harder cut mild to moderate symptoms of the mood disorder nearly in half. You don't have to start by signing up for a triathlon. Take simple steps to get into a new exercise routine. Start slow. If you do too much too fast, you'll probably wind up sore and discouraged. Instead, gradually work your way up. Begin by exercising for a few minutes or more on a few days of the week. Don't do more than that for a week or two. Slowly build up to 30 minutes or more, 5 days a week. Break it up. You don't have to get all of your physical activity in a single stretch or with one type of exercise. Many people prefer to do shorter workouts throughout the day, and they vary the types they do. Three 15-minute walks are as good as one 45-minute walk. Pick something you enjoy. A lot of people choose a sport not because they like it, but because they think it will be good for them. But if you treat exercise like a chore, you probably won't stick with it. Instead, try different activities until you find one or more that excite you. Maybe you can swim in a local pool, use a treadmill in front of the TV in your living room, go for hikes, or take an exercise class, for example. Get moving with other people. Solo workouts are sometimes hard to stick to. If you have a plan to do it with someone else, you might feel more committed. So find an exercise buddy. Make a date to walk with a neighbor at a set time on specific days. Or start up a regular tennis game with a friend. Many people find that structured classes, like aerobics or yoga, also help them stick with a program. Get more everyday physical activity. Work it into your daily routine whenever and wherever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from your workplace, so you can sneak in some extra walking. Stuff your remote control under a couch cushion and get up to change the channel. Over time, good habits like these can make a big difference."
276,"What you eat and drink, as well as the drugs you take, may all have an effect on incontinence symptoms. Use these two charts to learn more about the potential effects of food, drink, and medication on incontinence. Food or Drink Effect on Incontinence What to Do Too much water or other fluid Overfills the bladder. Drink no more than 2 liters (about 2 quarts) of fluid a day. Drink most fluids during the daytime and limit fluids in the evening. Too little fluid Irritates the bladder. Promotes infection. Drink at least 1 liter (about 1 quart) of fluid every day. Alcoholic beverages Causes dehydration by increasing the amount of urine. Interferes with brain's signals to the bladder about when to release urine. Cut down on or eliminate alcohol. Caffeine-containing drinks and foods (such as coffee, tea, colas, or chocolate) Stimulates the bladder. Act as diuretics, producing more urine. Reduce or eliminate caffeine from your diet. Acidic foods and drinks (such as citrus fruits, coffee, tea, and tomatoes) Irritates the bladder. Cut down or avoid these items. Carbonated drinks Irritates sensitive bladders. Use sparingly or not at all. Spicy foods Irritates the bladder. Avoid these foods. Sugar, honey, and artificial sweeteners Irritate the bladder. Limit your use of these foods, if possible. Medicine Effect on Incontinence What to Do High blood pressure medicine (diuretic ''water pills,"" calcium channel blockers, and others) Some increase urine output. Some relax the bladder, allowing urine to escape. Let your doctor know that medication may be making incontinence worse. Ask your doctor if you can adjust the dose or switch to another medication to lower blood pressure. If you cannot switch or adjust medications, ask your doctor about ways to limit the incontinence symptoms. Antidepressants, sedatives, and tranquilizers Some hinder ability of the bladder to contract. Some decrease awareness of the need to urinate. ( Note that some may improve incontinence symptoms.) Ask your doctor about switching to another medication or to another type of therapy to treat depression. Muscle relaxants Relaxes bladder muscles. Use only if necessary. Ask your doctor about steps to limit incontinence side effects. Sleeping pills Reduces awareness that the bladder is full. Explore alternatives to sleeping pills, such as exercising regularly or starting a bedtime ritual. If you suspect that any drugs are making incontinence worse, DO NOT stop taking the medication on your own. Rather, tell your doctor about your concerns. Your doctor may be able to switch or adjust the medication to relieve these incontinence symptoms. In some cases, however, the benefit of the medication may be worth the increase in incontinence symptoms. If so, work with your doctor to find other ways to ease those symptoms."
277,"The itchy, inflamed skin that comes with psoriasis is treatable. Making simple tweaks to your daily routine can promote healing and calm flare-ups. It's one of the most effective yet easiest things you can do for irritated skin. It can help your skin heal and reduce dryness, itching, redness, soreness, and scaling. Choose your moisturizer based on how dry your skin is. Ointments are thick, heavy, and good at locking in moisture. Lotions are thinner and get absorbed more easily. Or, you can pick a cream that falls somewhere in between. Remember, a product doesn't have to be expensive to work well. Look for a fragrance free moisturizer. After your bath or shower is a good time to gently pat on the lotion. Reapply throughout the day and when you change clothes. Use more on cold or dry days. Another way to keep your skin moist is to use a humidifier in your home, especially when the air is hot and dry. If the heat is on, turn on the humidifier. It will help your skin retain moisture better. A daily warm bath using a mild soap can help soothe itchy spots and remove dry skin. Take 15 minutes to soak in the warm water. You might find comfort if you add oil, finely ground oatmeal, Epsom salt, or Dead Sea salt to your bath, but keep the water and soap mild. Hot temperatures and harsh soaps can be hard on skin that's already sensitive. Try not to rub your skin with the towel as you dry off. Gently pat dry instead. The rubbing action can make sores worse and even cause new ones. Follow immediately with a moisturizer. If you don't have time for a bath, you can still put a wet towel or cold compress on the trouble spot. The ultraviolet ( UV) light in sunlight can slow the growth of skin cells, so small doses of sun can be a good way to soothe, improve, and even heal psoriasis lesions. Even indoor light can make a difference. Try to get some sun two or three times a week, and use sunscreen on your healthy skin. Too much sun (or sunburn) raises your risk of skin cancer and may make your outbreaks worse. Talk to your doctor before adding UV therapy to your routine. And schedule regular skin checkups to be sure you're not overdoing it. Studies show that stress can make psoriasis and itching worse. Some people even trace their first outbreak to a very stressful event. You might be able to calm symptoms simply by lowering your anxiety. There are many ways to lower stress. Build a support system of family and friends. Think about what's most important to you and take time for it. Yoga, meditation, and deep breathing help. Even a long walk around the neighborhood might calm you. Other ways to bust stress: Eat healthy. Drink plenty of water. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. These will also help you fight off infections that may trigger flares. Avoid harsh products like lotions with alcohol, deodorant soaps, acids (glycolic, salicylic, and lactic acid), and even some laundry soaps. These can inflame your sensitive skin. Feel the texture of the fabric of the clothes you buy. Make sure they are soft and comfortable. Avoid wool and mohair. They can irritate already inflamed skin. There's no doubt about it: When you itch, you want to scratch. But scratching can tear open your skin, making way for infection-causing germs. It may also make sores appear where there weren't any before. Keep your nails short. and take an antihistamine if you are itchy. And picking at your skin can lead to infection. When you have an urge, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and gently rub on moisturizer instead. Smoking can trigger flares. Talk to your doctor to help you decide the best way to quit. For some, nicotine patches make psoriasis worse. Heavy drinking can also trigger symptoms. It can even be dangerous when combined with some psoriasis drugs. If you drink, keep it moderate -- that's up to 1 drink a day for women or 2 for men."
278,"Older adults and people with chronic diseases are more likely to have problems from the flu. It often leads to a hospital stay, and sometimes it can be fatal. But this condition is easy to prevent, and the proper steps can keep you healthy during flu season. Flu symptoms in older adults are pretty much the same as in other age groups. They may include: Fever Headache Fatigue Aches and pains Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose It's more common in children, but older adults sometimes have stomach symptoms -- like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea -- with this illness. The flu can lead to: Pneumonia Dehydration Worsening of chronic conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and heart disease Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms: You have trouble breathing with the flu. Symptoms don't improve or get worse after 3 or 4 days. After flu symptoms improve, you suddenly develop signs of a more serious problem including nausea, vomiting, high fever, shaking chills, chest pain, or coughing with thick, yellow-green mucus. Yes. The best way to prevent it is to get an annual flu vaccine. Getting the shot is a smart idea. It makes a big difference in hospitalization and death rates among older adults who live at home and those in nursing homes. A high-dose flu vaccine is made just for seniors. It has four times as much active ingredient as a regular flu shot to provide a better immune response in older people. It's recommended for people ages 65 and older, if it's available. Keep in mind that the seasonal flu viruses change each year, so older adults need to get a new flu shot each fall. Also, there are two vaccines to prevent pneumonia. If you're a healthy adult over age 65, the CDC suggests you get both vaccines. The timing and sequence will vary depending on what vaccine you've had before. The CDC offers an online flu shot clinic locator. Flu vaccinations are easier to find than ever. You can get them at walk-in clinics in many pharmacies and grocery stores. That's in addition to local health departments and many doctors' offices. Flu Mist is a nasal spray flu vaccine that contains a live flu virus. It isn't recommended for adults over age 49. Flu season can begin as early as September and last as late as May. Your best bet is to get a flu shot early in the season so your body has a chance to build up immunity to the virus. It takes about 2 weeks for the flu shot to protect you. If you don't get it early, getting a flu shot later still helps. Contact your doctor if you get symptoms. He'll check for complications and suggest treatment. He might prescribe an antiviral medication like oseltamivir ( Tamiflu), peramivir ( Rapivab), or zanamivir ( Relenza). Other ways to treat flu symptoms in older adults include: Get lots of rest. Drink plenty of liquids. Ask the doctor or pharmacist before you take a new over-the-counter cold or flu medicine. He can make sure it won't interfere with prescription drugs or complicate your other medical conditions."
279,"Herpes simplex viruses are categorized into two types: type 1 ( HSV-1 or oral herpes) and type 2 ( HSV-2 or genital herpes). Most commonly, HSV-1 causes sores (sometimes called ""fever blisters"" or ""cold sores"") around the mouth and lips. HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-2. In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum. Although HSV-2 sores may occur in other locations, these sores usually are found below the waist. HSV-1, which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin, can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils. In general, a person can only get HSV-2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread even if sores are not present. Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth. For many people with herpes, attacks (outbreaks) of herpes can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity, medical treatments or sunburn Menstruation Symptoms of HSV typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum. The blisters break, leaving tender sores. Often, the appearance of HSV is typical and no testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If a health care provider is uncertain, HSV can be diagnosed with laboratory tests, including DNA -- or PCR -- tests and virus cultures. Although there is no cure for herpes, treatments can relieve the symptoms. Medication can decrease the pain related to an outbreak and can shorten healing time. They can also decrease the total number of outbreaks. Drugs including Famvir, Valtrex, and Zovirax, are among the medications used to treat the symptoms of herpes. Warm baths and numbing cream may relieve the pain associated with genital sores. Some people experience very mild genital herpes symptoms or no symptoms at all. Frequently, people infected with the virus don't even know they have it. However, when it causes symptoms, it can be described as extremely painful. This is especially true for the first outbreak, which is often the worst. Outbreaks are described as aches or pains in or around the genital area or burning, pain, or difficulty urinating. Some people experience discharge from the vagina or penis. Oral herpes lesions (cold sores) usually cause tingling and burning just prior to the breakout of the blisters. The blisters themselves can also be painful. There is no cure for herpes simplex. Once a person has the virus, it remains in the body. The virus lies inactive in the nerve cells until something triggers it to become active again."
280,"Kombucha is a fizzy, sweet-and-sour drink made with tea. Many people say it helps relieve or prevent a variety of health problems, everything from hair loss to cancer and AIDS. There's little scientific evidence to back up the claims, but some elements of the drink may be good for you. The basic ingredients in kombucha are yeast, sugar, and black tea. The mix is set aside for a week or more. During that time, bacteria and acids form in the drink, as well as a small amount of alcohol. This process is known as fermentation, and it's similar to how cabbage is preserved as sauerkraut or kimchi, or how milk is turned into yogurt. Kombucha has been around for nearly 2,000 years. It was first brewed in China and then spread to Japan and Russia. It became popular in Europe in the early 20th century. Sales in the United States are on the rise because of its reputation as a health and energy drink. Advocates say it helps your digestion, rids your body of toxins, and boosts your energy. It's also said to boost your immune system, help you lose weight, ward off high blood pressure and heart disease, and prevent cancer. But there's not a lot of evidence to support these claims. Kombucha has sugar and caffeine, as well as B vitamins. It also has probiotics -- the âgood bacteriaâ that are considered helpful for your body. Studies in animals show the drink lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels, among other things. But research hasn't shown that it has the same effects in people. Making kombucha involves letting bacteria grow in a liquid you're going to drink. Much of the bacteria are considered probiotics, but if it's not prepared properly, the drink can grow harmful bacteria or mold. Since the mid-1990s, several cases of illness and at least one death in people who drank it have been reported. Ailments included liver problems, lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the body), allergic reactions, and nausea. The nonprofit product research group Consumer Reports advises against drinking it because of the risk of contamination and little proof of benefits. However, the FDA says kombucha is safe when properly prepared. If you're making it at home, experts recommend using glass, stainless steel, or plastic containers. Keep everything sanitary, including the equipment and your hands."
281,"This is a rare tumor that usually grows in the middle of your lower back in your adrenal glands. It is most common in adults ages 30 to 50, but people of all ages can have it. Children make up about 10% of all cases. Few pheochromocytoma tumors spread to other organs. But they can be dangerous and should be treated right away. Your adrenal glands make hormones that control your metabolism, blood pressure, and other important functions. A pheochromocytoma also releases hormones and does so at much higher levels than normal. The hormones made by these tumors cause high blood pressure, which can damage your heart, brain, lungs, and kidneys. Some people with these tumors have high blood pressure all the time. For others, it goes up and down. High blood pressure may be your only symptom. But most people have at least one of the following as well: Constipation Dizziness when standing Nausea Pale skin Racing heartbeat (heart palpitations) Severe headache Stomach, side, or back pain Unusual sweating These symptoms can come on suddenly, like an attack, several times a day. But they also can happen just a few times a month. As the tumor grows, these attacks may become stronger and happen more often. If you or your child has symptoms like these, see a doctor right away. Doctors don't know why most of these tumors form. About 30%, however, seem to run in families. These are more likely to be cancerous than ones that appear randomly. They can spread to other parts of your body, including your liver, lungs, or bones. The tumors are more common in people with inherited disorders or conditions, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type II Von Hippel- Lindau disease Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1) Hereditary paraganglioma syndrome Many people who have pheochromocytoma are never diagnosed because the symptoms are so much like those of other conditions. But there are ways to find out if you have one of the tumors: Blood or urine tests to tell if you have high levels of hormones in your body An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make images of organs and tissues to check for a tumor A CT scan (computed tomography), which puts together several X-rays taken from different angles to see if there's a tumor. If you have a pheochromocytoma, your doctor may recommend tests to see if it was caused by a genetic disorder. This can tell you if you're at risk for more in the future and whether your children and other family members are at higher risk. A parent with a damaged gene has a 50% chance of passing it to his or her child. You'll most likely need surgery to remove the tumor. Your surgeon may be able to do this using tiny cuts instead of one large opening. This is called laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery. It can shorten your recovery time. Before the surgery, you may need to take medication to lower your blood pressure and control an occasional fast heart rate. If you have a tumor in only one adrenal gland, your surgeon will probably remove that whole gland. Your other gland will still make the hormones your body needs. If you have tumors in both glands, your surgeon may remove just the tumors and leave part of the glands. If both glands need to be removed, you can take steroids to help replace the hormones your body won't be able to make anymore. If all goes well with the surgery, chances are good that your symptoms will go away and your blood pressure will return to normal. If your tumor is cancerous, you may also have radiation and chemotherapy to help keep it from growing."
282,"Whether it's sharp and sudden or dull and constant, tooth pain is hard to ignore. The first step toward relief is to find out what's wrong. If your teeth are healthy, a hard outer layer of enamel covers them to protect the nerves inside. The enamel can wear away over time. When the middle layer of your tooth is exposed, anything you eat or drink can reach your nerve endings. You'll feel a couple seconds of pain when something hot or cold hits them. Sweet or acidic foods may bother you, too. Gum disease also can make your teeth sensitive. Your gums shrink away from your teeth and that exposes the roots. You also can damage your gums if you brush too hard. A recent cleaning or a new filling may make you sensitive for a few weeks. Many people feel it after whitening treatments. An old filling that's loose or damaged can cause it, too. Your teeth come under attack every time you eat. Bacteria cling to them until you brush them away. They produce acid, which makes the holes in your enamel called cavities. Or you could have a crack in a tooth that's exposed the sensitive inner layers. Maybe you bit down on a cherry pit or were hit in the face during softball. A cavity or a crack can cause sharp pain along with sensitivity when you bite down. The longer the pain lingers, the more serious the damage is likely to be. If it's deep enough, a cavity or crack can let bacteria into the inner layer, called pulp, of your tooth. The pulp can become infected, and that can lead to a buildup of pus called an abscess. The infection can spread to tissue and bone, too. An abscess causes severe, throbbing pain that doesn't stop. Other symptoms include: Swelling in your gums or face Bad breath Fever Bad taste in your mouth Swollen glands This is a common problem brought on by stress, sleep disorders, or a bite issue. If you grind your teeth while you sleep, it can wear away your enamel and even cause a crack. You may feel dull pain in your teeth or jaw or get headaches. Teething hurts whether you're a baby or an adult. You're likely to feel it when your wisdom teeth start to push through your gums. Food can get stuck under the gum and cause decay and infection. Your teeth may hurt because of an issue somewhere else in your body. That's called referred pain. It can come from: Certain kinds of headaches, like cluster and migraine Clogged or infected sinuses Problems in the joint or muscles that connect your jaw to your skull In rare cases, a heart attack can cause tooth pain. It's also a symptom of certain nerve diseases. Don't put off a trip to the dentist if your teeth hurt. Cavities and cracks get worse over time. If you grind your teeth, your dentist can make a bite guard for you to sleep in. You can manage some problems yourself. Special toothpastes can reduce sensitivity. And you can reverse early gum disease when you brush and floss correctly."
283,"Many treatments can help you feel and function better with ankylosing spondylitis. These include medications to help ease pain and inflammation and surgeries to help you move better. Your goal is to manage your AS so you can live an active life. Your first step to treat AS will be to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). They help relieve your inflammation, pain, stiffness, and swelling. Still, NSAIDs do not treat the problems with your immune system when you have AS. These problems cause damage to your joints and bones. NSAIDs used to treat AS pain and stiffness include: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac Ibuprofen Indomethacin Meloxicam ( Mobic) Naproxen You can get most NSAIDs in generic forms. Some, like ibuprofen and naproxen, are sold over the counter in drugstores. Unfortunately, NSAIDs can break down the barriers that protect your stomach. This can cause an upset stomach and heartburn. In time, NSAIDs can cause ulcers even if you don't have symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine to protect your stomach. Celecoxib is an NSAID that may ease inflammation without hurting your stomach. If NSAIDs don't ease your AS symptoms, your doctor may prescribe stronger drugs called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). They affect your immune system and can help curb inflammation. They may help with the arthritis that can damage your back and other joints. They also may ease symptoms like joint pain and swelling. DMARDs don't work very well for inflammation in the spine. DMARDs used to treat AS include: Methotrexate Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Methotrexate comes in both pills and shots you can give yourself at home. You may take folic acid supplements to help ease side effects like mouth sores or nausea. Methotrexate can affect your liver, so your doctor will test your blood to make sure your liver is healthy. Sulfasalazine is available as pills. You may have side effects like headaches, bloating, nausea, or mouth ulcers. Your doctor will test your blood from time to time to watch for side effects. If you have severe inflammation in a joint (called a flare), your doctor may give you a shot of corticosteroid in that spot. These drugs are also called steroids. A steroid shot may give you short-term relief from pain and swelling in your joint. Your doctor can inject steroids into the joints, including your sacroiliac (where your lower back meets your pelvis), knee, or hip joint. While these can help, you don't want to rely on them as your main treatment. If NSAIDs or DMARDs don't control your AS, your doctor may prescribe drugs called biologics. These drugs aim to fix the problems with your immune system. They target your body's production of specific proteins that cause inflammation. Biologic drugs affect your immune system and can help ease AS symptoms (pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness) as well as inflammation. These drugs may also help protect your joints from damage. You have a higher chance of getting infections like tuberculosis when you take biologics. If you have signs of an infection, such as a fever or congestion, you should tell your doctor. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before you start a biologic drug and while you take it. These drugs also may raise your odds of getting certain types of cancer, but this is rare. Biologic drugs used to treat AS include: Adalimumab ( Humira) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel) Golimumab ( Simponi) Infliximab ( Remicade) Secukinumab ( Cosentyx) There is research going on now to find new treatments for AS. Some studies focus on genes, including HLA- B27, that make you more likely to get the disease. Others focus on proteins that may trigger inflammation. Researchers hope to come up with new drugs to stop AS before it can damage your back and other joints. Treating the causes of your AS inflammation should help ease your pain. Talk with your doctor about specific pain medications, back stretches, and posture exercises."
284," A fever -- also known as a high fever or a high temperature -- is not by itself an illness. It's usually a symptom of an underlying condition, most often an infection. Fever is usually associated with physical discomfort, and most people feel better when a fever is treated. But depending on your age, physical condition, and the underlying cause of your fever, you may or may not require medical treatment for the fever alone. Many experts believe that fever is a natural bodily defense against infection. There are also many non-infectious causes of fever. Fever is generally not considered dangerous, but hyperthermia can cause dangerous rises in body temperature. This can be due to an extreme temperature associated with heat injury such as heat stroke, side effects of certain medications or illicit drugs, and stroke. With hyperthermia, the body is no longer able to control body temperature. In children with fever, accompanying symptoms such as lethargy, fussiness, poor appetite, sore throat, cough, ear pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are important to relay to your doctor. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, if you have an infant younger than 3 months old with a rectal temperature of 100.4 F or above, you should immediately call your doctor or go to an emergency room, because it could be a sign of a potentially life-threatening infection. Also call your doctor or go to the emergency room if any child has a fever above 104 F. High fever can cause seizures in young children. Call your doctor right away if your child has a fever and: Looks very sick Is drowsy or very fussy Has a weakened immune system or other medical problems Has a seizure Has other symptoms such as rash, sore throat, headache, stiff neck, or earache Call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 1 day in a child less than 2 years old or lasts more than 3 days in a child age 2 or older. A part of the brain called the hypothalamus controls body temperature, which usually varies throughout the day from the normal temperature of 98.6 F. In response to an infection, illness, or some other cause, the hypothalamus may reset the body to a higher temperature. Although the most common causes of fever are common infections such as colds and gastroenteritis, other causes include: Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidney Conditions that cause inflammation Side effects of drugs Cancer Vaccines Other causes of fever include: Blood clots Autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease Hormone disorders such as hyperthyroidism Illegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine Although a fever is easy to measure, determining its cause can be hard. Besides a physical exam, your doctor will ask about symptoms and conditions, medications, and if you've recently traveled to areas with infections or have other infection risks. A malaria infection, for example, may be have a fever that typically recurs. Some areas of the U. S. are hotspots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Sometimes, you may have a ""fever of unknown origin."" In such cases, the cause could be an unusual or not obvious condition such as a chronic infection, a connective tissue disorder, cancer, or another problem. Treatments vary depending on the cause of the fever. For example, antibiotics would be used for a bacterial infection such as strep throat. The most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) and naproxen ( Aleve). Children and teens should not take aspirin because it's linked to condition called Reye's syndrome."
285," Many of us may have a panic attack or two during our lives, and the brief episodes don't lead to anything else. But for some people, they happen a lot more. Fortunately, treatment can do a lot to stop them. Doctors generally treat panic attacks by setting people up with psychological therapy, medication, or both. Whichever route you and your doctor take, it will need time to work, so try to be patient. When people follow through with their treatment plan, the overwhelming majority of them find relief and have no permanent problems. The racing heartbeat or other discomforts that go with an attack can resemble other illnesses, such as heart disease. So your doctor will probably start by giving you a complete physical exam. That way, she can make sure that the symptoms aren't coming from a disease you didn't know about. If no medical condition like that shows up, your doctor may send you to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist trained to recognize when someone has been having panic attacks. Your doctor will combine the counselor's input with her own observations to diagnose what's wrong. When someone has attacks repeatedly, doctors call the condition panic disorder. The treatment may begin with âtalk therapy.â You'll sit down with a counselor who can help you understand what panic disorder is and how you can manage it. As your treatment continues, therapy should help you figure out the situations, thoughts, or feelings that cause your attacks. Once you understand what's happening, those triggers have less power to cause trouble. Counseling should also show you that the attacks' physical effects don't actually hurt you. With your therapist, you'll work through your symptoms in a safe, gradual way until they seem less scary. That also can help make the attacks go away. You'll also learn relaxation techniques that can help you handle attacks when they do happen. If you can control your breathing, for instance, that may make a panic attack less severe. It might also make the next one less likely. You have to practice these skills regularly in your daily life to get the benefit. Your doctor may decide that medication should be part of your therapy, to lessen your attacks' physical symptoms. It might be part of the first steps, for instance. She might prescribe: An antidepressant, which is generally the first choice to prevent future panic attacks. An anti-anxiety prescription drug such as a benzodiazepine. For people with substance use disorders, doctors may prescribe other medications. Medicine to even out an irregular heartbeat, if you have one. You and your doctor may have to try more than one medication before finding what works best. Some people do best with more than one type. In addition to your treatment, you may also find that these everyday habits make a difference: Yoga or deep breathing may relax your body and lower stress. Exercise can help calm your mind and offset potential side effects of medication, such as weight gain. Stay away from alcoholic drinks, caffeine, smoking, and recreational drugs, which can trigger attacks. Get enough sleep, so you don't feel draggy during the day. Some research shows that acupuncture, the Chinese technique of inserting thin needles into the body to control the flow of energy, may help. As for dietary supplements, there's not enough research showing that they work to reduce panic attacks. One, called inositol, showed some promise in small studies, but it's too soon to know how well it works. Be sure to check with your doctor before trying any supplements, because they could have side effects or conflict with medication. While you're working to get better, it helps to have people around you to help. If you join a support group, you could draw strength and encouragement from others who face the same challenges. Your loved ones can pitch in, too. Health professionals more and more recommend treatment programs that include spouses, partners, or families. For instance, the people around you can help you practice relaxation techniques or other skills. If you're a friend or family member of someone who's dealing with panic attacks, be patient with them. Never scold or judge. Learn their signs of stress, so you can watch for them and be a calming influence. If your loved one does have a panic attack, stay calm and help them get whatever aid they need. Conquering panic attacks takes time. If you have weekly therapy sessions, you should start to notice results in 10 to 20 weeks. Some studies show improvement after just 12 weeks. After a year, you should feel a huge improvement. It all depends on sticking with the treatment plan that you and your medical team create. Keep your eyes on the goal."
286,"Diabetes and Exercise: Ideas to Get You Moving If you have diabetes, your doctor may have been telling you for ages: You need to exercise more. Staying active helps you control your blood sugar and cuts your odds of heart problems and other health issues diabetes can cause. But knowing that you should exercise doesn't always make it easier to do it. Busy schedules, families, and work can make it hard for anyone to stick to an exercise plan. And diabetes can make it harder. Issues such as nerve damage, eye disease, and fatigue may all make it tough to stay fit. You may also be afraid of your blood sugars dropping too low. Recommended Related to Diabetes 6 Low- Carb Food Makeovers You watch what you eat because of your diabetes, and you know some of your favorite comfort foods can be a problem. You don't have to give them up if you know how to change them. â Many of my clients are reluctant to part with their highly processed favorites because they don't think their cravings can be satisfied with healthy food,â says Cheryl Forberg, RD, chef and nutritionist for NBC's The Biggest Loser. â But it's a misconception that simple, nutritious foods can't be absolutely bursting with... Read the 6 Low- Carb Food Makeovers article > > But you can do it -- even if you've never liked exercise and don't know where to start. These ideas can help you get moving safely, no matter what shape you're in. Diabetes and Exercise: How Much and Why? Experts say people with diabetes should shoot for: 150 minutes or more of aerobic exercise each week. Studies have shown that regular aerobic exercise can make insulin work better and lower blood sugar long-term. And it makes you less likely to have health problems linked to diabetes, like heart disease. Brisk walks, biking, tennis, or anything else that gets your heart rate up is great. 2 to 3 sessions of strength training each week. The more muscle mass you have, the better your body can process blood sugar. Working muscles first use stored sugars and then blood sugars for energy. Muscle also burns more calories than fat. Lifting weights, sit-ups, pushups, and resistance exercises will help. If you haven't been working out, 150 minutes may sound like an awful lot of exercise. Don't let that put you off -- instead, divide it up. It breaks down to 30 minutes, 5 days a week. And you don't have to do the 30 minutes all at once. Exercise for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes at lunch, and 10 minutes in the evening, and you've got 30 minutes total. And if you're just starting out? Any exercise at all is good for you, even if you only do it for 5 or 10 minutes a day. Once you're used to that, slowly increase the time each day. If you have diabetes and haven't been active, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program. Diabetes and Exercise: Ideas to Get You Moving Best Diabetes Exercises Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, just about any activity that gets your heart rate up or builds strength is a good idea. Anything from line dancing to table tennis can work. Here are a few to try. Walk more -- briskly. For most people with diabetes, walking is a great choice. It's easy. You can do it anywhere. You don't need any gear besides a good pair of sneakers. If you have foot problems from diabetes, though, your doctor may advise you to do exercises that get you off your feet. Get off your feet. If you have poor blood flow and nerve damage, opt for low-impact exercises to protect your feet from injury. Swimming and biking are both good choices. Consider tai chi or yoga. Some studies show that both are good ways to lower blood sugar if you have type 2 diabetes. They also help ease stress, expand your muscles' range of motion, and help improve balance, so you are less likely to fall. Be safe when lifting weights. Starting a weight-training program can improve your glucose levels and how you feel. You want your routine to work major muscle groups in your upper and lower body and your core. If you have vision damage or kidney problems from diabetes, though, weightlifting can hurt blood vessels and worsen some conditions. In that case, talk to your doctor before you start lifting weights. Diabetes and Exercise: Ideas to Get You Moving Diabetes and Exercise: Getting Started Start slowly. If you haven't exercised in a while, begin with just 5 to 10 minutes a day. Build up by adding a few minutes or repetitions each week. Add to your daily activity. Exercise doesn't only happen when you're suited up in workout gear. Add a little extra movement during the day when you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park farther away from the grocery store so you have to take more steps to get there. Take a less direct route into the house. Any extra movement counts. Relax, actively. You don't have to choose between exercise and TV. Set up a home treadmill, exercise bike, or exercise mat in front of the TV. Choose a couple of shows that you watch only when you're moving. Or divide watching a movie into 30-minute sessions, working out during each. You'll do most of your 150 minutes of aerobic exercise in just one movie. Multitask. It's not only TV time that can double up as active time. Call a friend or relative when you're on a walk. Save a book or favorite magazine to read while you're on an exercise bike. If you hate exercise, think about why. Write down the five things you think are worst about exercise. Then figure out how to make them better. If you think it's boring or lonely, join a class or go on walks with a friend. If you hate the gym scene, do it at home. If exercise feels too hard, try dropping down to an easier level and build up. Diabetes and Exercise: Ideas to Get You Moving Tips for Moving Safely Take these extra steps to care for your diabetes when you work out. Talk to your doctor before starting an exercise routine. He or she may have some advice about the best approach for you. Hydrate. You lose water when you exercise, and that can upset your blood sugar levels. Make sure to drink water before, during, and after exercise to make up for what you lose. This is even more important if have nerve damage from diabetes. Talk to your doctor about the best fluids to drink while exercising, especially if you take insulin or a drug that can lower your blood sugar. Protect your feet. Nerve damage and blood flow problems from diabetes can lead to foot wounds, so be careful. Get a good pair of sneakers that feels comfortable. Before and after exercise, check your feet for sores, blisters, or other signs of irritation. If you notice any, get treatment right away. Ask your doctor if you should check your blood sugar before, during, or after exercise. Find out how certain exercises, and how long you do them, change your blood sugar. Learn what levels are too low and too high for moving safely. Learn how to treat signs of low blood sugar and what types of snacks to eat to prevent them. Watch the temperature. If it's very hot or cold, watch your blood sugar. Your body uses insulin differently at extreme temperatures. Wear a medical ID tag. Wear a tag like Medic Alert or carry an ID card that says you have diabetes. Keep a snack handy. Have a snack with you in case your blood sugar level drops low while you exercise. Check for ketones. If you have type 1 diabetes, do not exercise if your blood sugar is greater than 250 mg/d L and your ketones are positive. This could mean you have low insulin levels and exercise will raise your blood sugar level. Diabetes and Exercise: Change It Up It happens: You think you've finally found an exercise routine you can stick with forever. At last you'll be in shape, you sigh. Then, a few weeks or months later, the routine fizzles out -- and the yoga mat, squash racquet, or Rollerblades gather dust in the garage. When this happens, don't get down on yourself or give up. If you have diabetes, being active is too important for your health. As soon as you feel yourself getting bored with a routine, try something else. Some people seem wired to jog five times a week for their whole lives, rain or shine. The rest of us aren't. That's nothing to be ashamed of -- you may just need to mix it up sometimes. Try new things to keep moving fun. That could be your key to better health and good diabetes control."
287,"If you or someone you know has cancer, you've probably been scouring anything you can get your hands on to find the best way to beat the disease. It's likely you've seen terms like âpersonalized medicine,â âprecision medicine,â or âtargeted drugs.â What are these things? More importantly, can they help you? Personalized medicine -- also called precision medicine or pharmacogenetics -- is a new way to fight cancer. It uses information about you and your tumor to figure out what's driving the disease and create a plan just for you. For years, cancer treatment was a cookie-cutter process. You'd have surgery to remove a tumor, then chemotherapy or radiation to kill cancer cells. But blasting cancers with chemotherapy or radiation kills healthy cells as well, which can lead to a host of nasty side effects. Now, researchers can examine your cancer cells and learn the order of the genes in their DNA. While most cells in your body have identical genes, the ones in cancer cells have mutations, or changes. This is what allows them to grow into tumors. What's more, your cancer may have different genetic changes than someone else's. Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. This makes the need for personalized medicine even greater. The FDA has approved more than a dozen drugs that target one of these mutations. They include imatinib ( Gleevec), a drug used on chronic myelogenous leukemia, and the breast cancer drug trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Tumor genetics can also tell doctors which drugs won't work. For example, if your colon cancer has a genetic mutation called KRAS, doctors won't give you two common colon cancer drugs because they know they won't work. Many clinical centers do something called tumor profiling. Your doctor takes a look at your tumor's genes. If he thinks your cancer may have specific mutations, he might start you on a specific drug that is tailored for the genetic mutation found in your cancer cells. For instance, if you have breast cancer, a genetic test would tell him if Herceptin might work for you. Profiling can also help if other treatment options, like chemotherapy, haven't worked for you. A genetic mutation might point your medical team toward an unexpected drug, like one originally designed for another type of cancer. The personalized approach works better to shrink tumors -- and save lives -- than traditional treatment. But it isn't always a cure. Tumors can contain cells with different gene mutations, so a targeted therapy designed to pick off cells with one mutation may work on only part of a tumor. The cells that remain may keep growing. Talk to your doctor to find out if this approach could work for you. Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location. They might choose only people with stage IV lung cancer, for instance. But now that there's personalized medicine, researchers need new ways to study how targeted treatments work on a variety of cancers. Basket trials combine folks with many different cancer types into a single âbasketâ and use a precision medicine approach to find treatments that work. So a single trial could include people on many different drugs. The creation of new treatments requires a constant back-and-forth between doctors and scientists. New drugs are made to combat new gene changes. Then, they're tested in the clinic. As tumors change in new ways, more new drugs will become available."
288,"Fact: Carrots are high in vitamin A, a nutrient essential for good vision. Eating carrots will provide you with the small amount of vitamin A needed for good vision, but vitamin A isn't limited to rabbit food; it can also be found in milk, cheese, egg yolk, and liver. Fiction: Sitting closer than necessary to the television may give you a headache, but it will not damage your vision. Children, especially if they're nearsighted, may do this to see the TV more clearly. They may, in fact, need glasses. Fiction: As with sitting too close to the television, you may feel eyestrain or get a headache from reading in the dark, but it will not weaken your eyes. Fiction: Your eyes will not grow weaker as a result of using corrective lenses. Your prescription may change over time due to aging or the presence of disease, but it is not because of your current prescription. Fact: Children are not able to outgrow strabismus -- the medical term for crossed eyes -- on their own but, with help, it can be more easily corrected at a younger age. That's why it is important for your child to have an eye exam early, first when your child is an infant and then again by age two. Fiction: At the very first sign of symptoms, such as blurred vision, eye pain, flashes of light, or sudden onset of floaters in your vision, you should see your doctor. If detected early enough, depending on the cause, there are treatments that can correct, stop, or at least slow down the loss of vision. Fiction: It has been thought that using a nightlight in your child's bedroom may contribute to nearsightedness, however there is not enough evidence to support this claim. Keeping a nightlight on in your baby's room may actually help him or her learn to focus and develop important eye coordination skills when they are awake. Fact: Looking at the sun may not only cause a headache and distort your vision temporarily, but it can also cause permanent damage to your retina -- the back of your eye. Any exposure to sunlight adds to the cumulative effects of ultraviolet radiation on your eyes. UV exposure has been linked to eye disorders such as macular degeneration, solar retinitis, cataracts, pterygia, and corneal dystrophies. The most dangerous time for sun gazing is midday and during a solar eclipse. The brightness of the sun is hidden; but the dangerous invisible rays that permanently burn your eyes are not reduced. Fact: If you use artificial sweeteners, like cyclamates, your eyes may be more sensitive to light. There are other factors that will make your eyes more sensitive to light as well. They include antibiotics, oral contraceptives, high blood pressure drugs, diuretics, and diabetic medications."
289,"Raloxifene ( Evista) belongs to a class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs). It is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to reduce risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk or with osteoporosis. SERMs were developed to reap the benefits of estrogen while avoiding the hormone's potential side effects. Raloxifene, a so-called ''designer'' estrogen, can act like estrogen on bone -- protecting its density -- but as an anti-estrogen on the lining of the uterus. In a three-year study involving some 600 postmenopausal women, raloxifene was found to increase bone density and lower LDL cholesterol, while having no stimulative effect on the uterine lining (which means that it is unlikely to cause uterine cancer). The first SERM to reach the market was tamoxifen, which blocks the stimulative effect of estrogen on breast tissue. Tamoxifen has proven valuable in preventing cancer in the second breast of women who have had cancer in one breast. Because of its anti-estrogen effects, the most common side effects with raloxifene are hot flashes. Conversely, because of its estrogenic effects, raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots, including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) and pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung). Studies show that the risk of blood clots over a five year period is less than 1% for women who did not have a history of blood clots. Patients taking raloxifene should avoid tobacco use and prolonged periods of immobility during travel, when blood clots are more prone to occur. The risk of deep vein thrombosis with raloxifene is probably comparable to that of estrogen, about 2 to 3 times higher than the usual low occurrence rate. Raloxifene also increases the risk of stroke death in women who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Raloxifene decreases the risk of spine fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, But it does not appear to decrease the risk of hip fracture. ( The only agents that are definitely proven to decrease hip fracture risk are bisphosphonates.) Another SERM combination drug, bazedoxifene-conjugated estrogen ( Duavee) is FDA-approved to reduce hot flashes and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women."
290,"Diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease that results from diabetes -- is the number one cause of kidney failure. Almost a third of people with diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy. People with diabetes and kidney disease do worse overall than people with kidney disease alone. This is because people with diabetes tend to have other long-standing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and blood vessel disease (atherosclerosis). People with diabetes also are more likely to have other kidney-related problems, such as bladder infections and nerve damage to the bladder. Kidney disease in type 1 diabetes is slightly different than in type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, kidney disease rarely begins in the first 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, some patients already have kidney disease by the time they are diagnosed with diabetes. There are often no symptoms with early diabetic nephropathy. As the kidney function worsens, symptoms may include: Swelling of the hands, feet, and face Trouble sleeping or concentrating Poor appetite Nausea Weakness Itching (end-stage kidney disease) and extremely dry skin Drowsiness (end-stage kidney disease) Abnormalities in the hearts' regular rhythm, because of increased potassium in the blood Muscle twitching As kidney damage progresses, your kidneys cannot remove the waste from your blood. The waste then builds up in your body and can reach poisonous levels, a condition known as uremia. People with uremia are often confused and occasionally become comatose. Certain blood tests that look for specific blood chemistry can be used to diagnose kidney damage. It also can be detected early by finding protein in the urine. Treatments are available that can help slow progression to kidney failure. That's why you should have your urine tested every year if you have diabetes. Lowering blood pressure and maintaining blood sugar control are absolutely necessary to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Some medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors can help slow down the progression of kidney damage. Although ACE inhibitors -- including ramipril ( Altace), quinapril ( Accupril) , and lisinopril ( Prinivil, Zestril) -- are usually used to treat high blood pressure and other medical problems, they are often given to people with diabetes to prevent complications, even if their blood pressure is normal. If a person has side effects from taking ACE inhibitors, another class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs) can often be given instead. If not treated, the kidneys will continue to fail and larger amounts of proteins can be detected in the urine. Advanced kidney failure requires treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant."
291,"After your lung cancer is diagnosed, the doctor will run tests to find out the size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. Knowing the stage of your disease is crucial because it will help you and your doctor choose the best course of treatment. Here's a look at the options for each stage. Keep in mind that no one can say for sure how your cancer will respond. Every person is different, and so is every cancer. Your doctor will make changes along the way to find what works best. How It's Defined The cancer is only in the lining of your airways. Treatments Surgery: If your health is good overall, surgery is probably all you need. Depending on where the tumor is, your surgeon will suggest one of these procedures: Wedge resection: Cut out the tumor and a small amount of normal lung tissue. Segmental resection (segmentectomy): Take out the part of the lung where the tumor is. Sleeve resection: Remove a lobe of the lung and a part of the airway. Lobectomy: Cut out an entire lobe of the lung. ( The right lung is divided into three lobes; the left lung has two lobes.) Most surgeons prefer this option since it offers the best chance for a cure. Pneumonectomy: Take out the entire lung. This might sound extreme, but you can live a normal life with only one lung. Photodynamic therapy ( PDT): This process uses a drug called a photosensitizer and a certain type of light to create a form of oxygen that kills nearby cells. It can help shrink tumors without the side effects of other drugs. Brachytherapy: This is a form of internal radiation where radioactive material is put into a tumor or into an airway next to a tumor. How It's Defined In stage IA, the tumor is no larger than 3 centimeters (about 1 1/4 inches) across and hasn't spread to any other tissues or lymph nodes. In stage IB, it's no more than 4 centimeters and has spread to the main bronchus of the lung's lining, or both. Treatments Surgery: If you're in good health, surgery may be all you need. Based on the tumor's size and placement and how well your lungs work, your surgeon may suggest one of these procedures. Sleeve resection Segmentectomy or wedge resection (for tumors smaller than 2 centimeters across) Lobectomy Chemotherapy: With any of these surgeries, nearby lymph nodes are also removed to see if the cancer has spread. If your medical team feels your cancer could come back, they'll probably suggest you get chemo after surgery to destroy any leftover cancer cells. You might hear this called adjuvant chemotherapy. You could take a chemo drug by mouth or get it in a vein. Radiation: If you're not healthy enough for surgery, your doctor may go with this therapy. It uses powerful X-rays to kill cancer cells. You may hear the doctor call it external radiation. Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA): This is a procedure where heat produced by radio waves kills cancer cells. How It's Defined The tumor is between 3 and 7 centimeters across, or it has spread to your lymph nodes, or both. Treatments Chemotherapy: Your doctor may want to do chemo (sometimes paired with radiation) before surgery to shrink the tumor. He might call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Even if your doctor doesn't find cancer cells during surgery, he might suggest chemo afterward just in case cancer cells were left behind. Surgery: If you're healthy enough, the doctor will likely recommend one of the following: Lobectomy Sleeve resection Pneumonectomy After surgery, your doctor will check the tissue he removed to see if cancer cells are at the edges. If so, you may need another operation to remove more cancer cells. Radiation: If you're not healthy enough for surgery, you may get radiation instead. How It's Defined Cancer is found in the lung and in the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest. Stage III has three subtypes: How It's Defined If the cancer has spread only to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest where it began, it's called stage IIIA. Treatments Chemotherapy and radiation: If you can stand the side effects, treatment usually starts with chemo. It might be combined with radiation. Surgery: If you're healthy enough and your doctor thinks there's a good chance he can remove any cancer that remains, he may suggest surgery. In some cases, it may be his first choice of treatment. It's often followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiation. The type of surgery depends on the size and location of the tumor, how far the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes, and whether you've had surgery before. How It's Defined The cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the opposite lung or in your neck. These cancers can't be completely removed by surgery. Treatments Chemotherapy with radiation: Again, treatment depends on your overall health and how you can handle the treatments. If you're in fairly good health, chemo and radiation might improve your condition. Radiation or chemotherapy: If you can't handle the combo treatment, you'll probably get radiation therapy alone. Chemo by itself is less common. Clinical trials: These cancers can be difficult to treat, so you may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments. How It's Defined The cancer has spread to both lungs, to fluid in the area surrounding the lungs, or to other organs. Treatments: Chemotherapy and radiation: A cancer that's spread to distant sites in your body can be hard to cure. As long as you're in fairly good health and can handle the side effects, treatments like chemotherapy and radiation can ease your symptoms and help you live longer. Immunotherapy: This involves drugs that help your body's own immune system find and destroy cancer cells. Targeted therapy: A test can tell your doctor if your cancer will respond to one of these new treatments. These drugs only attack cancer cells and do little damage to healthy cells nearby. They don't work for everyone, and some are still in trial phase and not on the market yet. If there's one that might work for you, your doctor can help you find out more about how to get into a clinical trial. Photodynamic therapy: Doctors use light to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Stent: Lung tumors that have grown into an airway can cause trouble breathing or other problems. Your doctor puts a hard silicone or metal tube called a stent into the airway to hold it open."
292,"Heart failure is common in the United States. Nearly 6 million Americans live with it. But there are simple steps you can take to lower your odds of getting the condition. You get heart failure when your heart can't pump enough blood and oxygen to your muscles and organs. Doctors haven't found a cure, but many people with heart failure live active lives. Heart failure usually doesn't sneak up on people, but develops over time and for a number of reasons. It's important to know if you're more likely to get it so you can take the steps to help prevent it. Certain problems can make your heart work harder than it should and weaken the muscle. Some of these are: High blood pressure Diabetes Coronary artery disease Past heart attack Being too overweight Things like drinking too much alcohol, smoking, and using illegal drugs are all known to damage your heart. Some things that raise your chances of heart failure are out of your control, including: Race ( African- Americans are more likely to have heart failure) Heart defects you're born with Age (your odds go up if you're 65 or older) You can lower your odds of getting heart failure. And the earlier you start, the better your chances. You can begin with a few of these simple steps: Stick to a healthy weight. Exercise regularly. Eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit bad fats, added sugars, salt, and alcohol. Don't smoke or use recreational drugs. Reduce your stress. Get enough sleep. If you think you could be likely to have heart failure, talk to your doctor. She may start you on medications to help manage the condition. Just remember, it's never too late to make lifestyle changes that can protect your heart."
293,"Menopause doesn't cause you to gain weight. But because extra pounds can creep on as women age, a spare tire around the middle has often been dubbed the ""meno-pot"" or ""meno-pudge."" Don't ditch your skinny jeans, though -- here's the truth about this ""middle-age spread"" and what you can do about it. Women tend to have more fat during middle age than men do. Even if you don't add pounds, you may find that clothes don't fit because the waist is too tight. What gives? Doctors think several things can work together to explain why weight gain can strike around this time: We burn fat more slowly as we age. All bodies slow down over time. Many women exercise less in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Busy lives and lapsed gym cards mean less muscle and more fat. Falling hormone levels, plus your genes, cause your body to store fat in new places after menopause. You may have once had more padding at the hips. Now there's more at the waist. This can shift your shape from pear-like (wider at hips and thighs) to apple-like (wider at waist and belly). What doesn't add pounds? Hormone levels. There's no proof that menopause hormone therapy can correct the weight gain. But regular exercise -- even something as simple as walking -- can help many symptoms of menopause. Whatever the cause, more menopausal women in the U. S. are overweight than at their normal weight. Those extra pounds come with added health concerns, too. Belly fat is linked to heart problems, stroke, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, and breast and colon cancer. Even when body mass index ( BMI -- a measure of body fat based on height and weight) is normal, a large waist (35 inches or more for women) along with other risks is linked to more chances of getting diabetes in women. Excess weight responds well to some effort. Here's what helps: Eat a bit less. Pounds gained now may be more likely to go right to your middle. Since your goal should be to lessen weight gain overall, eating just 200 fewer calories a day in your 50s can help. Eat healthier. Food choices make a big change. In astudy, women lost weightat menopause by eating a diet with more nutrients and fewer calories. They ditched sugary drinks, fried foods, meats, cheese, and desserts for fish, fruits, and vegetables. Maintain muscle. Regular exercise helps boost your metabolism and burns off what you eat, and helps your body shed fat faster overall. Keeping active adds muscle mass, which also helps prevent weight gain. Walking, jogging, and strength training also help you shed pounds. Manage your menopause symptoms. Hot flashes and poor sleep can raise your stress levels. Stress packs on pounds. Exercise can help. Ask your doctor what else might work for you."
294,"Atherosclerosis is sneaky. It starts early in life and progresses silently. By the time symptoms occur, it's advanced and a serious problem. There are tests for diagnosing atherosclerosis, but none of them are perfect. Some of them even have risk of harm. So testing isn't as simple as you might think. If you're concerned about atherosclerosis, what should you do? What can you expect at the doctor's office if you ask about it? There are three serious diseases caused by atherosclerosis. Each has its own warning signs: Coronary artery disease: The warning sign for atherosclerosis in the heart is chest pain when you're active, or angina. It's often described as tightness and usually goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath or fatigue. Cerebrovascular disease: Often, a transient ischemic attack ( TIA) may happen before a stroke. Difficulty speaking and weakness on one side are symptoms of strokes and TIAs. The difference: In a TIA, the symptoms go away, usually within an hour, and do not leave permanent brain injury. Peripheral arterial disease: You'll have poor circulation in your legs first. Pain in the calf muscles when you walk (your doctor may call it claudication) is the most common symptom. Poor wound healing or fewer pulses in your feet are other signs. It's important to know that by the time symptoms like these show up, you may already have serious blockages. Also, heart attacks and strokes can occur without any warning signs. Diseases caused by atherosclerosis are the most common cause of death in the U. S. The one test that can directly show blocked arteries is called angiography. It's an invasive test: A thin tube is put inside an artery in the leg or arm. It's then threaded through the body's maze of branching arteries. Injected dye shows arteries -- and any blockages -- on a monitor. Angiography does have risk. Serious complications don't occur often, but it's too high a risk for people who probably don't have blockages. Instead, a system was developed to separate people into risk groups. They can then be tested appropriately, according to risk level. Low-risk people get low-risk testing. Angiography is usually for people who already have a strong chance of atherosclerosis. Your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, family history, and medical history will help your doctor determine how likely you are to have it. Once your doctor has identified your risk group, more tests may be needed, such as: Stress test: With medicines or walking on an exercise treadmill, your heart is made to pump almost as hard as it can. That allows your doctor to see what symptoms you may have. If needed, images of the heart or EKGs can show any blockages. Electron beam computed tomography ( EBCT): A special CT scanner ( CAT scan) snaps pictures of the heart. A computer figures out the amount of calcium in your heart's arteries. More calcium can mean more atherosclerosis. Carotid artery ultrasound: The carotid arteries in the neck can be viewed with a risk-free ultrasound test. Atherosclerosis here increases your chance for heart attacks and strokes. Angiography: This test can show a picture of blockages caused by atherosclerosis. It can be done on arteries in your heart, brain, or legs. Because it has some risk, angiography is usually done only on people with symptoms from their atherosclerosis. Typically, this means people with symptoms of blockages, such as chest pain. Even low-risk testing might not be a good idea. The risk isn't the test itself -- it's what it might lead to. Consider this: If you're already low-risk, a positive result on a stress test is probably a false positive, not real atherosclerosis. ( Remember, the test isn't perfect.) You and your doctor may feel the need to get more tests -- maybe even angiography -- exposing you to needless anxiety and risk of complications. It doesn't make sense to wait for symptoms before doing something. The good news is that over 80% of this risk may be avoidable: Eat a diet low in trans fats and high in fiber-rich fruits and vegetables. Stop smoking. Exercise most days. Get your cholesterol and blood pressure checked. Do what you can now to reduce your risk for this common and deadly disease."
295,"Swallowing seems simple, but it's actually pretty complicated. It takes your brain, several nerves and muscles, two muscular valves, and an open, unconstricted esophagus, or swallowing tube to work just right. Your swallowing tract goes from the mouth to the stomach. The act of swallowing normally happens in three phases. In the first phase, food or liquid is contained in the mouth by the tongue and palate (oral cavity). This phase is the only one we can control. The second phase begins when the brain makes the decision to swallow. At this point, a complex series of reflexes begin. The food is thrust from the oral cavity into the throat (pharynx). At the same time, two other things happen: A muscular valve at the bottom of the pharynx opens, allowing food to enter the esophagus, and other muscles close the airway (trachea) to prevent food from entering the airways. This second phase takes less than half a second. The third phase starts when food enters the esophagus. The esophagus, which is about nine inches long, is a muscular tube that produces waves of coordinated contractions (peristalsis). As the esophagus contracts, a muscular valve at the end of the esophagus opens and food is propelled into the stomach. The third phase of swallowing takes six to eight seconds to complete. A wide range of diseases can cause swallowing problems, which your doctor may call ""dysphagia."" These include: Disturbances of the brain such as those caused by Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease) Oral or pharynx muscle dysfunction such as from a stroke Loss of sphincter muscle relaxation (termed ""achalasia"") Esophageal narrowing such as from acid reflux or tumors Under normal circumstances, people rarely choke during a meal. Occasionally, food will stick in the esophagus for a few seconds (especially solid foods), but will pass spontaneously or can be washed down easily with liquids. But there are a number of symptoms that you should get checked for a possible swallowing problem, including: Frequent choking on food Hesitancy in food passage for more than a few seconds Pain when swallowing Recurring pneumonia (an indication that food may be going into the lungs rather than the esophagus) Immediate medical attention is needed when food becomes lodged in the esophagus for more than 15 minutes and doesn't pass spontaneously or with liquids. Some people don't know that they have swallowing problems, because they compensate unconsciously by choosing foods that are easier to eat, or they eat more slowly. However, untreated swallowing problems raises the risk for choking or having large pieces of solid food lodge in the esophagus. If you think you have a swallowing problem, talk to your health care provider. You may get tests such as: Cineradiography: An imaging test in which a camera is used to film internal body structures. During the test, you will be asked to swallow a barium preparation (liquid or other form that lights up under X-ray). An X-ray machine with videotaping capability will be used to view the barium preparations movement through the esophagus. This is often performed under the guidance of a speech pathologist, an expert in swallowing as well as speech. Upper endoscopy: A flexible, narrow tube (endoscope) is passed into the esophagus and projects images of the inside of the pharynx and esophagus on a screen for evaluation. Manometry: This test measures the timing and strength of esophageal contractions and muscular valve relaxation. Impedance and p H test: This test can determine if acid reflux is causing a swallowing problem. Treatment depends on the type of swallowing problem you have. Sometimes, a swallowing problem will resolve itself without treatment. On other occasions, swallowing problems can be managed easily. Complex swallowing problems may require treatment by a specialist or several specialists. If you have a chewing or swallowing problem there are several things you can do to make eating and drinking easier and safer, including: Positioning Sit upright at a 90-degree angle. Tilt your head slightly forward. Remain sitting upright or standing for 15 to 20 minutes after eating a meal. Dining environment Minimize distractions in the area where you eat. Stay focused on the tasks of eating and drinking. Do not talk with food in your mouth. Amount and rate Eat slowly. Cut food into small pieces and chew it thoroughly. Chew food until it becomes liquid in your mouth before swallowing. Do not try to eat more than 1/2 teaspoon of food at a time. Swallowing You may need to swallow two or three times per bite or sip. If food or liquid catches in your throat, cough gently or clear your throat, and swallow again before taking a breath. Repeat if necessary. Concentrate on swallowing frequently. Saliva management Drink plenty of fluids. Periodically suck on Popsicles, ice chips or lemon ice, or drink lemon-flavored water to increase saliva production, which will increase swallowing frequency. Food consistency Minimize or eliminate foods that are tough to chew and eat more soft foods. Puree food in a blender. If thin liquids cause you to cough, thicken them with a liquid thickener (your speech pathologist can recommend one for you). You can also substitute thicker liquids for thin ones, such as nectar for juice and cream soup for plain broth. Taking medications Crush pills and mix them with applesauce or pudding. Ask your pharmacist for his or her recommendations on which pills should not be crushed and which medications can be purchased in a liquid form."
296,"Your doctor may use a handful of tests to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome and rule out other causes of hand and wrist pain. He'll probably start with questions about your medical history. Then he'll do a physical exam of your hands, arms, shoulders, and neck. He'll try to figure out if your pain is due to another condition, like an injury or arthritis. He'll also make sure your daily activities aren't to blame. The doctor may focus on your wrist to see if the area is tender, swollen, warm, or discolored. He'll probably test each finger to see if you've lost any feeling. And he'll check the strength of the muscles in your hand. After that, he may do or order any of the following tests. They'll focus on the median nerve, which runs through your forearm into your hand. When that nerve gets pressed or squeezed through the carpal tunnel, it causes carpal tunnel syndrome. The doctor will tap or press on the median nerve in your wrist with a reflex hammer. If your fingers tingle or if you feel an electric-shock-like sensation, the test is positive. You may have carpal tunnel syndrome. This is also known as the wrist-flexion test. The doctor will tell you to press the backs of your hands and fingers together with your wrists flexed and your fingers pointed down. You'll stay that way for 1-2 minutes. If your fingers tingle or get numb, you have carpal tunnel syndrome. This means you can tell if two objects touching your skin are two distinct points instead of just one. Your doctor may use a gadget called a 2-point disk-criminator, a small, flat, eight-sided tool with needle-like prongs sticking out from all sides. He might do the test several times on each finger. He'll start with two points touching your skin a few centimeters apart and move them closer together until you feel just one point of pressure. The distance at which you can feel only one point will help him figure out nerve function and compression -- two important components of carpal tunnel syndrome. This test provides some of the strongest evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. It measures how fast an electric signal can travel along a nerve or from the nerve to a muscle. The doctor places a small electrode on your skin near your elbow. It sends a mild electrical current down your median nerve. The more time it takes for the current to travel from your elbow to your fingers, the more damage to your median nerve. This works like part two of the nerve conduction velocity test. It measures how well the muscle around your median nerve works. The doctor places a small needle electrode into muscles in your hand and arm that get impulses from the median nerve. The needle sends electric impulses into the muscle. You relax and flex your hand several times. The doctor can tell if your median nerve is damaged or being squeezed. The needles might hurt a little, but it should stop once the doctor takes them out. You may feel twitches or spasms from the electrical current. You could have some bruising where the electrode went in, but that should go away within a few days. Your doctor may order one of these tests to rule out other causes of wrist and hand pain. An X-ray can show arthritis or a broken bone. An ultrasound or MRI will show a swollen or compressed median nerve. They'll also tell the doctor why it is being squeezed, whether from arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or another reason. He might also order lab tests, like blood work, to look for diseases like diabetes that can damage your nerves."
297,"Menopause and weight gain: Do they always go hand in hand? It may seem that way, especially because gaining weight is so common after menopause. About 30% of women ages 50 to 59 are not just overweight, but obese. Here's what you need to know about the risks of weight gain and how exercise can help you lose weight and keep it off after menopause.  Many of the risks of weight gain are well known: high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, to name a few. Extra fat at your waistline raises these risks more. Unfortunately, a bigger waistline is more likely after menopause. If you now have a waist measurement of more than 35 inches, it's time to take steps to reverse this trend. What is it about menopause that makes it so hard to keep off the weight? It's likely a mix of factors related to menopause and aging. The impact of estrogen. In animal studies, estrogen appears to help control body weight. With lower estrogen levels, lab animals tend to eat more and be less physically active. Reduced estrogen may also lower metabolic rate, the rate at which the body converts stored energy into working energy. It's possible the same thing happens with women when estrogen levels drop after menopause. Some evidence suggests that estrogen hormone therapy increases a woman's resting metabolic rate. This might help slow weight gain. Lack of estrogen may also cause the body to use starches and blood sugar less effectively, which would increase fat storage and make it harder to lose weight. Other age-related factors. As women age, many other changes happen that contribute to weight gain. For example: You're less likely to exercise. Sixty percent of adults aren't active enough, and this increases with age. You lose muscle mass, which lowers your resting metabolism, making it easier to gain weight. The rate at which you can use up energy during exercise declines. To use the same energy as in the past and achieve weight loss, you may need to increase the amount of time and intensity you're exercising, no matter what your past activity levels were. The more active you are, the less weight you're likely to gain. A National Institutes of Health review showed that people who did aerobic activities every day for 10 or more minutes had 6 fewer inches around the waistline compared to people who didn't exercise. And exercising while you're in the process of losing weight -- as well as after you've lost it -- may be critical to maintaining weight loss. Exercise has many other perks aside from weight loss, including: Lower risk of osteoporosis Lower risks of metabolic syndrome, heart attack, and other cardiovascular diseases Improved insulin resistance Keeps joints and muscles strong Helps bowels work well Relieves depression and anxiety Improves overall health What types of exercise can best help you lose and maintain weight after menopause? Strength training, or a weight-resistance exercise program, helps build muscle mass and improve metabolism. Strength training also helps you maintain bone mass. Because you lose muscle mass as you age, add strength training to your workouts, if you haven't before. Aim for two or three times a week. Examples of strength training include weight machines, dumbbells, exercise bands, yoga, and gardening. Low-impact aerobics are good for your heart and lungs. Walking, for example, is one of the best choices, because you can do it anywhere, anytime. Other examples of aerobic exercises include swimming, cycling, aerobics, tennis, and dance. Exercise moderately for at least 30 minutes most, if not all, days of the week. Whenever you can, add activity to your day. Wash the car, play hide and seek with your kids or grandchildren, get in a game of ping pong, etc. Before you begin exercising: Talk to your doctor about a new exercise program. Choose activities you enjoy so you'll stick with your workouts. Find an exercise partner to help you stay motivated. Buy supportive shoes -- the right ones for your activity. Pick a start date and start. After you begin exercising: Allow at least 10 minutes to warm up before starting to exercise rigorously. To do this, choose an activity that gently works major muscles. Before you work out, stretch the muscles that will absorb most of the shock of your exercise routine. If you have any new pain while exercising, stop and let your doctor know. Gradually boost the distance, length, or intensity of your workout. Mix it up. Do different exercises to keep from getting bored and to keep your body challenged. For the best fitness results, combine your exercise efforts with good nutrition. Here are just a few tips: Choose whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Stay away from processed foods. Keep a food diary, or explore programs for your computer or apps for your cell phone, to help you watch how many calories you eat. Don't eat too late in the evening. When you eat out, take half the serving home. Eat smaller amounts but more often."
298,"Wash hands with warm, soapy water. With the person's eyes closed, clean the eyelids with diluted baby shampoo, using a clean cotton ball for each eye. Rinse with cool water and pat dry with a clean towel. Repeat this process twice daily. The person should avoid wearing contact lenses until the condition improves. If the person seeks medical help, the health care provider will do an eye exam and may do some tests. Treatment will depend on the cause of inflammation. If infection is the cause, the health care provider will prescribe an antibiotic ointment."
299,"Maybe you notice your knees start to ache when you're out on your morning run. Or perhaps you now get pain and cramps in your hand when you chop vegetables as you prepare dinner. Could it be a sign of osteoarthritis, you wonder? Pain in one or more of your joints is the classic symptom of this condition. Usually it starts to hurt when you use the joint or right after you wake up. The pain also often gets worse at the end of the day. Some other symptoms you may get: Stiffness. You may notice this the most in the morning or after you've been sitting for a while. Hard to move your joint. You may hear your doctor say you have less ""range of motion,"" which means you can't move as much or as easily as before, especially right after resting. Swelling. The area around your joints gets puffy, especially after you use them. You may also notice bumps that form on your joints. Noises. You may hear a crunching sound from pieces of bone rubbing on each other. Locking up. Your joints, especially hips or knees, lock up or buckle under you. You may also lose your balance at times and feel weak in your muscles. There is no single test that tells you that you've got osteoarthritis. Instead, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. He'll also do a physical exam to see how well your joints work and may order an X-ray or another imaging test. See your doctor as soon as you notice unusual symptoms so you can get started on treatment. Your primary care doctor may suggest you see a rheumatologist, an expert in joint health, especially if your arthritis is advanced. When your doctor asks you about your symptoms, he'll look for specific things that point to osteoarthritis, such as: Pain in your knees and hips. Osteoarthritis often attacks these joints, along with your hands and spine. Your shoulder, elbow, wrist, and ankle can also get arthritis, but this is less common. Hurts when you move. Your doctor will want to know if your joint pain gets worse the more you exercise, but better when you rest. More painful at night. He'll ask if your joint pain gets worse in the evening. Stiffness in your joints first thing in the morning. This usually lasts half an hour or less. He'll also ask when you first noticed the problems, how long they've been going on, and if they changed over time. He'll want to know about other medical problems you may have, any illness or accidents that might have caused the pain, medications you take, and if members of your family have osteoarthritis. Your doctor will check how strong your joints are, how well they move, and if there are any bumps or swelling that might suggest a problem. He may poke and prod a little to see if there are any areas that are painful or tender. Sometimes this is enough to make a diagnosis, especially if you're over 45, but there are other tests your doctor may order: X-rays. They can show signs that you've lost cartilage in your joints, although usually the images only pick this up when your osteoarthritis is advanced. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). It can see damage in your cartilage, tendons, and other parts of the joint. Joint aspiration. Your doctor takes fluid out of the joint with a needle. Examining the fluid can tell you if your pain is from a bacterial infection or uric acid crystals (gout). Osteoarthritis can also be mistaken for psoriatic arthritis, an autoimmune disorder that affects some people who have psoriasis. Symptoms can also be confused with gout, hemochromatosis (when your body has too much iron), arthritis caused by an infection, and tendonitis (when a tendon is inflamed). Osteoarthritis symptoms can also sometimes be mixed up with those of rheumatoid arthritis. Both conditions cause joint pain and make it difficult to move, but there are also key differences: Where it hurts. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects many joints at once and usually the same ones on both sides of the body. Osteoarthritis sometimes only happens in one joint. How long you feel stiff. The morning stiffness of rheumatoid arthritis usually lasts longer than 30 minutes. With osteoarthritis, it's 30 minutes or less. When your symptoms act up. Stiff joints are more common in rheumatoid arthritis and get worse after resting. In osteoarthritis, joints feel worse after they've been working. Why it happens. Osteoarthritis is caused by age and overuse, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which means your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your body. This can cause symptoms like fatigue, fever, weight loss, and lack of appetite, along with the joint pain and stiffness. Blood test results. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, blood tests may show antibodies that are not there if you have osteoarthritis."
300,"Your cells contain glutathione, which is a substance made from three amino acids: cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. Glutathione acts as an important antioxidant in your body. That means it helps combat free radicals. These are molecules that can damage your body's cells. Glutathione plays a role in many chemical reactions in your body. It also helps detoxify chemicals, including some that your body creates naturally, as well as pollutants and drugs. Your supply of glutathione seems to decrease as you get older, possibly because your body can't create as much. Lower glutathione levels appear to go hand-in-hand with poorer health. For instance, lower levels may play a role in many conditions that are more likely to develop in older people. Your glutathione levels may also decrease during certain health problems, such as: Cancer HIV/ AIDS Type 2 diabetes Hepatitis Parkinson's disease Some people take glutathione: For its antioxidant power As a detoxification agent To attempt to protect themselves from the harmful effects of radiation and chemotherapy for cancer; there is no evidence that glutathione works in this regard. People also take glutathione to try to treat weakened immune systems or infertility, as well as many other conditions. In a small study (40 subjects), glutathione administered intravenously was found to improve pain-free walking distance. In fact, taking glutathione by mouth does not appear to be an effective way to get it into your body. In one study, giving healthy people 500 milligrams twice a day for a month didn't raise the level of glutathione in their blood. Some other studies looking at its health effects have used it in injection form or as a treatment inhaled into the lungs. Certain other supplements may boost your body's production of glutathione, such as: Curcumin N-acetylcysteine Selenium Silymarin Vitamin C Vitamin E Your body doesn't seem to absorb glutathione well from foods. However, certain foods high in amino acids that contain sulfur may help boost your levels. These include: Unprocessed meat Garlic Broccoli Asparagus Avocados Spinach Side effects. Taking glutathione long-term has been linked to lower zinc levels. Inhaled glutathione may also trigger asthma attacks in people who have asthma. Symptoms may include wheezing. Risks. Avoid taking glutathione if you're sensitive to it. Experts don't know if taking glutathione is safe during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Interactions. Tell your doctor about any supplements you're taking, even if they're natural. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with any medications. Supplements are not regulated by the FDA."
301,"Getting pneumonia after surgery can be quite serious. According to the CDC, studies have suggested that pneumonia acquired in the hospital can be fatal as often as 33% of the time. Your doctor will help advise on ways to protect yourself but here are some steps you can take. Follow your doctor's instructions about not eating or drinking before surgery. Usually, your doctor will tell you not to eat or drink after midnight the night before surgery. You must follow that advice. If you're going under anesthesia and still have food in your stomach, fluid or vomit may back up and get into your lungs. This can lead to one type of pneumonia called aspiration pneumonia. Happily, just following your doctor's advice greatly reduces the risk. Ask everyone -- family, friends, doctors, and nurses -- to wash their hands. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria and some viruses. So you need to make sure that people who touch you aren't transmitting any nasty germs. Ask when you can start moving around. Lying flat on your back for a long time can increase your risk of developing pneumonia. So find out when it's safe for you to start sitting up and walking around. Do breathing exercises. Try taking 10-15 big, deep breaths each hour. You may also use an incentive spirometer to check your lung function. Stop smoking. Quitting smoking has many health advantages, of course. But if you are unable to completely quit, stop for at least a week or two prior to surgery. Giving your lungs a break will make them stronger and lower your risk of pneumonia."
302,"Most kids who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) take medication to manage their symptoms. You may have heard that there are benefits of taking breaks from the medicine. It may be a good idea for some kids, but talk with the doctor about what's right for your child. Keep these things in mind before making the decision. A medication break can ease side effects. A lack of appetite, weight loss, sleep troubles, headaches, and stomach pain are common side effects of ADHD medication. It may boost your child's growth. Some ADHD medications can slow a child's growth in height, especially during the first 2 years of taking it. While height delays are temporary and kids typically catch up later, going off medication may lead to fewer growth delays. It won't hurt your child. Taking a child off ADHD medication may cause their ADHD symptoms to reappear. But it won't make them sick or cause other side effects. It can be a chance to see if other treatments will work alone. For some children, talk therapy or neurofeedback may work as well as medication. If your child isn't taking medication, it's easier to tell if another treatment is working. It can help your doctor find out if your child's symptoms are changing. For many kids, ADHD symptoms (especially hyperactivity) lessen over time. Sometimes they even go away completely. It may be easier to determine how severe her symptoms are when she's not taking medication. It may make your child's ADHD symptoms reappear or get worse. Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention may become problems again within a day or 2 of stopping medication. You'll need to be extra attentive. Medication helps kids with ADHD pay attention during tough tasks like driving. It may even lower the chances that your child will do risky things, like smoke and drink. You should be prepared to watch your child more than usual during a medication break. It might take a while for your child's medication to work again. Some nonstimulant medications take several days or even weeks to work the way they're supposed to. Your child may be ready if: She's been symptom-free for more than a year while on medication. Her symptoms were not a big problem when she forgot a dose or two of medication. She seems to be concentrating better than ever. You should never stop or change your child's medication without talking to her doctor first. It's a good idea to discuss the medication break with her teachers, too. You'll want to make sure they understand what she's going through and will tell you if her behavior changes. Weekends, holidays, summer vacations, and other âslow timesâ are the best time to take a medication break. That way, if your child is struggling with her symptoms, it won't affect her schoolwork. You may also have more time to pay attention to how she's doing and help her. Taking a break from medication isn't the only option. Your doctor may recommend lowering your child's dosage or switching to another medication instead. If you decide that she should take a break from all medications, other treatments, like talk therapy or neurofeedback, can help her manage her symptoms."
303,"In 1940, the lifetime risk of a woman developing breast cancer was 5%, or one in 20. In 2015 (the latest year for which statistics are available), the risk was just over 12% -- or more than one in 8. In many cases, it's not known why a woman gets breast cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. Different cancers have different risk factors. However, having a cancer risk factor, or even several of them, does not necessarily mean that a person will get cancer. Some women with one or more breast cancer risk factors never develop breast cancer, while about half of women with breast cancer have no apparent risk factors. Significantly higher risk History. A woman with a history of cancer in one breast, such as ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) or invasive breast cancer, is three to four times likelier to develop a new breast cancer, unrelated to the first one, in either the other breast or in another part of the same breast. This is different than a recurrence of the previous breast cancer. Age. Your risk for breast cancer increases as you age. About 80% of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year are ages 45 or older, and about 43% are ages 65 or above. Consider this: In women ages 40 to 50, there is a one in 68 risk of developing breast cancer. From ages 50 to 60, that risk increases to one in 42. In the 60 to 70 age group, the risk is one in 28. In women ages 70 and older, one in 26 is at risk of developing the disease. Moderately higher risk Direct family history. Having a mother, sister, or daughter (""first-degree"" relative) who has breast cancer puts a woman at higher risk for the disease. The risk is even greater if this relative developed breast cancer before menopause and had cancer in both breasts. Having one first-degree relative with breast cancer approximately doubles a woman's risk, and having two first-degree relatives triples her risk. Having a male blood relative with breast cancer will also increase a woman's risk of the disease. Genetics. About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary. Carriers of alterations in either of two familial breast cancer genes called BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at higher risk. Women with an inherited alteration in the BRCA1 gene have about a 72% chance of developing breast cancer by age 80, and those with an inherited alteration in the BRCA2 gene have about a 69% chance of developing breast cancer. There are several other types of abnormal genes that increase risk of breast cancer. Breast lesions. A previous breast biopsy result of atypical hyperplasia (lobular or ductal) or lobular carcinoma in situ increases a woman's breast cancer risk by four to five times. Slightly higher risk Distant family history. This refers to breast cancer in second- or third-degree relatives such as aunts, grandmothers, and cousins. Previous abnormal breast biopsy. Women with earlier biopsies showing any of the following have a slight increased risk: fibroadenomas with complex features, hyperplasia without atypia, sclerosing adenosis, and solitary papilloma. Age at childbirth . Having your first child after age 35 or never having children puts you at higher risk. Early menstruation . Longer lifetime exposure to endogenous (your own) estrogen increases your risk, such as starting to menstruate before age 12, starting menopause after age 55, and never having had a pregnancy. Weight . Being overweight (especially in the waist), with excess caloric and fat intake, increases your risk, especially after menopause. Excessive radiation . This is especially true for women who were exposed to a large amount of radiation before age 30 -- usually as treatment for cancers such as lymphoma. Other cancer in the family. If a family member had ovarian cancer under age 50, your risk is increased. Heritage. Female descendants of Eastern and Central European Jews ( Ashkenazi) are at increased risk. Alcohol. Use of alcohol is linked to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Compared with nondrinkers, women who consume one alcoholic drink a day have a very small increase in risk, and those who have 2 to 5 drinks daily have about 1.5 times the risk of women who do not drink. Race. Caucasian women are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer than are African- American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American women. The exception to this is African- American women, who are more likely than Caucasians to have breast cancer under age 40. Hormone Replacement Therapy ( HRT). Long-term use of combined estrogen and progesterone increases the risk of breast cancer. This risk seems to return to that of the general population after discontinuing them for five years or longer. Low risk Less lifetime exposure to endogenous estrogen. Having a pregnancy before age 18, starting menopause early, and having the ovaries removed before age 37 decreases the risk of developing breast cancer. Factors not related to breast cancer Fibrocystic breast changes Multiple pregnancies Coffee or caffeine intake Use of anti-perspirants Wearing underwire bras Using hair dye Having an abortion or miscarriage Using breast implants Scientists are still investigating whether smoking, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and environmental pollution increase breast cancer risk. Some studies have suggested that women who are using birth control pills have a very slight increased risk of developing breast cancer. That risk disappears after stopping them for 10 years or more. Still other studies show no relation. More research is under way to confirm these findings. Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast cancer."
304,"Almost 30% of Americans have some sort of pain in the lower back, and it's a top cause of disability worldwide. Age plays a role, but the causes can include injures, an inactive lifestyle, poor posture, illnesses, and obesity, among many other things. If you're having pain, it's important to figure out why. Your back is at the mercy of bad habits like: Slouching at your desk Lifting and pulling heavy objects with your back rather your legs Being overweight Not exercising enough Smoking Wearing high heels Carrying an overloaded backpack All of these things can lead to lower back pain. You may carry your stress in your back -- the muscles feel like they're in knots. And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious. Falling down, getting into a car accident, or even overdoing it in that pick-up game over the weekend can cause problems you feel in your lower back, like: Spine/vertebral fractures: Your back may have a broken bone if it gets hit hard or you fall from a great height. Sprains and strains: Lifting and twisting at the same time, or swinging a golf club, can pull or tear the ligaments, muscles, and tendons in your back. Spasms: These are muscle contractions, and they hurt. They generally happen when you sprain or strain your lower back. In many cases, the pain happens when parts of the back -- the spine, joints, tissues, muscles, and the discs that cushion the spinal bones (vertebrae) -- are out of sync. If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back. Kidney infections can also cause your back to feel the brunt. Other issues: Low back pain can also happen because of things like: Kidney stones Endometriosis, a buildup of uterine tissue outside the uterus Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread muscle pain"
305,"There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but it can be managed -- and the symptoms of the disease can be relieved or reduced. Treating Parkinson's disease is often a ""team effort"" involving not only your neurologist but also a wide variety of specialists. Your health care team should include: Neurologists Occupational therapists Physical therapists Counselors Social workers Speech therapists Registered dietitians The goals of treatment vary for each person, but in most cases, treatment for Parkinson's disease is designed to: Maintain overall quality of life Improve mobility and function Reduce rigidity Reduce tremor Reverse slowed movements Improve posture, gait, balance, speech, and writing skills Maintain mental sharpness Most people with Parkinson's disease can be treated using prescribed medications. The most commonly prescribed drugs include: Benztropine mesylate ( Cogentin) Entacapone ( Comtan) Dopar Larodopa Levodopa and carbidopa ( Sinemet) Pramipexole ( Mirapex) Rasagiline ( Azilect) Ropinirole Hcl ( Requip) Rotigotine ( Neupro) Safinamide ( Xadago) Tasmar Trihexphenidyl ( Artane) If you react adversely to medications, or if the medications become ineffective, surgery may be advised. Depending upon your needs, medical history, health, and symptoms, one of the following procedures may be considered for Parkinson's disease: Deep brain stimulation Pallidotomy Thalamotomy Gamma knife There are many other procedures being researched. One of the most promising involves the transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons (tissue transplant) into the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. The hope is that these cells will be able to re-grow the damaged dopamine-producing nerve cells. Alternative therapy may also be used to treat Parkinson's disease. The most touted in recent years has been the effect of Vitamin E on reversing the progression of the disease; although, this effect is still being debated by the scientific community. Relaxation and guided imagery have also been suggested to help with stress, depression, and anxiety. Medical studies have shown that relaxation and guided imagery may help slow the progression of symptoms as well as quicken healing time after surgeries or injuries."
306,"There are many ways to keep rosacea under control. Though rosacea can't be cured, treatment can help you control symptoms and prevent them from getting worse. Some things you can do on your own, like avoiding triggers. Other methods include skin creams, medication, and laser treatments. To keep rosacea under control, learn what your triggers are. Use a symptom diary to keep track. When you find a pattern to your rosacea flare-ups, changing habits and lifestyle can prevent problems. Your treatment will depend on the type of rosacea you have. Most of these creams and oral medications help the most in people with papulopustular rosacea. That's where symptoms include small pimples, facial flushing, and tiny red lines on the cheeks. These treatments may still be used in people with other types of rosacea, but they may not help as much. And even if they work and symptoms go away, you might keep taking it to stop further flare-ups. Your doctor may also combine a few drugs or creams. Antibiotics are a common rosacea treatment, but not because bacteria cause rosacea. Instead, antibiotics may help by easing swelling and inflammation and relieving the pimple-like skin problems you may have. Creams and Gels Your doctor might start treatment with a prescription cream or gel you use on your face once or twice a day. These include: Azelaic acid ( Azelex and Finacea) Brimonidine( Mirvaso) Clindamycin ( Cleocin and Clinda Max) Erythromycin ( Erygel) Ivermectin ( Soolantra) Metronidazole ( Metro Cream or Metro Gel) Sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur ( Clenia and Plexion) Tretinoin( Avita, Retin- A), a retinoid, is used in some hard-to-treat cases. These treatments have side effects, like skin irritation. A few are not safe for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Talk to your doctor about any risks. Antibiotic Pills If your rosacea is more serious or doesn't respond to ointments, your doctor might suggest antibiotic pills, though you might keep using skin creams, too. Antibiotic pills may also be used if you have ocular rosacea. Your doctor might try doxycycline( Vibramycin), erythromycin ( ERYC), metronidazole ( Flagyl), or minocycline( Dynacin). Like any medicine, antibiotics can cause side effects. Treatment is typically long-term, often lasting at least 6 months. Other Drugs If these rosacea treatments don't work, your doctor may try other medicines, such as isotretinoin( Absorbica, Amnesteem, Claravis, Myorisan and Zenatane). But because of serious side effects, it's not used often. You can treat dry eyes of ocular rosacea with liquid tears and cleaning your eyelids every day with warm water. You may need to see an eye doctor to prevent problems. Laser treatments can help get rid of visible blood vessels and redness caused by rosacea. Surgery or laser treatments may help people with rhinophyma, a rare form of rosacea that causes the nose to swell and deform. People who have rosacea may be embarrassed about how they look. Some avoid being around other people. And because of symptoms like a red nose and cheeks, people with rosacea are sometimes unjustly thought to be heavy drinkers. If your symptoms are seriously affecting your mood and self-esteem, do something about it. Treatment for your rosacea symptoms is key. You could also ask your doctor about using makeup to hide affected patches of skin. If you're stressed or depressed, you might get help from counseling or medications. Never ignore signs of anxiety or depression. Talk to your doctor right away so that you can get help."
307,"For centuries, parents have been trying to find bedwetting solutions, often in vain. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the fact that many kids who wet the bed feel a deep sense of shame and embarrassment about their problem, which can contribute to low self-esteem. The good news is that there are things you can do as a parent to help minimize the negative emotional effects of bedwetting, also known as eneuresis. Many children wet the bed until they're about 6 years old and then stop, with no need to seek medical treatment. But if your child is older than 6 or if the bedwetting problem is causing you or your child concern, it's a good idea to visit your pediatrician. The doctor can do a series of tests to rule out abnormalities that might be causing the problem, and help put your child's mind at ease about bedwetting. Sometimes, knowing that bedwetting is a medical problem treated by doctors can help alleviate a child's shame or embarrassment. You and your child can discuss that you're going to address bedwetting the same way you would address a sore throat or sprained ankle, for example. Your child may feel like she's doing something wrong if she wets the bed, so you and the doctor can let her know that it's not her fault. It can be useful to explain to children who wet the bed that enuresis is often caused by a slightly delayed development of the bladder and the nerves that interact with it. You can also talk about the fact that many kids who wet the bed sleep so soundly, they fail to wake up when they need to go to the bathroom. Bedwetting isn't something kids talk about with each other, so your child might feel like he's the only kid his age who still wets the bed. Be sure to tell him that millions of children, and teenagers too, regularly wet their beds. In fact, it's quite likely that he knows someone else with a bedwetting problem -- he just doesn't know it. Bedwetting often runs in families, too. Children whose parents did not wet the bed have a 15% chance of being bedwetters, which goes up to 44% if one parent wet the bed and rises all the way to 77% if both parents wet the bed as children. So, if you or your partner wet the bed when you were young, share this information with your child. Telling them you had the same problem can minimize the embarrassment he feels and give him hope that he will get over the problem. Chances are your child is already very upset and ashamed for having wet the bed again last night. And, believe it or not, he didn't do it on purpose. No matter how tempted you are to get mad, it's important for you to stay calm and positive. In fact, punishing your child for wetting the bed can actually make the problem worse, and damage your relationship with your child. One of the best things you can do to help your bedwetting child's self-esteem is to encourage him and give him hope that he'll overcome the problem. Similarly, be sure to give your child accolades for waking up dry whenever it happens. If your child has siblings, be sure they know that teasing about bedwetting is not allowed. Your goal is to have your child get up to use the bathroom in the night if she needs to, so make sure she feels comfortable doing so. It can be helpful to tell her it's OK to go to the bathroom in the night. For children who are afraid of the dark, placing nightlights in the hallway and the bathroom can make it less scary to venture to the bathroom during the night. To help your child get used to using the bathroom in the night, it might be helpful for you to wake her up at first to help instill the habit. Just as you don't want to overemphasize bedwetting, it's important that you don't ignore it entirely, either. It can give you child a sense of empowerment and help with the embarrassment if you encourage him to help you clean up and assist with the laundry when bedwetting does occur, if he's old enough. It may be helpful to layer the bed with sheets and absorbable pads in between layers. Each morning, or in the middle of the night, the child can remove the wet layer and reveal a dry layer underneath. This may minimize laundry and facilitate the chore of making the bed. Many children who wet the bed despair of ever getting over their problem, which can send their self-esteem into a downward spiral. Interestingly, it's not uncommon for children to stop wetting the bed shortly after they visit a specialist and realize there are things that can be done to stop bedwetting. There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope. First, work with your child to create and keep a bedwetting calendar or journal. Your child can recognize dry nights with stars and even come up with different hypotheses to test. For instance, they might decide to test whether limiting soda in the evening helps minimize bedwetting occurrences and keep track of it in their bedwetting journal. You can also encourage your child to visualize his bladder filling up overnight and imagine himself waking up to use the bathroom when he needs to urinate. Working with your child to use a bedwetting alarm -- a device that is worn and makes noise to wake the child when it gets wet -- can also help your child feel like he is doing something to stop wetting the bed. You might want to compare your child's active involvement in addressing bedwetting to something you do for a problem you have, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising to lose weight, or wearing glasses to help you see better."
308,"A bone biopsy is a test that takes a sample of tissue or cells from your bone to check for cancer or other bone diseases. The sample comes from the outer part of your bone. It's different from a marrow biopsy, which takes the cells from deep inside. There are two types: Needle biopsy uses a special needle to remove the sample. Open biopsy removes the piece of bone through an opening in your skin. You'd have this type of biopsy if the doctor needs a larger sample. These tests can show whether you have cancer or another problem. You might get anxious over the thought that you might have cancer or over having the procedure. That's a natural reaction, but it's important to have the test done. It can help your doctor diagnose you and find the right treatment. Your doctor will tell you what to expect during the biopsy. Ask questions about anything you don't understand. You will sign a consent form. This gives the doctor permission to do the test. Before the procedure, let her know if you: Take any medicines or supplements -- even over-the-counter medications Are allergic to pain medicine, latex, or tape Are pregnant Have bleeding problems or take blood thinners You might have blood tests to make sure you're healthy enough for the test. Your doctor will ask you to stop taking blood thinners a few days before the biopsy. Take your other medicines with a sip of water on the morning of the test. Don't eat or drink anything 8 hours beforehand. You'll wear a gown during the test. Take off your jewelry, glasses, and anything that contains metal. A bone biopsy can be done at a hospital or your doctor's office. Before the test, you'll get medicine to prevent pain and help you relax or sleep. During the biopsy, nurses will check your heartbeat and blood pressure. The doctor might use one of these scans to see your bone during the test: CT, or computed tomography. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of your bones. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your bones. You'll get numbing medicine so you won't feel pain. The doctor makes a small cut in the skin over the bone. Then the doctor places the needle into the bone to take out the sample. She uses a very thin one in a fine needle biopsy to remove a small sample of cells or tissue. She uses a larger one to get a bigger piece of bone in a core needle biopsy. You might feel some pressure when the needle goes in and the sample is taken out. A bandage is placed over the area to stop the bleeding. You will get medicine to help you sleep and numb the area where the biopsy will be done. The doctor makes a small cut in your skin over the bone and removes a piece of it. She closes the hole in your skin with stitches or tape strips. Someone will put a bandage on the opening. You will go into a recovery room. The nurses will check your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing. Once you are awake, you will either go home or to a hospital room to stay overnight. Ask a friend or family member to drive you home. You might be groggy after the test. Your doctor will show you how to clean and care for the biopsy area at home. Your stitches will be removed during a follow-up visit. The area where you had the biopsy might be sore for up to a week. Your doctor can give you pain medicine. The sample of bone will go to a lab. A specialist will look at it under a microscope to see whether it shows cancer or something else. It may take up to a week to get the results. Side effects from a needle biopsy include: Bleeding from the biopsy site Infection Nerve or blood vessel damage Bone fracture Call your doctor if you have blood or fluid draining from the biopsy site, warmth or swelling of the area, fever, or pain. A biopsy can find out whether you have a tumor in your bone, and if that tumor is cancer. The doctor who ordered the test will explain what your results mean."
309,"E. coli ( Escherichia coli), is a type of bacteria that normally lives in your intestines. It's also found in the gut of some animals. Most types of E. coli are harmless and even help keep your digestive tract healthy. But some strains can cause diarrhea if you eat contaminated food or drink fouled water. While many of us associate E. coli with food poisoning, you can also get pneumonia and urinary tract infections from different types of the bacteria. In fact, 75% to 95% of urinary tract infections are caused by E. coli. Some versions of E. coli make you sick by making a toxin called Shiga. This toxin damages the lining of your intestine. The strains of E. coli that make the toxin are sometimes called STEC, which is short for â Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.â One especially bad strain, O157: H7, can make you very sick. It causes abdominal cramps, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. It is the leading cause of acute kidney failure in children. It can also cause life-threatening symptoms such as: Adult kidney failure Fever Bleeding Confusion Seizures You should get emergency help if you have any of these symptoms. You can become infected when you swallow even a small amount of E. coli bacteria. Among the ways this can happen: Ground meat: You eat ground meat that carries E. coli, and the meat wasn't cooked enough to kill the bacteria. When meat is processed, sometimes bacteria from the animals' intestines make their way into the meat. This happens more with ground meat because it comes from more than one animal. Untreated milk: You drink unpasteurized milk, which hasn't been heated to kill bacteria. E. coli can get into the milk from the cow's udder or from milking equipment. Vegetables and fruit: You might eat fresh vegetables or fruit that's been tainted by water that has the bacteria. This happens most often when manure from nearby animals mixes with the water supply. Other foods and beverages: You might also get E. coli from unpasteurized fruit juices and yogurt and cheese made from raw milk. Water: You swallow water that contains E. coli, perhaps while swimming in a pool, lake, or pond. Other people: You might get E. coli from another person who has it, such as a child. The bacteria can be passed to you if you clean up after an infected person and then don't wash your hands really well before you touch your mouth. Animals: It can be found at petting zoos or animal exhibits at fairs. You can also contaminate food in your own kitchen if you allow a knife or cutting board that has touched uncooked meat (like chicken) to come into contact with food that will be eaten raw (like a salad). You'll probably start to feel ill 2 to 5 days after you've taken in the E. coli bacteria. The most common symptoms are: Abdominal cramps Diarrhea, which may be bloody Nausea Constant fatigue You may not have a fever. If you do, it may be slight. Healthy people infected with E. coli usually feel better within a week. But some people have a serious complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which affects the kidneys. This is more likely to happen to older people and children. The only way your doctor can know for sure if you have an E. coli infection is to send a sample of your stool to a lab to be analyzed. Fortunately, the infection usually goes away on its own. For some types of E.coli associated with diarrhea, such as the watery travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics can shorten the length of time you have symptoms and might be used in moderately severe cases. But if you have fever or bloody diarrhea or if your doctor suspects Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, antibiotics should not be taken. They can actually increase the production of Shiga toxin and worsen your symptoms. It's important to rest and get plenty of fluids to replace what your body is losing through vomiting or diarrhea. Don't take over-the-counter medications that fight diarrhea. You don't want to slow down your digestive system, because that will delay your body's shedding of the infection. When you start to feel better, stick to low-fiber foods at first such as: Crackers Toast Eggs Rice Dairy products and foods that are high in fat or fiber can make your symptoms worse. One of the most important things you can do to protect yourself and your family against E. coli is wash your hands, particularly in these situations: Before you prepare food Before preparing bottles or food for infants or toddlers Before touching anything, such as a pacifier, that goes into a small child's mouth. After you've used the bathroom or changed a diaper After you've had contact with animals, even your own pets After handling raw meat You can also prevent E. coli infections by being careful about the foods that carry the greatest chance of contamination: Cook hamburgers until they're 160 F inside. Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, and cider. Wash all of your produce before you eat it. Be especially careful to get dirt off leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach. In your kitchen, a couple of simple rules will help keep you safe: Wash: Clean knives, counters, and cutting boards with hot, soapy water after raw meat has touched them. Keep raw and cooked separate: Use different cutting boards for food that you eat raw, such as vegetables and fruit. Don't put cooked meat back on the same plate you used for raw meat without washing the plate first. When you're swimming, try not to swallow the water, whether it's a pool, a lake, or the ocean. It may be tainted."
310,"If you're a woman and you have a lot of hair growing in places where it normally does just for men, like your upper lip, chin, chest, stomach, or back, that's a condition called hirsutism. The hair is often dark and coarse, instead of the light, fine âpeach fuzzâ that covers most of the body. About 5% of women in the U. S. have hirsutism. It's often caused by genes, hormones, or medication. Genes. Sometimes, hirsutism runs in families. If your mother or sisters have it, you're more likely to get it. It's also more common in people from the Middle East, South Asia, and the Mediterranean. Hormones. Many times, the condition is linked to high levels of male hormones (called androgens). It's normal for women's bodies to make these, and low levels don't cause excess hair growth. But when these amounts are too high, they can cause hirsutism and other things, like acne, a deep voice, and small breasts. High levels of male hormones and hirsutism are common in women who have: Polycystic ovary syndrome , which causes small cysts, or fluid-filled sacs, to form on your ovaries. Cushing's syndrome, which you get when you have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol for long periods of time. Tumors in your adrenal glands (which make hormones like cortisol) or your ovaries. Medication. Some drugs can change the hormone levels in your system, so you grow unwanted hair on your face or body. This can happen with: Drugs that have hormones, like anabolic steroids Drugs that spur hair growth, like Rogaine (minoxidil) A drug called Danocrine (danazol) that can help with endometriosis, when the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of the womb If you have more facial or body hair than you want, there are a number of ways you can remove it. Weight loss. If you're overweight and drop pounds, your body should make fewer male hormones, so you should grow less hair on your face or body. Shaving. You can remove unwanted hair easily with a razor or electric shaver. You may need to shave daily to avoid stubble growth. Some people get razor burn from shaving too often, but a soothing cream may help. Tweezing or threading. There are different ways to pluck hair out at the root. You can use tweezers. Or you can hire someone to âthreadâ -- use a long, tight strand to loop around and remove each unwanted hair. These methods can cause pain and redness. Waxing. A quick way to remove lots of unwanted hair by the root is with melted wax. Often you get this done in a salon. Wax is applied to the skin, then removed quickly. It can cause pain and redness. Creams. Some creams have strong chemicals called depilatories. You apply the cream, let it sit for a while, and when you wipe it off, the hair goes with it. They can irritate sensitive skin, so test a small spot before you use one on a large area. Electrolysis. You can remove hair for good with electrolysis, a pricey service that zaps hair at the root with an electric current. After you repeat the process a few times, hair should stop growing in treated areas. Laser Hair Removal. The heat from lasers can remove hair, but you need to repeat the process a few times, and it sometimes grows back. The treatment targets hair at the root, so it's painful and could damage or scar your skin. Medication. Doctors can prescribe drugs that change the way your body grows hair. When you stop using the medication, hair will grow back, though. Birth control pills make the body produce fewer male hormones. With regular use, you should have less hair on your face or body. Anti-androgen blockers help your body make and use fewer male hormones, so you should grow less hair over time. Vaniqa (eflornithine) is a face cream that slows hair growth where you apply it."
311," Cocaine is a highly addictive drug that ups your levels of alertness, attention, and energy. You may hear it called a stimulant. It's made from the coca plant, which is native to South America. It's illegal in the U. S. Other names for it include: Coke Snow Rock Blow Crack It comes in a few different forms. The most common is a fine, white powder. It can also be made into a solid rock crystal. Most cocaine users snort the white powder into their nose. Some rub it onto their gums or dissolve it in water and inject it with a needle. Others heat up the rock crystal and breathe the smoke into their lungs. The drug sends high levels of dopamine, a natural chemical messenger in your body, into the parts of your brain that control pleasure. This buildup causes intense feelings of energy and alertness called a high. Other short-term effects of cocaine may include: Extreme sensitivity to touch, sound, and sight Intense happiness Anger/irritability Paranoid feeling Decreased appetite People who use cocaine often may also have more serious side effects and health problems, like: Headaches Convulsions and seizures Heart disease, heart attack, and stroke Mood problems Sexual trouble Lung damage HIV or hepatitis if you inject it Bowel decay if you swallow it Loss of smell, nosebleeds, runny nose, and trouble swallowing, if you snort it You may have strong cravings for the drug and the high it brings. But the more you use cocaine, the more your brain will adapt to it. You'll need a stronger dose to feel the same high. This can lead to a dangerous addiction or overdose. Stronger, more frequent doses can also cause long-term changes in your brain's chemistry. Your body and mind begin to rely on the drug. This can make it harder for you to think, sleep, and recall things from memory. Your reaction time may be slower. And you're at risk for more heart, stomach, and lung problems. Counseling and other types of therapy are the most common treatments for cocaine addiction. You may need to stay in a rehabilitation center (or rehab). Sessions with a trained therapist can help you make changes to your behavior and thought processes. Medical detox centers can help your body adjust to treatment, but you'll probably have to pay for them out of your own pocket. Most insurers don't cover hospitalization for withdrawal anymore. No medicines are approved to treat cocaine addiction. The most important part of any treatment plan is that you give up the drug right away. Many people who are addicted to cocaine go through a phase called withdrawal when they first do this. Symptoms can include: Depression Anxiety Fatigue Trouble concentrating Increased hunger Cravings for the drug Nightmares Chills, nerve pain, muscle aches A cocaine overdose is more difficult to treat. Physical signs include: Increased sweating, body temperature, or heart rate Trouble breathing Chest pain Nausea or vomiting Confusion, seizures, tremors Watch for these mental signs of overdose, too: Anxiety Panic Paranoia Hallucinations Delirium An overdose often leads to a stroke or heart attack. An ER doctor will test for those conditions and try to treat them first. He may also use medication to treat other complications you have."
312,"Fragile X syndrome affects a child's learning, behavior, appearance, and health. Symptoms can be mild or more severe. Boys often have a more serious form of it than girls. Children who are born with this genetic condition can get special education and therapy to help them learn and develop like other kids. Medicines and other treatments can improve their behavior and physical symptoms. There are several, including: Trouble learning skills like sitting, crawling, or walking Problems with language and speech Hand-flapping and not making eye contact Temper tantrums Poor impulse control Anxiety Extreme sensitivity to light or sound Hyperactivity and trouble paying attention Aggressive and self-destructive behavior in boys Some children with fragile X also have changes to their face and body that can include: A large head A long, narrow face Large ears A large forehead and chin Loose joints Flat feet Enlarged testicles (after puberty) Symptoms are usually milder in girls. While most boys with fragile X have trouble with learning and development, girls usually don't have these issues. Girls with fragile X sometimes have trouble getting pregnant when they grow up. They might also go into menopause earlier than usual. This condition can also cause health problems like: Seizures Hearing problems Vision problems Heart problems The FMR1 gene, which is on the X chromosome, makes a protein called FMR that helps nerve cells talk to one another. A child needs this protein for his brain to develop normally. Children with fragile X make too little or none of it. People with this condition also have more copies than usual of a DNA segment known as CGG. In most people, this segment repeats five to 40 times. In people with fragile X, it repeats more than 200 times. The more times this DNA segment repeats, the more serious the symptoms are. A mother with the FMR1 gene change has a 50% chance of passing it to any of her children. A father can only pass it to his daughters. Boys are more likely to have fragile X than girls, and they have more severe symptoms. This is because girls have two copies of the X chromosome. Even if one X chromosome has the gene change, the other copy can be fine. Boys have one X and one Y chromosome. If the X chromosome has the gene change, they will have symptoms of fragile X syndrome. Some people inherit the fragile X gene without having symptoms. They are called carriers. Carriers can pass the gene change to their children. These tests can be done during pregnancy to see if an unborn baby has fragile X: Amniocentesis -- doctors check a sample of amniotic fluid for the FMR1 gene change Chorionic villus sampling ( CVS) -- doctors test a sample of cells from the placenta to check for the FMR1 gene After the child is born, a blood test can diagnose fragile X syndrome. This test looks for the FMR1 gene change. Babies born with fragile X syndrome don't always show signs of it. The doctor might notice that the baby's head is larger than usual. As the child gets older, learning and behavior problems can start. No medicine can cure fragile X. Treatments can help your child learn more easily and manage problem behaviors. Options include: Special education to help with learning ( IEP and 504 are education plans that guide the school in providing support) Speech and language therapy Occupational therapy to help with daily tasks Behavior therapy Medicines to prevent seizures, manage ADD symptoms like hyperactivity, and treat other behavioral problems The earlier you start treatment, the better. Work with your child's doctor, teachers, and therapists to make a treatment program. Your child might also qualify for free special education services. To learn more about fragile X, join a support group. Or, reach out to an organization like the National Fragile X Foundation for advice and resources."
313,"The ancient Greeks and Romans knew about motion sickness. Even NASA has made note of it. So if you have this common ailment, you're part of a long tradition. There are ways to prevent or treat it to keep your travels or trip to the amusement park a pleasant one. You get motion sickness when there are conflicts among your senses. Say you're on a ride at the fair, and it's spinning you around and upside down. Your eyes see one thing, your muscles feel another, and your inner ears sense something else. Your brain can't take in all those mixed signals. That's why you end up feeling dizzy and sick. Your inner ears, in particular, help control your sense of balance. They are part of a network called the vestibular system. This system includes three pairs of semicircular canals and two sacs, called the saccule and the utricle. They send information about what's going on around you to the brain. The semicircular canals hold a fluid that moves with the turns of your head. The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. They tell the brain whether you're standing up or lying down. Your brain takes in all this data, and it usually comes together and makes sense. But sometimes your brain gets confusing signals. On a flying plane, for example, you feel like you're moving, but your eyes tell your brain that you don't appear to be going anywhere. The opposite is true as well. After a long sea voyage, you can stand still on dry land but still feel like you're moving. The result is the same: motion sickness. Anybody can get motion sickness, but it's most common in children and pregnant women. Unlike a cold, you can't spread it to other people. It's not contagious. Motion sickness can strike quickly and make you break out in a cold sweat and feel like you need to throw up. Other common symptoms include: Dizziness Increase in saliva production Loss of appetite Pale skin In addition, some people get headaches, feel very tired, or have shallow breathing. For most people, symptoms usually don't last long. They often go away once you get used to the situation, whether it's the rocking of a boat or the movement of a train. But there are some simple things you can do if the motion sickness isn't going away on its own: Relax. Find something to focus on, whether it's taking deep breaths or counting backwards from 100. Closing your eyes can help, too. Look at a stable object. If you're on a boat, look at the horizon. If you're in a car, look through the windshield. Avoid alcohol. Eat lightly before travel but don't fast. Breathe fresh air -- and don't smoke. Avoid reading. If you can, get a seat over the wing if you're flying, an upper-deck cabin if you're sailing, or a front-seat spot if you're in a car. Some people feel like they get relief with these: Raw ginger. There's some scientific proof that this root, long used as a folk remedy to fight nausea, is effective. But it may act as a blood thinner. Talk to your doctor first before you use it. Mint. Eating peppermint is thought to calm the body. At the very least, the aroma may soothe you. Acupuncture and acupressure. Some people say that stimulating a certain point just below the wrist helps ease their nausea. If you're still bothered by motion sickness, you can talk to your doctor about these: Dimenhydrinate ( Dramamine). This over-the-counter antihistamine, used to ease allergies, helps with balance, too. The first dose should be taken about an hour before traveling. More doses are taken every 4 to 6 hours. Scopolamine ( Maldemar). This is a prescription medication. Your wear a patch behind the ear. You apply it 4 hours before needed. A dose lasts 3 days. Other drugs include: Cyclizine ( Marezine, Marzine, Emoquil) Meclizine ( Antivert, Bonine) Promethazine ( Phenadoz, Phenergan, Promethegan) All have side effects, including drowsiness and dry mouth. Motion sickness usually goes away once the journey is over. But if you're still dizzy, have a headache, continue to vomit, notice hearing loss or chest pain, call your doctor."
314,"Dandruff is itchy, flaky, and when it settles on your shoulders, you hope no one can see the evidence. Though you may feel like the only one in the room with this scalp problem, it's actually common. For a few flakes here and there, an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo will usually solve your problem. If it doesn't, you might have a severe case causing your scalp to feel raw and crusty. You'll want to take a different approach for stubborn dandruff. You might need to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in hair, skin, and nail problems. The condition causes little white or yellow flakes of dry skin, which rub off easily, to form on your body. The official name is âseborrheic dermatitis.â If it's on a baby's scalp, you might hear it called âcradle cap.â It usually affects your scalp, but it can happen on other parts of your body. You can have it on your forehead, the sides of your nose, your ears, or your chest. Myths about dandruff may lead you to pick the wrong way to get rid of it. For example, if you think of dandruff as a dry scalp problem, you may wash your hair less often to avoid drying out your scalp even more. In reality, not washing enough will only irritate your scalp and lead to more dandruff. Here are some other dandruff myths and facts: Myth: A dry scalp causes dandruff. Fact: The reverse is true. If you have dandruff, it's because your scalp is oily. Yeast that live on your scalp feast on the extra oil and release substances that irritate your skin. The flakes you see are dead skin cells shedding from your scalp. Myth: Dandruff can lead to serious health problems. Fact: It doesn't do that. It also can't make your hair fall out or cause baldness. But it can be itchy, unsightly, and embarrassing. Myth: If you have dandruff, it means you're dirty. Fact: A lot of different things can cause dandruff, and none of them have anything to do with how clean you are. These include: Stress and being tired a lot HIV Stroke Parkinson's disease Epilepsy You're more likely to get dandruff during your teenage years and after age 50. It's also more common during winter when it's cold and dry. The best thing you can do is to wash your hair every day or every other day with an over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoo. Look for ingredients on the label such as: Ketoconazole ( Nizoral A- D) Salicylic acid ( DCL Salicylic Acid Shampoo, Dermasolve, Neutrogena T/ Sal, Selsun Blue Naturals Dandruff Shampoo) Selenium sulfide ( Exsel, Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment Dandruff Shampoo, Selsun Blue) Sulfur ( Some shampoos have sulfur as an ingredient in combination with other active ingredients.) Tar ( Denorex Therapeutic Protection Dandruff Shampoo, Pentrax, Neutrogena T- Gel) Zinc pyrithione ( Everyday Clean Dandruff Shampoo, Head and Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo, Suave Anti- Dandruff Shampoo, Selsun Blue Salon Ultimate Daily Care 2 in 1 Shampoo) How to use these shampoos: Massage a small amount into your scalp, beard, or other affected area. Don't scrub; you'll only irritate your skin more. Leave the shampoo in for 5 to 10 minutes (check the bottle label for exact instructions), then rinse. Try different shampoos until you find one that works for you. Rotate your anti-dandruff shampoo with a regular moisturizing one to avoid getting a dry scalp. If you've tried over-the-counter dandruff shampoos and are still fighting flakes, see a dermatologist. You may need a stronger, prescription-strength shampoo or another treatment. Sometimes even the best anti-dandruff shampoo won't get rid of a stubborn case. Some things your dermatologist might try: She might prescribe a steroid cream that you rub onto the affected area once or twice daily. You may also need an antifungal medicine that you take by mouth or apply to your scalp or skin to get rid of the yeast. You may need to apply an oil-based medicine and leave it on your scalp overnight under a shower cap, if the problem is on your head. Especially stubborn flakes may not be dandruff at all, but another skin condition that looks like it. Other scalp problems that can lead to flaking skin include: Eczema: A group of conditions that irritate your skin and cause a scaly, itchy rash. Psoriasis: A disease that leaves itchy, red, scaly patches on your skin, including your scalp. Rosacea: Redness and irritation that usually affects the face but can also involve your scalp. If your dandruff isn't going away with treatment, or you have scalp problems such as redness, pain, crusting, or pus, call your doctor. You can't cure dandruff, but by finding the right treatment for your case, you can control it and live pretty much flake-free."
315,"Almost all teens get acne. It happens when an oily substance called sebum clogs pores. Pimples usually pop up on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Acne isn't a serious health risk, though severe acne can cause permanent scars. Acne can also damage self-esteem. Acne can appear as one of the following: Whiteheads: White dots that are pores impacted with oil and skin covered by skin layers. Blackheads: Black bumps that are impacted pores in which material pushes out through the follicles. The black color is not from dirt. It may be from bacteria, dead skin cells, and matter that react with oxygen. Papules, pustules or nodules: More serious lesions appearing red and swollen due to inflammation or infection of the tissue around the clogged follicles, which are often painful and feel hard. Cysts: Deep, pus-filled pimples. It is not clear why some people are more prone to acne than others. The exact cause of acne is not known, but hormones called androgens can play a role. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens make the skin's oil glands get larger and make more sebum. Androgens also can increase because of hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills. Genetics may also matter. If your parents had acne, you may have inherited that tendency. Some medications (for example, androgens taken as medicine, epilepsy medication, lithium, and prednisone) can cause acne. Cosmetics that have a greasy consistency may also clog pores. Water-based products are less likely to cause acne than oil-based makeup. Other things that can make acne worse include: Friction caused by leaning on or rubbing the skin; harsh scrubbing Picking or squeezing blemishes Pressure from bike helmets, backpacks, or tight collars Changing hormone levels in adolescent girls and adult women two to seven days before the start of the menstrual period Stress Dermatologists (doctors who specialize in skin problems) often treat acne, particularly in severe cases. Family or general practitioners, pediatricians, or internists can treat milder forms of acne. Treatments may include: Nonprescription (""over the counter"") topical treatments: "" Topical"" means that you put these products on your skin. They're not pills. These include acetic acid, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur. These treatments are available in many forms including gels, lotions, creams, soaps, and pads. When these products are used regularly, they are moderately effective in treating acne. It may take 4-8 weeks for skin to improve. Prescription topical treatments: These include adapalene, antibiotics, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, dapsone, tazarotene, and tretinoin. Prescription oral drug treatments: For people with moderate to severe acne, doctors often prescribe oral antibiotics (pills) in addition to topical medication. Oral antibiotics are thought to help control acne by curbing the growth of bacteria, thereby decreasing inflammation. They are usually taken daily for four to six months and then tapered and discontinued as acne improves. The most potent oral drug, isotretinoin ( Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis, Myorisan and Zenatane), is usually taken once or twice a day for 16 to 20 weeks. It is believed to reduce the size of the oil glands so that much less oil is produced and to help prevent clogged pores. That curbs the growth of acne-causing bacteria. Because of the risk of birth defects, women of childbearing age must not be pregnant and must not become pregnant while taking isotretinoin. In office treatments: Cysts can be treated with a series of intralesional cortisone injections. A red light therapy can be used to decrease inflammation and bacteria on the skin. A salicylic acid peel can be used to unclog the pores. Here are tips that may help control acne. Don't over-wash or use harsh scrubs. Acne is not caused by dirt. Two gentle washings a day is enough. Too much cleaning can leave skin irritated and dry, triggering glands to produce more oil, increasing the likelihood of pimples. Use oil-free or noncomedogenic products (those that won't clog pores) on your face. Don't squeeze or pick blemishes. Popping pimples can drive acne bacteria deeper into the skin. Picking can lead to more inflammation and permanent scarring. Don't let acne define who you are. Do what you can to improve your skin, working with a dermatologist, if necessary, and keep doing the things you enjoy."
316,"Most people easily identify the symptoms of snoring: rough, hoarse, fluttering breathing noises during sleep, which can vary in frequency, pitch, and intensity. You are frequently overly sleepy and tired during the day. You could have obstructive sleep apnea, a serious condition preventing you from getting enough oxygen during sleep. You fall asleep in inappropriate settings, such as at the office or while eating or driving. You could have obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy, a disorder that causes sufferers to fall asleep during normal waking hours. You live with a snorer and notice that his or her snoring is very loud or marked by intervals of no breathing at all. The person may have obstructive sleep apnea, a serious respiratory condition. The purpose of an evaluation for snoring is identifying potential causes of increased upper airway resistance and there are other conditions , besides sleep apnea, which are treatable such as chronic nasal congestion due to rhinitis or sinusitis, deviated nasal septum, or enlarged tonsils."
317,"The first thing to try for knee pain is usually RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation. What if that's not enough to make you feel better? When your pain is severe or you can't move your knee, you should call your doctor. If it's not that bad -- twinges or aches from an old injury, for instance -- you have other options. Some medicines you can get over the counter. Others you'll have to see your doctor for. Whatever you use, make sure you follow the instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions. Acetaminophen treats mild to moderate pain. It's in over 6,000 products, by itself and with other medicines. If you take too much, it can harm your liver. So check the label on everything you take so you don't accidentally overdose. Capsaicin creams, gels, or patches lower the amount of a chemical in your body that sends pain messages to your brain. The product may sting or burn, and you have to put it on your skin regularly so it keeps working. These are called NSAIDs -- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They include: Aspirin Ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) Naproxen ( Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn) Your doctor can prescribe stronger doses than you can get in the store as well as delayed-release and extended-release forms of naproxen. All of these NSAIDs have similar side effects, including a greater chance of a heart attack or stroke. You could get ulcers, bleeding, or holes in your stomach when you take them for too long. Diclofenac, another prescription NSAID, comes in a gel ( Voltaren) and as a liquid ( Pennsaid) that you put on your skin. Your doctor can give you a shot into your knee, after numbing it, to deliver medicine directly to your joint. Corticosteroids aren't the type of steroid that builds muscle. In the best cases, they can lower inflammation and relieve pain for months. You probably won't get more than two or three steroid shots per year. It can take about 2 to 3 days before you feel the effect. Most people can return to work or go home right after they get the shot. Some people get what's called the ""steroid flare,"" a burst of pain in the injection area for up to 48 hours. Hyaluronic acid is similar to the thick fluid that's supposed to lubricate your joint. Some people who got injections of it into their knee were able to move easier and hurt less for as long as 6 months. The downside is that neither of these types of shots will help everyone. They can also cause discolored skin where you got the shot, infection, and weakened tendons, which connect muscles to bones. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees. Occupational therapy shows you how to do everyday movements in a way that's safer for your knee. For some people, complementary medicine, like acupuncture or chondroitin supplements, may help."
318,"Traditionally, people in western Africa have used the bark of the yohimbe tree as an aphrodisiac and to boost general health as well as athletic performance. Now you can get yohimbe bark extract as a dietary supplement that you can buy without a prescription. Its promoters claim it can help erectile dysfunction ( ED), low sex drive in women, and the unwanted sexual side effects of some antidepressant medicines. But the science around modern claims shows mixed results or not enough research. Yohimbe bark extract isn't the same as yohimbine hydrochloride, the prescription treatment for impotence that's been around since the 1930s. So you can't take it instead of the medication, or expect that it will work the same way. Prescription drugs are strictly regulated by the FDA around testing and labeling, and they have to approved before they can be sold. But supplements don't have the same requirements, and they don't need FDA approval before you can buy them. The companies that make and sell them are responsible for their safety and truthful labeling. Researchers analyzed several yohimbe supplements and found that the amount of the key compound, yohimbine, was less than it would be in the tree's bark. They also found that many of the products had things that aren't normally in yohimbe bark. Yohimbe may affect medications you're taking and other supplements. It can make you bleed easier if you're taking a blood thinner, like warfarin ( Coumadin). You shouldn't use yohimbe if you're taking medicine for diabetes, or if you have kidney, liver, or heart problems. Avoid it if you have seizures or a mental illness, including ADHD. Side effects can include: Higher blood pressure and a faster or irregular heartbeat Chest pain Breathing problems Flushed skin or a rash Tremors (rhythmic muscle movements you didn't mean to make) Pain in your genitals A painful erection that won't go away You could: Feel dizzy, nervous, worried, or cranky Get a headache Get an upset stomach or lose your appetite Have trouble sleeping The safest bet is to talk to your doctor before you start taking it."
319,"Inherited metabolic disorders are genetic conditions that result in metabolism problems. Most people with inherited metabolic disorders have a defective gene that results in an enzyme deficiency. There are hundreds of different genetic metabolic disorders, and their symptoms, treatments, and prognoses vary widely.  Metabolism refers to all the chemical reactions taking place in the body to convert or use energy. A few major examples of metabolism include: Breaking down the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food to release energy. Transforming excess nitrogen into waste products excreted in urine. Breaking down or converting chemicals into other substances and transporting them inside cells. Metabolism is an organized but chaotic chemical assembly line. Raw materials, half-finished products, and waste materials are constantly being used, produced, transported, and excreted. The ""workers"" on the assembly line are enzymes and other proteins that make chemical reactions happen. In most inherited metabolic disorders, a single enzyme is either not produced by the body at all or is produced in a form that doesn't work. The missing enzyme is like an absentee worker on the assembly line. Depending on that enzyme's job, its absence means toxic chemicals may build up, or an essential product may not be produced. The code or blueprint to produce an enzyme is usually contained on a pair of genes. Most people with inherited metabolic disorders inherit two defective copies of the gene -- one from each parent. Both parents are ""carriers"" of the bad gene, meaning they carry one defective copy and one normal copy. In the parents, the normal gene copy compensates for the bad copy. Their enzyme levels are usually adequate, so they may have no symptoms of a genetic metabolic disorder. However, the child who inherits two defective gene copies cannot produce enough effective enzyme and develops the genetic metabolic disorder. This form of genetic transmission is called autosomal recessive inheritance. The original cause of most genetic metabolic disorders is a gene mutation that occurred many, many generations ago. The gene mutation is passed along through the generations, ensuring its preservation. Each inherited metabolic disorder is quite rare in the general population. Considered all together, inherited metabolic disorders may affect about 1 in 1,000 to 2,500 newborns. In certain ethnic populations, such as Ashkenazi Jews ( Jews of central and eastern European ancestry), the rate of inherited metabolic disorders is higher. Hundreds of inherited metabolic disorders have been identified, and new ones continue to be discovered. Some of the more common and important genetic metabolic disorders include: Lysosomal storage disorders : Lysosomes are spaces inside cells that break down waste products of metabolism. Various enzyme deficiencies inside lysosomes can result in buildup of toxic substances, causing metabolic disorders including: Hurler syndrome (abnormal bone structure and developmental delay) Niemann- Pick disease (babies develop liver enlargement, difficulty feeding, and nerve damage) Tay- Sachs disease (progressive weakness in a months-old child, progressing to severe nerve damage; the child usually lives only until age 4 or 5) Gaucher disease (bone pain, enlarged liver, and low platelet counts, often mild, in children or adults) Fabry disease (pain in the extremities in childhood, with kidney and heart disease and strokes in adulthood; only males are affected) Krabbe disease (progressive nerve damage, developmental delay in young children; occasionally adults are affected) Galactosemia: Impaired breakdown of the sugar galactose leads to jaundice, vomiting, and liver enlargement after breast or formula feeding by a newborn. Maple syrup urine disease: Deficiency of an enzyme called BCKD causes buildup of amino acids in the body. Nerve damage results, and the urine smells like syrup. Phenylketonuria ( PKU): Deficiency of the enzyme PAH results in high levels of phenylalanine in the blood. Intellectual disability results if the condition is not recognized. Glycogen storage diseases: Problems with sugar storage lead to low blood sugar levels, muscle pain, and weakness. Mitochondrial disorders: Problems inside mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, lead to muscle damage. Friedreich ataxia: Problems related to a protein called frataxin cause nerve damage and often heart problems. Inability to walk usually results by young adulthood. Peroxisomal disorders: Similar to lysosomes, peroxisomes are tiny spaces filled with enzymes inside cells. Poor enzyme function inside peroxisomes can lead to buildup of toxic products of metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders include: Zellweger syndrome (abnormal facial features, enlarged liver, and nerve damage in infants) Adrenoleukodystrophy (symptoms of nerve damage can develop in childhood or early adulthood depending on the form.) Metal metabolism disorders: Levels of trace metals in the blood are controlled by special proteins. Inherited metabolic disorders can result in protein malfunction and toxic accumulation of metal in the body: Wilson disease (toxic copper levels accumulate in the liver, brain, and other organs) Hemochromatosis (the intestines absorb excessive iron, which builds up in the liver, pancreas, joints, and heart, causing damage) Organic acidemias: methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia. Urea cycle disorders: ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and citrullinemia The symptoms of genetic metabolic disorders vary widely depending on the metabolism problem present. Some symptoms of inherited metabolic disorders include: Lethargy Poor appetite Abdominal pain Vomiting Weight loss Jaundice Failure to gain weight or grow Developmental delay Seizures Coma Abnormal odor of urine, breath, sweat, or saliva The symptoms may come on suddenly or progress slowly. Symptoms may be brought on by foods, medications, dehydration, minor illnesses, or other factors. Symptoms appear within a few weeks after birth in many conditions. Other inherited metabolic disorders may take years for symptoms to develop. Inherited metabolic disorders are present at birth, and some are detected by routine screening. All 50 states screen newborns for phenylketonuria ( PKU). Most states also test newborns for galactosemia. However, no state tests babies for all known inherited metabolic disorders. Improved testing technology is leading many states to expand newborn screening for genetic metabolic disorders. The National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resources Center provides information on each state's screening practices. If an inherited metabolic disorder is not detected at birth, it is often not diagnosed until symptoms appear. Once symptoms develop, specific blood or DNA tests are available to diagnose most genetic metabolic disorders. Referral to a specialized center (usually at a university) increases the chances of a correct diagnosis. Limited treatments are available for inherited metabolic disorders. The essential genetic defect causing the condition can't be corrected with current technology. Instead, treatments try to work around the problem with metabolism. Treatments for genetic metabolic disorders follow a few general principles: Reduce or eliminate intake of any food or drug that can't be metabolized properly. Replace the enzyme or other chemical that is missing or inactive, to restore metabolism to as close to normal as possible. Remove toxic products of metabolism that accumulate due to the metabolic disorder. Treatment may include such measures as: Special diets that eliminate certain nutrients Taking enzyme replacements, or other supplements that support metabolism Treating the blood with chemicals to detoxify dangerous metabolic by-products Whenever possible, a person with an inherited metabolic disorder should receive care at a medical center with experience with these rare conditions. Children and adults with inherited metabolic disorders can become quite ill, requiring hospitalization and sometimes life support. Treatment during these episodes focuses on emergency care and improving organ function."
320,"Dental bonding is a procedure in which a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) is applied and hardened with a special light, which ultimately ""bonds"" the material to the tooth to restore or improve a person's smile. Dental bonding is an option that can be considered: To repair decayed teeth (composite resins are used to fill cavities) To repair chipped or cracked teeth To improve the appearance of discolored teeth To close spaces between teeth To make teeth look longer To change the shape of teeth As a cosmetic alternative to amalgam fillings To protect a portion of the tooth's root that has been exposed when gums recede Preparation. Little advance preparation is needed for dental bonding. Anesthesia is often not necessary unless the bonding is being used to fill a decayed tooth, the tooth needs to be drilled to change its shape, or the chip is near the nerve. Your dentist will use a shade guide to select a composite resin color that will closely match the color of your tooth. The bonding process. Next, the surface of the tooth will be roughened and a conditioning liquid applied. These procedures help the bonding material adhere to the tooth. The tooth-colored, putty-like resin is then applied, molded, and smoothed to the desired shape. A bright, usually blue, light, or laser is then used to harden the material. After the material is hardened, your dentist will further trim and shape it, and polish it to match the sheen of the rest of the tooth surface. Time-to-completion. Dental bonding takes about 30 to 60 minutes per tooth to complete. Advantages: Dental bonding is among the easiest and least expensive of cosmetic dental procedures. Unlike veneers and crowns, which are customized tooth coverings that must be manufactured in a lab, bonding usually can be done in one office visit unless several teeth are involved. Another advantage, compared with veneers and crowns, is that the least amount of tooth enamel is removed. Also, unless dental bonding is being performed to fill a cavity, anesthesia is usually not required. Disadvantages: Although the material used in dental bonding is somewhat stain resistant, it does not resist stains as well as crowns. Another disadvantage is that the bonding materials do not last as long nor are as strong as other restorative procedures, such as crowns, veneers, or fillings. Additionally, bonding materials can chip and break off the tooth. Because of some of the limitations of dental bonding, some dentists view it as best suited for small cosmetic changes, for temporary correction of cosmetic defects, and for correction of teeth in areas of very low bite pressure (for example, front teeth). Consult with your dentist about the best cosmetic approach for your particular problem. Bonded teeth do not require special care. Simply follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush teeth at least twice a day, floss at least once a day, rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash once or twice a day, and see your dentist for regular professional check-ups and cleanings. Because bonding material can chip, it is important to avoid such habits as biting fingernails; chewing on pens, ice, or other hard food objects; or using your bonded teeth as an opener. If you do notice any sharp edges on a bonded tooth or if your tooth feels odd when you bite down, call your dentist. The lifespan of bonding materials for the teeth depends on how much bonding was done and your oral habits. Typically, however, bonding material lasts from three years up to about 10 years before needing to be touched up or replaced. Costs of dental bonding may vary depending on where you live. Generally, bonding can range in cost from $100 to $400 per tooth. Check with your dental insurance company to find out if the cost of bonding might be fully or partially covered."
321,"There isn't any single test that can diagnose Crohn's disease. This condition has many symptoms that are the same as those for other health problems. To make a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, your doctor is likely to gather information from multiple sources. You'll probably go through a combination of exams, lab tests, and imaging studies with these goals in mind: Rule out other health problems Make a clear diagnosis of Crohn's disease Find out exactly which part of the digestive tract is affected Your doctor will begin by gathering information about your health and your family health history. She'll do a physical exam and look for symptoms of Crohn's that usually include: Belly pain and cramps Blood in your poop Diarrhea Drainage from a painful sore near your anus Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Mouth sores Urgent bowel movements Weight loss Your doctor may request lab tests in order to look for problems that might be linked to Crohn's disease. These tests check for signs of infection, inflammation, internal bleeding, and low levels of substances such as iron, protein, or minerals. Blood tests may include: Antibody tests: These help doctors tell if you have Crohn's or ulcerative colitis: Anti- Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody test ( ASCA): People with this protein are more likely to have Crohn's. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test (p ANCA): People with this protein are more likely to have ulcerative colitis. Complete blood count ( CBC): It checks for anemia (low numbers of red blood cells) and infection. C-reactive protein: It looks for this protein, which is a sign of inflammation. Electrolyte panel: Your body might be low on minerals like potassium if you have Crohn's-related diarrhea. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: This gauges the amount of inflammation in your system by measuring the amount of time it takes for your blood to fall to the bottom of a special tube. Iron and B12 levels: These can be low if your small intestine isn't absorbing nutrients like it should. Liver function: The disease can affect your liver and bile duct. Crohn's disease may appear anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. X-rays and other images can help identify the severity and location of Crohn's disease. These studies may include the following: Balloon-assisted enteroscopy: There are about 20 feet of small intestines in your body. They curve around and lie on top of one another. This test makes it easier for doctors to look at them. The version most often used for Crohn's is a double-balloon (or double-balloon assisted) test. There's also a version with a single balloon. Both types work like this: The doctor uses a special flexible tube called an endoscope, which has a tiny camera on one end. It has either one or two balloons attached behind it. He'll inflate them and deflate the balloons to move the tube through your intestine. It's a lot like pulling a curtain onto a rod. Barium X-rays and other X-rays: A barium X-ray can show where and how severe Crohn's disease is. It is especially helpful for finding any problems in parts of the small intestine that can't be easily viewed by other techniques. A chalky fluid containing barium is given by mouth or through the rectum. When barium fluid is given by mouth, it is called an upper GI series. When barium fluid is placed in the rectum, it is called a barium enema. The barium fluid flows through your intestines and looks white on X-ray film. This makes it easier to view problem areas. With a barium X-ray, your doctor may be able to see ulcers, narrowed areas of the intestine, abnormal connections between organs, known as fistulae, or other problems. If barium X-rays show some sign of disease, your doctor may request other X-rays or imaging studies. These X-rays can help identify exactly how much of your digestive tract is affected by Crohn's disease. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy: Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy allow your doctor to directly view the large intestine, which is the lower part of the digestive tract. These techniques can often provide the most accurate information about the intestines. They may be better at finding small ulcers or inflammation than other techniques. They can be used to judge the severity of any inflammation. Colonoscopy is the most important tool in diagnosing Crohn's disease. During these procedures, a flexible viewing tube is placed through the anus into the large intestine. An image of the inside of the intestine is often projected onto a video monitor. A sigmoidoscopy involves examining the lowest part of the large intestine. A colonoscopy can provide a view of all of the large intestine and often the end of the small intestine, which is frequently affected by Crohn's. In either case, the doctor can directly view the colon to check for signs of ulcers, inflammation, or bleeding. The doctor can also take small samples of tissue to examine under a microscope, known as a biopsy. This helps determine whether the tissue shows signs of Crohn's disease or other problems.\ Computed tomography ( CT) scan: CT scanning uses computer-aided X-ray techniques to make more detailed images of the abdomen and pelvis than can be seen in traditional X-rays. CT scans can help find abscesses that might not show up on other X-rays. Abscesses are small pockets of infection. Leukocyte scintigraphy: White blood cells gather at spots in your body where there's inflammation. For this test, the doctor will take a little blood from your arm and add a harmless amount of a radioactive substance. He'll put it back in your body and use a special camera to see if the cells travel to spots in your gastrointestinal tract that could signal Crohn's. It's not a commonly used test. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI): Use of MRI to make a Crohn's diagnosis is on the rise. This test gives your doctor a clear picture of the inside of your body, but it doesn't subject you to radiation. It can help your doctor see your small intestines and spot an anal abscess (pus-filled sore) or fistula (tunnel that forms between an abscess and one of your anal glands). When you get this test, you'll lie on a table that slides into a machine, so let your doctor know if you have a problem with enclosed spaces. Video capsule endoscopy: For video capsule endoscopy, you swallow a small capsule or pill that holds a miniature video camera. As it travels through your small intestine, it sends images of the lining to a receiver you wear on a belt around your waist. The doctor downloads the images and reviews them on a computer. They can provide detailed information about early, mild problems associated with Crohn's disease. This technique may be especially helpful if you have symptoms of Crohn's disease that can't be seen by other small bowel tests. While video endoscopy can provide valuable information, it won't work for everyone. You should avoid it if: You have an obstruction in the small intestine. The capsule could get stuck and make the obstruction worse. You have a narrowing in the small intestine, such as from Crohn's disease, previous surgery, or previous radiation therapy. The capsule might become stuck. You have an implanted device like a pacemaker or defibrillator for your heart. Some doctors worry that wireless transmissions from the capsule might interfere with them. After the exams, lab tests, and imaging tests are done, your doctor will discuss the findings with you. If your doctor believes you have Crohn's disease, then you can work together to develop a treatment plan to manage the symptoms and control the disease."
322,"Fibromyalgia is the second most common condition affecting your bones and muscles. Yet it's often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Its classic symptoms are widespread muscle and joint pain and fatigue. There's no cure. But a combination of medication, exercise, managing your stress, and healthy habits may ease your symptoms enough that you can live a normal, active life. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but some think it's a problem with how your brain and spinal cord process pain signals from your nerves. We do know certain things suggest you're more likely to get it: You're a woman. You have another painful disease, such as arthritis, or an infection. You have a mood disorder, like anxiety or depression. You were physically or emotionally abused or have PTSD. You rarely exercise. Other family members have it. Simply put, you ache all over. Common symptoms include: Muscle pain, burning, twitching, or tightness Low pain threshold or tender points Draining fatigue Trouble concentrating and remembering, called ""fibro fog"" Insomnia or not sleeping well Feeling nervous, worried, or depressed Fibromyalgia can feel similar to osteoarthritis, bursitis, and tendinitis. But rather than hurting in a specific area, the pain and stiffness could be throughout your body. Other fibro symptoms can include: Belly pain, bloating, queasiness, constipation, and diarrhea (irritable bowel syndrome) Headaches Dry mouth, nose, and eyes Sensitivity to cold, heat, light, or sound Peeing more often Numbness or tingling in your face, arms, hands, legs, or feet Your doctor will examine you and ask you about your past medical issues and about other close family members. There's no test that can tell you that you have fibromyalgia. Instead, because the symptoms are so similar to other conditions, your doctor will want to rule out illnesses such as an underactive thyroid, different types of arthritis, and lupus. So you may get blood tests to check hormone levels and signs of inflammation, as well as X-rays. If your doctor can't find another reason for how you feel, they'll use a two-part scoring system to measure how widespread your pain has been and how much your symptoms affect your daily life. Using those results, together you'll come up with a plan to manage the condition. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe pain relievers, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and drugs that help you sleep. The three drugs approved specifically for fibro pain are: Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Milnacipran ( Savella) Pregabalin ( Lyrica) Over-the-counter painkillers may help, too. Stronger medicines, like opioids, tend not to work well in the long run, and you could become dependent on them. Regular moderate exercise is key to controlling fibro. You'll want to do low-impact activities that build your endurance, stretch and strengthen your muscles, and improve your ability to move easily -- like yoga, tai chi, Pilates, and even walking. Exercise also releases endorphins, which fight pain, stress, and feeling down. And it can help you sleep better. You can try complementary therapies, including massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic manipulation, to ease aches and stress, too. A counselor, therapist, or support group may help you deal with difficult emotions and how to explain to others what's going on with you."
323,"If you have human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), you need to take several medicines every day to help you stay healthy so you don't develop AIDS. You also need regular checkups to manage the disease and take the best possible care of yourself. Many different medical professionals provide care, comfort, and treatment for people with HIV. They offer services that range from primary health care to information about the disease and about nutrition. This is known as an ""interdisciplinary care team."" The specific providers you need will depend on your overall health and preferences. For help finding HIV/ AIDS services, visit AIDS.gov. This is your team leader, the person who plans your treatment and watches your progress. Your primary provider could be a medical doctor ( MD, DO), a physician assistant ( PA), or a nurse practitioner ( NP). You choose which you want to work with. It's best to find someone you're comfortable with because this person will be your main point of contact for a long time. She will prescribe the medicines you need, such as an antiretroviral medication to control the HIV virus to help you stay well for many years. If your primary HIV care provider is not an expert in infectious diseases, she may refer you to one. If she is, you'll need a general doctor for other health issues and preventive care, such as heart health screenings and OB/ GYN exams for women. This doctor is trained to diagnose and manage infections like HIV. An infectious disease expert also can watch for other infections that are more likely to develop if you have HIV, including hepatitis C, tuberculosis, and certain types of pneumonia. You might choose this specialist as your HIV care team leader, or your primary care doctor may refer you to him. These professionals are the backbone of your health care team. They help provide and coordinate care during your doctor visits and may take blood samples and do other tests. Pharmacists work with your HIV team leaders to develop a medication treatment plan to help you feel better. This professional can answer your questions about drug safety and side effects. Many offer vaccines, including the flu shot, which people with HIV need every year. Your treatment involves caring for both your body and your mind. About 6 in 10 people with HIV have depression -- most of them women. Your HIV care team should include a counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist who can offer emotional support and suggest ways to treat any mental health disorders. Smart food choices are always important for good health. But that's especially true when your immune system is fighting off a serious infection like HIV. A nutritionist or dietician can help you create a meal plan that provides the nutrients you need. HIV can cause sores and infections in your mouth, teeth, and gums. In fact, the first signs of an HIV infection are often in your mouth. Regular cleanings can help prevent tooth decay and the spread of bacteria that can lead to an infection in your bloodstream. That can be life threatening in people with HIV. This professional isn't a doctor but someone who helps take care of any concerns you may have while you're living with HIV. She can offer support and teach you ways to handle issues. Social workers are sometimes called ""patient navigators."" This person helps you find and coordinate many of the needs that often come with a complicated disease. For example, your case manager may help you apply for insurance benefits or get housing, or find mental health or substance abuse services. Your case manager also will follow up to make sure you receive the service you need. You don't have to have a case manager. But research shows that people with HIV who use one are more likely to visit their doctor at least once every 6 months. Staying in touch with your doctor is critical to staying healthy if you have HIV. Your HIV treatment team also may include members who provide: Spiritual care Substance use/abuse counseling Transportation assistance"
324,"It's a common complaint: ADHD makes it hard for your child to focus on a task long enough to start it, let alone finish it. Sure, you could pick up that dirty sock on the floor yourself, but your child needs to learn ways to get things done on his own. These tips could make both your lives easier. You can't just tell a child with ADHD to go clean her room. That chore is too big for a kid who's easily distracted. And the meaning is hazy: What qualifies as ""clean,"" anyway? Break down the job into small, specific tasks: Put shirts in the drawer. Put toys in the basket. Put books on the shelf. Make the bed. Write them down, so your kid can check off the tasks as she finishes each one. Add a picture of the clean room to the checklist so she can see the goal. Use large, colorful sticky notes. Put them where they'll do the most good, in places where your child needs to remember something -- "" Brush your teeth"" on the bathroom mirror or "" Do you have your backpack?"" by the door, for examples. Use a calendar for ongoing weekly tasks or projects that will take a while. Get a big one. Hang it somewhere your child will see it many times a day. Let him fill in and check off deadlines. Kids with ADHD need motivation, so reward a job well done. You don't have to spoil your child with money, expensive gifts, or food. Prizes can be small. It's more important to give them often. Give something your child wants. Young kids like stickers or trading cards. Older kids want time on their i Pad or cell phone. Relate the chore to the reward. For instance, give your kid 5 minutes of video-game time for every 5 minutes she spends cleaning. Avoid big, long-term rewards, like a camping trip if she keeps her room clean for a month. That kind of goal is too abstract and too far off to inspire a kid with ADHD. Does your child promise to walk the dog, do his homework, and clean his room in the half hour before dinner? He's clearly not aware of how long all that will take. Coach him into coming up with sensible time-frames for each piece. Help him figure out what he needs to do first and what can wait. Give your child a timer or alarm, perhaps on a watch or phone, when he's doing a task. Set it to go off every few minutes. If he gets sidetracked, the sound will remind him to focus. If you get frustrated when your child doesn't follow through, remember that it's not her fault. It's just how her brain works. Having ADHD is hard for her, too. She probably gets called out by teachers, peers, and maybe even you many times a day. Don't dwell on her mistakes. Focus on her strengths and play up her successes."
325,"Charcot foot, also called Charcot arthropathy, is a disease that attacks the bones, joints, and soft tissue in your feet. When it starts, you may not realize something's wrong. But eventually, it can cause painful sores or change the shape of your foot. But if you know what to look for, your doctor can diagnose and treat the problem before it causes much damage. Charcot foot affects people who can't feel anything in their feet and ankles because of nerve damage. That's a common problem for people with diabetes. But other things can cause nerve damage, too, including: Alcohol or drug abuse An infection Spinal cord disease or injury Parkinson's disease HIV Syphilis There's no specific cause for Charcot foot. But some things can trigger it: A sprain or broken bone that doesn't get treatment quickly A sore on your foot that doesn't heal An infection Foot surgery that heals slowly As these problems begin, you may not know that your foot is hurt since nerve damage keeps you from feeling pain. So the injury or sore gets worse as you walk on it. Then the bones in the foot begin to lose the calcium that makes them strong. As your bones get weaker, they can break and move out of place. When that happens: Your foot may lose its shape. The arch in the middle of your foot may drop until the bones are lower than your heel or toes. Doctors sometimes call this ârocker bottom.â Your toes may curl. Your ankle might become twisted and unsteady. Bones may press against your shoes. This can cause open sores on your skin that can get infected. Poor blood flow, which is a common side effect of diabetes, may make it hard for infections to heal. If that goes on too long, you may need to have your foot removed. When Charcot foot begins, your foot will be: Reddish Feel warm to the touch Swollen It can be hard to know for sure that you have Charcot foot, especially early on. X-rays and lab tests may be normal. Plus, other foot problems can have the same symptoms. If your doctor isn't a foot specialist (they are called podiatrists) or doesn't treat diabetes often, they may not know much about Charcot foot. If you're having foot problems, try to find a doctor who can give you the correct diagnosis. It can take several months to treat Charcot foot. The key is to ease the stress on your injured foot. Stay off your foot. Your doctor will put your foot in a cast. This protects it and keeps it from moving. Over the next 2 or 3 months, your doctor will probably change the cast several times as the swelling goes down. You'll use crutches, a wheelchair, or a knee walker to get around. ( A knee walker looks kind of like a mini-bicycle with four wheels. You bend your leg at the knee, then put your knee in the âseat.â) Prevent new problems. After your doctor takes off the last cast, you'll wear prescription shoes that fit your feet properly. They'll relieve the pressure points that can cause injuries or sores. You might need to use a brace, as well. And your doctor may tell you to change some of your day-to-day habits so there's less wear and tear on your foot. Repair bones with surgery. Your doctor will only go this route if your injuries make your foot unstable or you can't wear special shoes or braces. A bad sore also could lead to surgery. During the operation, the surgeon might realign or fuse bones to make your foot more stable. She might also smooth sharp bones that could cut into your skin and cause sores. Whether you've had Charcot foot or want to prevent it, make sure you care for your feet. Get regular checkups with a doctor who treats feet or diabetic foot problems. Check your feet carefully every day. Look for swelling, redness, warm spots, or sores. Check between your toes, too. Wash your feet every day. Always wear socks and shoes."
326,"The meningococcal vaccine protects you from four types of bacteria that cause meningococcal disease. This illness can cause meningitis, an infection of the lining around the brain or spinal cord. It can also cause a blood infection (meningococcal bacteremia), pneumonia, and other problems. Ten percent to 15% of people who are infected with the disease die from it, even if they were treated with antibiotics. As many as 20% of those who survive may have lasting problems such as hearing loss, brain damage, seizures, or loss of limbs. Because this illness is serious, it's important you get vaccinated if you are at risk. You can catch meningococcal infection through close contact with someone who has the bacteria in his or her throat or nose. Early symptoms of both meningitis and blood infection can be confused with the flu or a cold, but symptoms can rapidly become more severe and may include: Sudden high fever Headache Stiff neck Aches Fatigue Purplish rash on arms and legs Other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and changes in mental state The CDC recommends you get the vaccine if you are an adult and: Are living in a dorm as a first-year college student Work with meningococcal bacteria in a lab Are in the military Are traveling to or living in a country where meningococcal disease is common, such as in certain parts of Africa Have a damaged spleen, or it's been removed Have an immune system disorder called terminal complement deficiency Are taking eculizumab ( Soliris) May have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak Have HIV You shouldn't get either type of meningococcal vaccine if you: Are moderately or seriously ill; wait until you recover. Have had a serious allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis) to a previous dose Had a severe reaction to any part of the vaccine If you are pregnant or have other concerns, ask your doctor which meningitis vaccine is right for you. In most cases, adults only need one dose. But if you remain at risk, you may need a booster. Some adults may need another type of meningitis vaccine, the serogroup B meningococcal vaccine, if they are exposed to this virus through work or travel or if they have a damaged or missing spleen, or certain immune system disorders. The vaccine can't cause meningococcal disease. If you have a reaction to the meningococcal shot, it will most likely be mild. Side effects may include: Mild pain and redness at the injection site Slight fever In rare cases, a meningococcal vaccine may cause a severe allergic reaction. Signs of this include: Hoarseness, wheezing, trouble breathing, or swallowing Hives, itching, skin warmth, or redness Paleness Stomach cramps, diarrhea, or vomiting Anxiety or headache Weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness If you have any signs of a severe reaction: Call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately. Describe when you had the vaccine and what happened. Have a health care professional report the reaction."
327,"Drinking plenty of water will usually take care of your thirst. But sometimes, no amount of water seems like enough. You'll drink and drink and drink -- and drink -- and still be thirsty. That's polydipsia. People who have polydipsia will also spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Instead of the 3 quarts most adults will pee out in a day, they can pee out as much as 16 quarts, depending on how much fluid they drink and what's causing their polydipsia. Treatment for it depends on why you have it. You usually get polydipsia as a symptom of other things. Diabetes: Super high blood sugar will make you pee a lot. The more you pee, the more dehydrated and thirstier you get, and the more you drink. Diabetes insipidus: What most people think of when they hear ""diabetes"" has to do with your pancreas. Diabetes insipidus happens when there's a problem with your kidneys or your pituitary gland, which makes a hormone that helps control how much water your kidneys keep in your body. Mental illness: Some people have an uncontrollable urge to drink water, so they drink it all day even though they don't need to. This is called psychogenic polydipsia. Mental illnesses that can cause polydipsia include: Schizophrenia and other personality disorders Mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety Anorexia Brain injuries and damage: This could be from diseases like HIV or other illnesses. Drinking too much water can upset the balance of chemistry in your body. Normally you get rid of extra water by peeing, but when your body can't keep up, your blood gets diluted. It could lead to too little sodium in your blood (hyponatremia) with too much water in and around your cells. This condition can damage your organs and bones. It can also cause: Headache Nausea Cramps Slow reflexes Slurred speech Low energy Confusion Seizures As hyponatremia gets worse, you could go into a coma or die. If you've been extremely thirsty for a few days and peeing a lot, and you have any of these other symptoms, call your doctor right away. People with diabetes will have to adjust their care routine to try to manage their blood sugar better. Your doctor might prescribe medication or hormones for diabetes insipidus. For psychogenic polydipsia, treatment includes: Limiting the fluids you drink Counseling Medication"
328,"When you have acromegaly, your body makes too much growth hormone ( GH). In children, GH stimulates growth and development. In adults, GH affects energy levels, muscle strength, bone health, and one's sense of well-being. There are treatments for acromegaly, and every case is different. In most cases, it might be years before you notice symptoms. Most people who get acromegaly are middle-aged. Children can have problems with too much growth hormone -- a condition called gigantism. The most common cause is a pituitary adenoma, a noncancerous tumor that makes growth hormone from your pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is in the skull, just below the brain. It is part of your endocrine, or hormone system. Because of the tumor, your body makes too much growth hormone. Once in a while, tumors in the pancreas, liver, or parts of the brain can cause acromegaly by producing higher levels of another hormone, called IGF-1, which causes the symptoms you see. Changes happen slowly, sometimes over years. Your hands and feet are usually large. You might notice a change in your ring or shoe size, especially your shoe width. The features in your face -- your lips, jaw, nose, and tongue -- often change, becoming coarser and broader. Your teeth may begin to space out. Your brow and lower jaw may start to jut out from your face. Other symptoms may include: Achy joints, possibly leading to arthritis Stiff, rough body hair Hoarser, deeper voice Pinched nerve problems High blood pressure Heart disease Thickening skin with skin tags Sweating a lot with oily skin Headaches Snoring and sleep apnea, a breathing problem that happens during sleep Weakness and being tired Tingling or pain in fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) Vision problems Lower sex drive Changes in menstrual cycle and breast discharge in women Erectile dysfunction in men You can sometimes have problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, a higher chance of heart disease, and an enlarged heart. You will also likely need to have a colonoscopy. The sooner your acromegaly is diagnosed, the better. When you see your doctor, he'll ask you questions like these: Why did you come to see me today? What changes have you noticed? When did you first notice the problem? How are you feeling? To tell for sure if you have acromegaly, your doctor will do blood tests to see if your IGF-1 hormone levels are high for your age. Your doctor may do a test that measures your growth hormone level after you drink a sugary drink. This is called a glucose tolerance test, and it should normally cause your growth hormone level to drop. If these tests are abnormal, you will have an MRI that will help your doctor see if a tumor is growing in the pituitary gland. If you find out you have acromegaly, you'll probably have a lot of questions. You may want to start by asking your doctor: What is acromegaly? What is causing my acromegaly? What treatment do you recommend? How will treatment change my symptoms? What will success look like? What are the side effects? How many other people with acromegaly have you treated? Am I likely to get this again? Your doctor will work with you to come up with the best treatment plan, taking into account your age, health, and how far along your condition is. There are three ways to treat acromegaly: Surgery Medicine Radiation Surgery is often the first treatment for people with large tumors affecting vital areas, especially if they are pressing on nerves that harm your vision. The surgeon will remove the tumor from the base of the brain. To get to it, they'll make a small cut in your nose or the inside of your upper lip. In some cases, your doctor may have you take medicine before the surgery to shrink the tumor. After the surgery, your doctor will measure your hormones and will do imaging of the area where the tumor was removed. Your symptoms may start to get better after only a few days. Your doctor may recommend taking one of these medicines after surgery to help control or cure the disease and bring hormone levels back to normal: Somatostatin analogs (lanreotide or octreotide) Growth hormone receptor antagonists (pegvisomant) Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine) Those drugs either lower the level of growth hormone in your blood or block the effects it has on your body. Radiation helps if you have parts of a tumor left after surgery, or if you need more help lowering growth hormone levels after taking medicine. It can help stop the tumor from growing and your body from making too much growth hormone. When you get diagnosed with a condition like acromegaly, it can help to connect with other people who have it. Ask your doctor if there are local support groups, or consider joining an online support group. If you think it would be helpful to talk with a counselor, your doctor can give you a referral. Let your family and friends know what they can do to support you. They'll want to help, but they may not know what to offer, so be specific about what you would find helpful. Your particular experience with acromegaly will depend on how the condition has affected you. Work closely with your doctor so you understand your options and what you can expect as your treatment moves forward.

329,"Viral pneumonia is an infection of your lungs caused by a virus. The most common cause is the flu, but you can also get viral pneumonia from the common cold and other viruses. These nasty germs usually stick to the upper part of your respiratory system. But the trouble starts when they get down into your lungs. Then the air sacs in your lungs get infected and inflamed, and they fill up with fluid. Anything that weakens your body's defenses (immune system) can raise your chances of getting pneumonia. You have a higher chance of getting viral pneumonia if you: Are 65 or older Have chronic (ongoing) conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease Are recovering from surgery Don't eat right or get enough vitamins and minerals Have another condition that weakens your body's defenses Smoke Drink too much alcohol Are HIV positive Recently had an organ transplant Have leukemia, lymphoma, or severe kidney disease Viral pneumonia usually moves in steadily over a few days. On the first day it feels like the flu, with symptoms like: Fever Dry cough Headache Sore throat Loss of appetite Muscle pain After a day or so your fever might get worse. You might also feel like you can't catch your breath. If your lungs are invaded with bacteria, you might also get some of the same symptoms as bacterial pneumonia, like: A wet, gunky cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus Chills that make you shake Fatigue (feeling very tired) Low appetite Sharp or stabby chest pain, especially when you cough or take a deep breath Sweating a lot Fast breathing and heartbeat Blue lips and fingernails Confusion, especially if you're older You can do these things to help lower your odds of getting viral pneumonia: Get a flu shot every year. Wash your hands regularly, especially after you go to the bathroom and before you eat. Eat right, with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Exercise. Get enough sleep. Don't smoke. Stay away from people who are sick. Your doctor might be able to tell if you have viral pneumonia just by examining you and asking questions about your symptoms and general health. Chances are your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. That's because certain sounds can mean fluid is in your lungs. But if your doctor isn't sure, you might have to get a chest X-ray. Some people might need extra tests. These might include: A pulse oximetry (a small gizmo clipped to your finger checks for enough oxygen in your blood) Blood tests Tests of the gunk you cough up (sputum tests) CT scan to look more closely at your lungs A pleural fluid culture (where your doctor takes some fluid from your chest through a needle) Bronchoscopy -- a look into your lungs through a scope Your doctor won't prescribe antibiotics, because they don't kill viruses. Usually, viral pneumonia just has to run its course. In some cases, your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication. He might also suggest medication for pain and fever. Here are some things you can do that will help you feel better: Get lots of rest. Drink plenty of fluids. They'll loosen up the gunk in your lungs so you can cough it out. Use a humidifier or take a warm bath (more gunk-loosening). Don't smoke. Stay home until your fever goes down and you're not coughing anything out. You'll begin to feel better as the virus runs its course. This usually takes a few days. But you might not feel completely better for about 1 to 3 weeks. If you're elderly or have other medical conditions, your recovery could take longer. Make sure you keep your follow-up appointments so your doctor can check your lungs. Hospital stays for viral pneumonia aren't common. But if your case is stubborn or severe, and you do have to go to the hospital, you might get: Oxygen treatment IV fluids and medications Treatments to help loosen up the gunk"
330,"Dementia is a syndrome that involves a significant global impairment of cognitive abilities such as attention, memory, language, logical reasoning, and problem-solving severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning. Dementia is not temporary confusion or forgetfulness that might result from a self-limited infection, underlying illness, or side effects of medications. Dementia typically worsens over time. In diagnosing dementia, a doctor uses certain criteria. Criteria for the diagnosis of dementia include impairment of attention, orientation, memory, judgment, language, motor and spatial skills, and function. ( By definition, dementia is not due to major depression or schizophrenia.) Dementia is reported in as many as 1% of adults age 60. It has been estimated that the frequency of dementia doubles every five years after age 65. There are a number of causes of dementia. In general, dementia is more frequent with increasing age. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Among other causes are Lewy Body Dementia, vascular dementia, dementia related to Parkinson's Disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD), and dementias caused by other medical conditions (thyroid disease, drug toxicity, thiamine deficiency with alcoholism, and others) as well as brain injury, strokes, multiple sclerosis, infection of the brain (such as meningitis and syphilis), HIV infection, fluid build-up in the brain (hydrocephalus), Pick's disease, and brain tumors. Dementia is first evaluated by a doctor who reviews the patient's history and performs a physical exam. Further testing is chosen according to clues from the history and physical. This testing might include blood and urine tests, chest X-ray, brain scanning ( MRI or CT scanning), electroencephalogram ( EEG), and spinal fluid analysis by lumbar puncture procedure. Dementia treatment is directed toward managing symptoms, and identifying whether or not there may be a reversible cause. Medicines such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., galantamine, donepezil) can sometimes help to slow the progression of cognitive changes, but quite often the effects of medicines are only modest and cannot prevent eventual worsening of the underlying condition. Agitation and other emotional concerns are generally addressed as part of the overall treatment plan."
331,"The human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, weakens your immune system so it can't fight off common germs, viruses, fungi, and other invaders. It's the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Someone with HIV can get sick from things that don't usually affect people, and people with AIDS tend to get certain uncommon diseases and illnesses. Anyone can get HIV. Both men and women can spread HIV. A person with HIV can feel OK and still give the virus to others. According to the CDC, about 1.1 million people in the U. S. are living with the HIV infection, and there are about 37,600 new HIV infections each year. Having HIV does not always mean that you have AIDS. It can take many years for people with the virus to develop AIDS. HIV and AIDS can't be cured, but the medications available today help people stay healthy, live longer, and even obtain a normal life expectancy. HIV attacks and destroys a type of white blood cell: the CD4 cell, also called the T-cell. Its job is to fight disease. But HIV uses proteins in the cell to make a copy of itself and then kills the cell. This can go on for 10 years or more without you having any symptoms. AIDS is the later stage of HIV infection. When your immune system has a very low level of CD4 cells, you can't fight off things that most people wouldn't get sick from. People with HIV are said to have AIDS when they get certain infections or cancers, called AIDS-defining illnesses, or when their CD4 count in a blood test is less than 200. You can get HIV when an infected person's body fluids -- including blood, semen, fluids from the vagina, or breast milk -- get into your blood. That can happen through broken skin or the linings in your mouth, anus, penis, or vagina. People commonly get HIV from: Having unprotected sex with an infected person Sharing a needle to take drugs Dirty needles used for a tattoo or in body piercing Mothers with HIV also can give the virus to their babies, before or when they're born or through breastfeeding. It's possible to get HIV from a blood transfusion from an infected person, although it's very unlikely in the U. S. and Western Europe, where all medical blood is tested for HIV. Health care workers have to take special precautions. They could get HIV after being poked with needles that have HIV-infected blood or after infected blood gets on an open cut or splashes into their eyes or inside their nose. The best way to protect yourself from HIV is to avoid activities that put you at risk. Use latex condoms or a latex barrier whenever you have sex -- vaginal, anal, or oral. Don't inject drugs, and don't use someone else's needle if you do. Some people who are at very high risk for an HIV infection use pre-exposure prophylaxis ( Pr EP). They don't have HIV yet, but they take medicines every day to help lower their chance of getting infected. The only way to know if you have HIV is to take an HIV test. Most look for antibodies that fight the virus or traces of the virus itself in your blood, but you can also check urine or fluid from your mouth (not saliva). A positive test means that there were traces of HIV; a negative test means that no signs of HIV were found. Some kinds of tests can give a result in 20-30 minutes. Most tests can't detect HIV right after infection, because it takes usually takes 2-8 weeks for your body to make antibodies or for enough virus to grow inside you. It may take up to 6 months before you'll see a positive result, which means an early test could be negative even though you're infected. Clinics that do HIV tests keep your results secret. Some may even do tests anonymously, without ever taking your name. You can also buy test kits at the drugstore and take the test at home. Everyone between 15 and 65 should get tested, as well as all pregnant women. If you're at high risk, because you use needles for drugs or have multiple sex partners, for example, you should get tested at least once a year. If you've been stuck by a needle or been in contact with a lot of blood from a person you aren't sure is negative for HIV, you should get tested, too. Some people get flu-like symptoms within a month after they've been infected, but these symptoms often go away within a month. You could have HIV for many years before feeling ill at all. Before you're diagnosed with HIV, you may get shingles. If you have had HIV for many years, you may get other infections related to advance HIV pr AIDS (see below). Both women and men may get thrush, a kind of yeast infection in your mouth or on your tongue. Women could get severe vaginal yeast infections. Signs that HIV is turning into AIDS include: A fever that won't go away Shortness of breath Diarrhea that won't go away Sweating while you sleep Feeling tired all the time, but not from stress or lack of sleep Losing weight Swollen glands in your neck, groin, or underarms Yeast infections in your mouth People with AIDS can get other infections very easily. These ""opportunistic infections"" aren't a problem for someone with a healthy immune system, but someone with a low CD4 count can't fight them off. They can lead to a diagnosis of AIDS because doctors know that HIV probably played a role. Some health problems that people with AIDS often have are: Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin tumor that looks like dark or purple blotches on their skin or in their mouth Mental changes and headaches caused by fungal infections or tumors in their brain and spinal cord Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing because of infections in their lungs Dementia Severe malnutrition Chronic diarrhea We've come a long way from the days when a diagnosis of HIV equaled a death sentence. Today, a variety of treatments can significantly slow down, and sometimes stop altogether, the progress of HIV infection. After you're diagnosed, your doctor will start you on a treatment plan with different types of anti- HIV drugs. This is called ART, for antiretroviral therapy, and each medicine is an ARV, or antiretroviral. You must take the right drugs at the right time, every single day. If you don't, the virus can change into a strain that is harder to treat. Although the great majority of persons tolerate ARVs very well, these medicines can cause side effects, including: Nausea, upset stomach Skin rash or yellowing skin Fatigue Strange dreams or insomnia Losing or gaining body fat Lidney or liver problems Brittle bones If you develop these or other symptoms while taking ARVs, you should contact your doctor before stopping the drugs. There may be ways to treat the symptoms rather than having to stop the life-saving ARV drugs. Newer HIV medications only need to be taken once a day. But these may not work on treatment-resistant strains. If you have AIDS, you'll probably also take drugs to combat and prevent opportunistic infections. Your doctor can check how well your treatment is working by measuring the amount of HIV in your blood, which is called your viral load. The goal is to get it so low that most labs tests can't detect it, less than 20 copies in a milliliter of blood. This doesn't mean the virus is gone or cured; it does means the medication is working and you should keep taking it. Most people who get the right treatment will do well and live healthy lives for years. Starting ART soon after diagnosis of HIV infection, especially before the CD4 count drops to low levels, is key. Even with treatment, though, some people may get sicker faster than others. Take good care of yourself. Build a good relationship with an experienced doctor specializing in HIV and AIDS. Stick to your HIV medication schedule, and get regular lab work to catch any problems early."
332,"An MRI is a test that produces very clear pictures of the human body without the use of X-rays. Instead, MRI uses a large magnet, radio waves, and a computer to produce these images. In prostate cancer patients, MRI may be used to examine the prostate and nearby lymph nodes to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Yes. The MRI examination poses no risk to the average patient if appropriate safety guidelines are followed. People who have had heart surgery and people with the following medical devices can be safely examined with MRI: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Cardiac valve replacements (except the Starr- Edwards metallic ball/cage) Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some conditions may make an MRI examination not a good idea. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions: Heart pacemaker Cerebral aneurysm clip (metal clip on a blood vessel in the brain) Implanted insulin pump (for treatment of diabetes), narcotics pump (for pain medication), or implanted nerve stimulators ( TENS) for back pain Metal in the eye or eye socket Cochlear (ear) implant for hearing impairment Implanted spine stabilization rods Severe lung disease (such as tracheomalacia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) Severe acid reflux Weight of more than 300 pounds Not being able to lie on back for 30 to 60 minutes Claustrophobia (fear of closed or narrow spaces) Allow 1 1/2 hours for your MRI exam. In most cases, the procedure takes 45 to 60 minutes, during which several dozen images may be taken. Personal items such as your watch, wallet (including any credit cards with magnetic strips - should not be brought into the room with the MRI machine in it. The credit cards will be erased by the magnet), and jewelry should be left at home or removed prior to the MRI scan. Secured lockers should be available to store personal items. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during the MRI scan. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound, which will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should notice no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require an injection of a dye (contrast material). This helps identify certain anatomic structures on the scan images. Before the exam, feel free to ask questions and tell the technician or doctor if you have any concerns. People who get anxious when in tight spaces (claustrophobic) may benefit from talking to their doctor before the procedure. Some options include taking a prescription medication before the procedure to relieve anxiety or having the exam done in one of the newer and less confining MRI units, called an open MRI, when available. You should be able to resume your usual activities immediately. Your doctor will discuss the test results with you."
333,"HIV and AIDS are related, but they're not the same. HIV is a virus. It may lead to AIDS, the disease you can get after the virus has infected your body for several years and has weakened your immune system. Not everyone who has HIV will get AIDS, but without treatment with antriretroviral drugs the infection will progress to AIDS. That usually happens in 10-15 years, according to the World Health Organization. Many people with the virus don't know they have it. Of the approximately 1.1 million people infected with HIV in the U. S., about 160,000 have not been diagnosed and are therefore unaware of their HIV infection. They cannot be treated effectively until their infections are diagnosed by a blood test and they see a doctor. There are about 38,000 new cases of HIV infection each year in the U. S. Worldwide, there were 36.7 million cases of HIV in 2016. HIV stands for âhuman immunodeficiency virus.â â Immunodeficiencyâ means the systems that fight illnesses in your body aren't working. Your immune system has cells called CD4 or T cells that help keep you healthy. HIV attacks these cells. The virus copies itself over and over, reducing the number of CD4 cells in your body. Without that armor, you become more vulnerable to infections from bacteria and viruses. Antiretroviral drug therapy stops the destruction of CD4 cells. You can get HIV from direct contact with: Blood Semen Vaginal fluid Breast milk Most commonly, the virus is passed from person to person by: Sex Sharing needles Mother-to-baby infection during pregnancy People with a new HIV infection often say they feel like they have the flu. Early symptoms include: Fever Headaches Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and groin area If you have such symptoms and you might have been recently exposed to HIV, you should see a doctor to get tested for HIV. AIDS stands for âacquired immunodeficiency syndrome.â HIV can become this disease if it's not treated. About 1.1 million people in the U. S. have HIV infection. About 18,000 were diagnosed with AIDS in 2016. It's the third, and most advanced stage of the infection. Persons who develop AIDS were either never diagnosed with HIV infection or were otherwise not treated with HIV drugs early enough to prevent progression to AIDS. When you have HIV, your doctor will watch the amount of the virus in your system. You may hear this amount called your âviral load.â Two things will tell your doctor if it has become AIDS: Your CD4 count. A healthy immune system has a CD4 count of 500 to 1,600. A person with AIDS has a CD4 count below 200. AIDS-defining infections. They're also called opportunistic infections. These generally occur in persons with a CD4 count below 200. Viruses, bacteria, or fungi that don't usually make healthy people sick can cause these infections in someone with HIV. The amount of time it takes for HIV to become AIDS is different for everyone. Without treatment, you can live with the virus for 10-15 years before getting AIDS. With treatment you may never develop AIDS. Once you have AIDS, you have it. But you can live a long time with antiretroviral treatment. Warning signs that you may have AIDS include: Sudden weight loss Night sweats Fever that keeps coming back Feeling very tired for no reason Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week Sores in your mouth, in your anal area, or on your genitals Pneumonia Blotches on your skin or inside your mouth, nose, or eyelids Memory loss Depression More than 25 drugs are approved to treat HIV. You may hear them called âantiretroviral drugs.â Your doctor will prescribe a combination of these medications as antiretroviral therapy, or ART. The medicines you take will help keep the virus from making copies of itself. That will keep you healthy and also lower your risk of spreading HIV to others. The goal of ART is to lower your viral load. It won't cure your HIV, but with the right medicine, the amount of the virus in your blood may drop below a detectable level and stay that way for a long time. Stick to your treatment plan, because people with the virus are living longer and better than ever."
334," Swollen glands are a sign that your body is fighting off an infection or an illness. Most of the time, they return to normal size when their job is done. These glands are your lymph nodes. You have them throughout your body. But there are clusters of them in places like your neck, under your arm and in the crease between your thigh and your torso (where your leg begins). You can sometimes feel these clusters as little bumps, especially if they're swollen. They're part of your lymphatic system. Along with your spleen, tonsils, and adenoids, they help protect you from harmful germs. These round and bean-shaped glands have immune cells called lymphocytes in them. They attack bacteria, viruses, and other things that can make you sick. When you're fighting off harmful germs, your body makes more of those immune cells -- that causes the swelling. Your lymph nodes come across all kinds of germs, so they can be swollen for lots of reasons. Usually, it's something that's easy to treat, like a cold, an ear infection, or an infectedtooth. Much less often, it can be a more serious illness. They can include: Tuberculosis, an infection that usually affects your lungs A problem with your immune system, like lupus Certain kinds of cancer, including: Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system Leukemia, a cancer of the blood In most cases, swollen glands return to normal size after the illness or infection has passed. But here are some things to watch for: Glands that swelled up very suddenly Glands that are much larger than they should be, not just mildly swollen Glands that feel hard or don't move when you push on them Glands that stay swollen for more than 5 days in children or 2 to 4 weeks in adults The area around the glands turns red or purple, it feels warm or you see pus Swelling in your arm or groin Sudden weight loss A fever that doesn't go away Night sweats If you notice any of these, see your doctor. Your doctor might be able to get an idea of what's making your glands swell by where they are in your body. She also may recommend one of these tests to find out more about what's going on: Biopsy. Lymph node tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope. PET scan. This looks at the chemical activity in parts of your body. It may help identify a variety of conditions like some cancers, heart disease and brain disorders. CT scan. A series of X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to form a more complete picture. If what's causing the swelling isn't something like a virus that will go away on its own, treatment can include: Antibiotics for an infection caused by bacteria Medications that help with inflammation (for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis) Surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy (for types of cancer)"
335,"When you have Crohn's disease, you want to prevent flare-ups and keep them away for good. Inflammation in your intestines causes symptoms like belly pain and diarrhea. Anti-inflammatory drugs ease them and may even keep them away for years. Although they aren't a cure, they can help you feel much better. Your doctor will help you decide which one is best for you. These are one of the oldest treatments for Crohn's disease. Your doctor may suggest one: If your case is mild to moderate If other drugs aren't helping If your symptoms are severe right away Your doctor may call them corticosteroids, but most people just call them steroids. They're not the same as the drugs you take to build your muscles. Most of them will cut inflammation all over your body, not just in your intestines. They work quickly during flare-ups and can ease symptoms for days after you take them. There are a few different types. Some you take by mouth, and others you get through an IV. Steroid drugs you take by mouth include: Budesonide ( Entocort EC) Prednisone ( Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) Budesonide lowers inflammation only in the intestine when you take it as a capsule. Because it's designed to dissolve in the small intestine, it may cause fewer side effects than other steroids. If your Crohn's disease is severe, or it's in many parts of your intestines, you may need a higher dose through an IV. Because they can cause serious side effects, your doctor will keep you on these steroids only as long as it takes to ease your symptoms. You may start on a large dose and then get smaller doses as you feel better. When you take steroids, you might notice one or more of these side effects: Acne Hair growth on your face Night sweats Swelling of the face (called ""moon face"") Trouble sleeping Weight gain More serious side effects include: Cataracts Diabetes Glaucoma High blood pressure Weakened bones and fractures Because steroids weaken your immune system, they can make you more likely to get an infection. Children who take them for a long time may grow more slowly than normal. There's some question about how effective these drugs are for Crohn's. Your doctor may suggest these if you have mild Crohn's disease in your large intestine (also called the colon). Once your symptoms get better, you may continue to take them to prevent flare-ups. There are two main 5- ASA drugs used in Crohn's: Mesalamine ( Apriso, Asacol, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa) Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) The main side effects are: Diarrhea Nausea Stomachache Headache Skin rash Sulfasalazine can cut sperm counts in men, and it may lower your supply of infection-fighting white blood cells. If you're allergic to sulfa drugs, you may have a reaction to sulfasalazine and shouldn't take it. If your Crohn's affects the top part of your intestinal tract, you'll probably take these medicines by mouth. If it's in the lower part, you can take them through your rectum as an enema (when you put liquid into your rectum to help start a bowel movement) or a suppository, a small, round or cone-shaped object you put into your bottom to deliver medicine. Crohn's disease drugs aren't one-size-fits-all. If the treatment you're on isn't working, talk to your doctor about other options."
336,"Vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of blood vessels. When blood vessels become inflamed, they may become weakened, stretch, and either increase in size or become narrow -- even to the point of closing entirely. Vasculitis can affect people of all ages, but there are types of vasculitis that occur in certain age groups more often than others. Some of the many forms of vasculitis may be restricted to particular organs. Examples include vasculitis that affects only the skin, eye, brain, or certain internal organs. There are also types of vasculitis that may affect many organ systems at the same time. Some of these generalized forms may be quite mild and may not require treatment. Others may be severe, affecting critical organs. In many cases, the cause of vasculitis is unknown. In a few cases, however, the origins may be traced to recent or ongoing infections, such as those caused by certain viruses. Occasionally, an allergic reaction to a medication may trigger vasculitis. Vasculitis can sometimes develop after an infection has come and gone. Usually in these cases, the infection triggers an abnormal response in the person's immune system, damaging the blood vessels. Vasculitis also may be related to other diseases of the immune system that the person has had for months or years. For example, it could be a complication of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. Vasculitis can be very serious. In an extreme situation, when a segment of a blood vessel becomes weakened, it may then stretch and bulge (called an aneurysm). The wall of the blood vessel can become so weak that it ruptures and bleeds, possibly causing death. Fortunately, this is a very rare event. If a blood vessel becomes inflamed and narrowed, the blood supply to the area of the body it serves may be partially or completely blocked. If alternate blood vessels (called collateral blood vessels) are not available in sufficient quantity to carry the blood to such sites, the tissue supplied by the affected vessels will die. Because vasculitis can occur in any part of the body, any tissue or organ can be affected. An enormous number of vasculitis symptoms are possible because any organ system may be involved. If the skin is involved, there may be a rash. If nerves suffer loss of blood supply, there may initially be an abnormal sensation followed by a loss of sensation or muscle weakness. Vasculitis in the brain may cause a stroke, or in the heart, may result in a heart attack. Inflammation in the kidney could result in abnormalities noted on urine tests and can lead to progressive kidney failure. Sometimes the symptoms may be as general as fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and loss of energy. If you suffer any unusual symptoms, see your doctor. Treatment of vasculitis depends entirely upon diagnosis and the affected organs. When vasculitis is the result of an allergic reaction, it may go away on its own and not require treatment. In other instances, when critical organs such as the lungs, brain, or kidneys are involved, aggressive and timely treatment is necessary. Treatment generally consists of corticosteroid medications, or simply ""steroids."" Chemotherapy drugs (such as those used to treat cancer) are also used, but in doses usually lower than people with cancer may receive. The goal of this type of therapy is to suppress the abnormal immune response that has led to blood vessel damage. Other medications may include methotrexate or cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxin) and a biologic drug called tocilizumab ( Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lower the dose of steroids that a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. The outlook for someone with vasculitis varies, depending on the type of vasculitis the person has. In the past, people with severe vasculitis may have expected to survive only weeks or months. Today, however, normal life spans are possible with proper treatment. The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment and careful follow-up to be sure that side effects from medications do not develop. Once vasculitis is under control, medications may be cautiously withdrawn, with the hope that the patient will sustain a long remission or cure, without the need for further treatment. Because doctors cannot predict how long a person may remain in remission, it is very important for people with more severe forms of vasculitis to continue under the care of a knowledgeable doctor for the rest of their lives."
337,"Cats aren’t big droolers. While a little drool is nothing to worry about, a waterfall can be a sign your kitty is sick. Here are some reasons your cat might drool too much, along with suggested treatments. Mouth disease and tooth decay. Tartar buildup can rub on the inside of your cat’s lip, causing her to slobber. To check, pull her lip back toward her ear. Do her teeth look like concrete? Are they brown? Are the gums red, swollen, or even bleeding? Try a professional cleaning first, and then brush her teeth daily. Have your vet check for gingivitis, mouth ulcers, and tumors. Trouble swallowing: While playing, a string or a toy might get stuck in your cat’s mouth or wrapped around her tongue. Try to remove the object yourself, or call your vet for help. Then again, your cat might want to resist swallowing just because she has a bad taste in her mouth. Maybe she didn’t quite swallow her medicine, or she licked or ate something gross. Heatstroke: Pets with flat faces, such as Persian cats, are more likely to have heatstroke. It isn’t as common in cats as it is in other animals, though. Still, if your cat's had too much sun or not enough water, that's dangerous for her. Always have fresh, clean water available. Make sure your cat has shady places to cool off, too. On very hot days, keep her indoors, limit her exercise, and never leave her in a parked car. Call your vet right way if you suspect heatstroke. Stress: Open-mouth panting and breathing are signs of anxiety. Being stressed can cause your cat to drool. There may be multiple reasons for her stress. If this happens when you put her in teh car to take her to the vet, try putting her in her carrier in the back seat without driving anywhere. Then, slowly work up to backing out of the driveway and driving around the block. Gradually repeat the routine as needed to ease her stress. You can also drape a breathable cloth over the carrier before heading out, so she doesn’t panic. Organ disease: As pets age, they're more likely to get sick. Liver and kidney diseases can cause drooling, too. Vets suggest annual checkups to diagnose and treat such diseases early. Poisonous plants: Common plants like tulips, azaleas, and chrysanthemums can make your cat drool, as well as make her sick, so don't let your feline friend eat them. For a list of poisonous plants, check with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( ASPCA). Upper respiratory infections: Drooling can signal an infection of the nose, throat, or sinuses. Cats that live in homes or shelters with other pets have a higher risk. Stress is another factor. Only your vet should treat an infection. But you can take steps to protect your cat from getting one: Keep her up to date on vaccines, indoors, and away from other pets, and wash your hands between handling different animals. Only you know your cat’s normal behavior. If it changes for more than a day, she seems stressed, or she isn't eating and playing as usual, let your vet know."
338,"Imagine taking a hard fall off your bike and then not being able to move your arm -- but your arm isn't injured. Neither is any other part of your body. Is the paralysis all in your head? Actually, it might be. You could have what's called conversion disorder. It's a neurological condition that causes physical symptoms -- like a paralyzed arm -- even though doctors can't find any injury or other physical condition to explain them. In other words, your body converted your emotional and psychological stress from falling off your bike into the physical response of your paralyzed arm. It might seem strange, but your symptoms are real, and you can't control them. While the specific cause of conversion disorder is still being studied, researchers think it develops as a way for your brain to deal with emotional strife. It's almost always triggered by stressful situations and other mental disorders. And the symptoms usually develop suddenly. Women are more likely to have it than men. It also happens more often to people with a history of emotional trauma, and in those who have a hard time talking about their feelings. Sometimes, physical symptoms might help resolve some sort of internal conflict. For example, if you're struggling with the desire to hurt someone, conversion disorder may cause you to develop paralysis, making it impossible to act on that desire. Conversion disorder symptoms most commonly look like issues involving your nervous system (brain, spinal cord, or other nerves). These include: Uncontrollable movements Tunnel vision or blindness Loss of smell or speech Numbness or paralysis There's no test to diagnose conversion disorder. And because the cause is unknown, it's usually diagnosed by the process of elimination. When tests rule out other physical, mental, or neurological causes, your doctor may ask you if you've experienced any recent traumatic events. For your doctor to diagnose you with conversion disorder, your symptoms must meet the standards set by the American Psychiatric Association: They affect your movement or senses, and you can't control them. They can be related to a stressful event, but don't have to be. You're not faking them. They can't be explained by any other condition, medication, or behavior. They cause you stress in social and work settings. They aren't caused by another mental health problem. Simply knowing that you're not suffering from a serious physical condition can be enough to for the symptoms to stop. But if they persist, getting help from your doctor early may help prevent long-term effects. There is no specific medication to treat conversion disorder. Psychotherapy treatments are most often used, including: Occupational or physical therapy Counseling Hypnosis Antidepressants or antipsychotic drugs Symptoms can last from a few days to several weeks. Sometimes they just go away as suddenly as they came on. Most of the time they're not life-threatening, but they can still have lasting side effects if you don't seek treatment. The best way to prevent conversion disorder is to try to find effective ways to manage life's unavoidable stresses. Physical exercise and stress-relieving activities like yoga and meditation may help. If you're already living with a mental health disorder, see your doctor regularly and take your recommended medications to help with prevention, as well."
339,"The normal, healthy heart has its own pacemaker that regulates the rate that the heart beats. However, some hearts don't beat regularly. A pacemaker can sometimes correct the problem. A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm. A pacemaker may also be used to treat fainting spells (syncope), congestive heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Pacemakers are implanted just under the skin of the chest during a minor surgical procedure. The pacemaker has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The pulse generator houses the battery and a tiny computer, and resides just under the skin of the chest. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. They send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle, as well as sense the heart's electrical activity. Each impulse causes the heart to contract. The pacemaker may have one to three leads, depending on the type of pacemaker needed to treat your heart problem. There are different types of pacemakers: Single-chamber pacemakers use one lead in the upper chamber (atria) or lower chamber (ventricles) of the right side of the heart. Dual-chamber pacemakers use one lead in the right atrium and one lead in the right ventricle of your heart. Biventricular pacemakers use three leads: one placed in the right atrium, one placed in the right ventricle, and one placed in the left ventricle (via the coronary sinus vein). Your doctor will decide what type of pacemaker you need based on your heart condition. The doctor programs the minimum heart rate. When your heart rate drops below that set rate, your pacemaker generates (fires) an electrical impulse that passes through the lead to the heart muscle. This causes the heart muscle to contract, creating a heartbeat. Pacemakers are also used to treat the following: Bradyarrythmias, which are slow heart rhythms that may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system (such as the SA node, AV node, or HIS- Purkinje system). Heart failure. This type of treatment is called cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) or biventricular pacing. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Syncope (fainting spells). Sex After a Heart Attack As a psychologist who has counseled heart patients for more than 30 years, Wayne Sotile, Ph D, knows exactly how much they worry about sex after a heart attack. "" And if they're not anxious, believe me, their partner is anxious,"" he says. Couples worry about triggering a second heart attack, or even that a patient could die in the bedroom. But Sotile and cardiologists tell Web MD that sex isn't nearly as risky as many patients believe. With a touch of reassurance, heart patients can once... Read the Sex After a Heart Attack article > > Before your procedure to get a pacemaker implanted: Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications 1 to 5 days before the procedure. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetes medications. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the procedure. If you must take medications, take them only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. Pacemakers are implanted two ways: Endocardial approach. This is the most common technique used. A local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication) is given to numb the area. An incision is made in the chest where the leads and pacemaker are inserted. The lead(s) is inserted through the incision and into a vein, then guided to the heart with the aid of the x-ray machine. The lead tip attaches to the heart muscle, while the other end of the lead (attached to the pulse generator) is placed in a pocket created under the skin in the upper chest. Epicardial approach. This technique is more commonly used in children than adults. A surgeon performs this procedure in an operating room. General anesthesia is given to put you to sleep. The surgeon attaches the lead tip to the heart muscle, while the other end of the lead (attached to the pulse generator) is placed in a pocket created under the skin in the abdomen. Although recovery with the epicardial approach is longer than that of the transvenous approach, minimally invasive techniques have enabled shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times. The doctor will determine, which pacemaker implant method is best for you. The endocardial pacemaker implant takes about one to five hours to perform. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous line ( IV) into your arm or hand. This is so you may receive medications and fluids during the procedure. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The monitors allow the doctor and nurse to check your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and other measurements during the pacemaker implant. Your left or right side of your chest will be shaved and cleansed with a special soap. Sterile drapes are used to cover you from your neck to your feet. A strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. The doctor will numb your skin by injecting a local numbing medication. You will feel a pinching or burning feeling at first. Then, it will become numb. Once this occurs, an incision will be made to insert the pacemaker and leads. You may feel a pulling as the doctor makes a pocket in the tissue under your skin for the pacemaker. You should not feel pain. If you do, tell your nurse. After the pocket is made, the doctor will insert the leads into a vein and guide them into position using the X-ray machine. After the leads are in place, their function is tested to make sure they can increase your heart rate. This is called ""pacing"" and involves delivering small amounts of energy through the leads into the heart muscle. This causes the heart to contract. When your heart rate increases, you may feel your heart is racing or beating faster. It is very important to tell your doctor or nurse any symptoms you feel. Any pain should be reported immediately. After the leads are tested the doctor will connect them to your pacemaker. Your doctor will determine the rate of your pacemaker and other settings. The final pacemaker settings are done after the implant using a special device called a programmer. You may be admitted to the hospital overnight. The nurses will monitor your heart rate and rhythm. You will be shown how to care for your wound. Keep your wound clean and dry. Look at your wound every day to make sure it is healing. Call your doctor if you notice: Increased drainage, bleeding, or oozing from the insertion site Increased opening of the incision Redness around the site Warmth along the site Increased body temperature (fever or chills) Your pacemaker settings will be checked before you leave the hospital. You will receive a temporary ID card that tells you: The type of pacemaker and leads you have. The date of the pacemaker implant. The name of the doctor who implanted the pacemaker. Within three months, you will receive a permanent card from the pacemaker company. Carry this card with you at all times in case you need medical attention at another hospital. Do not lift objects that weigh more than 10 pounds. Do not hold your arm above shoulder level for three weeks. Avoid activities that require pushing or pulling heavy objects, such as shoveling the snow or mowing the lawn. Stop any activity before you become overtired. Avoid golfing, tennis, and swimming for 6 weeks after the procedure. Try to walk as much as possible for exercise. Ask your doctor when you can resume more strenuous activities. Your doctor will tell you when you can go back to work, usually within a week after you go home. If you have the flexibility at your job, ease back to your regular works schedule. Electric blankets, heating pads, and microwave ovens can be used and will not interfere with the function of your pacemaker. Cell phones should not be placed directly against the chest or on the same side as your pacemaker. You will need to avoid strong electric or magnetic fields, such as some industrial equipment; ham radios; high intensity radio waves (found near large electrical generators, power plants, or radiofrequency transmission towers); and arc resistance welders. Do not undergo any tests that require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). When going through airport security, show your pacemaker card without going through the screening machine because the pacemaker will set off the security alarms. Your doctor or nurse can provide more information about what types of equipment may interfere with your pacemaker. If you have concerns about your job or activities, ask your doctor. Pacemakers may last five to 10 years and sometimes longer, depending on how often they are used. When the battery becomes low, it will need to be changed. A complete pacemaker check should be done six weeks after your pacemaker is implanted. This follow-up appointment is critical, because adjustments will be made that will prolong the life of your pacemaker. Then your pacemaker should be checked every three months on the telephone to evaluate battery function. Your nurse will explain how to check your pacemaker using the telephone transmitter. Once or twice a year you will need a more complete exam. If you have a biventricular pacemaker, you may need to visit the doctor's office or hospital more frequently to make sure your device is working properly and the settings do not need to be adjusted."
340,"Want the lean look and elegant stance of a yoga or Pilates teacher? It all starts with good posture. The best way to improve your posture is to focus on exercises that strengthen your core -- the abdominal and low back muscles that connect to your spine and pelvis. Some of these muscles move your torso by flexing, extending, or rotating your spine. Others stabilize your pelvis and spine in a natural, neutral position. Old-style sit-ups used only a few of these muscles, often with jerky momentum. Today's yoga, Pilates, and core fitness programs target your entire core with slow, controlled movements to get the most out of your workout. Make these posture-boosting exercises a regular part of your routine. Remember to exhale strongly and pull in your core muscles as you work -- a key principle in both Pilates and yoga. 1. Core Stabilizer: Single Leg Extension Why It's Good for You: This move trains your core muscles to work together to stabilize your pelvis. Starting Position: Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and hands behind your head. Press your low back into the floor, and curl your head up off the floor. The Move: Exhale strongly and pull your navel in and up toward your spine. Slowly pull one knee into your chest, keeping your low back pressed to the floor, while extending your other leg straight at about a 45-degree angle off the floor. Keep your abdominals pulled in and your low back on the floor. If your low back arches off the floor, extend your leg higher toward the ceiling. Switch legs. Start with five to 10 extensions on each side. Increase the Intensity: Pull both knees into your chest, then extend both legs straight at about a 45-degree angle, using your core to keep your low back on the floor. Or, as you extend your legs, extend both arms overhead, reaching in the opposite direction from your legs. 2. The New Crunch Why It's Good for You: Also called a âcurl-up,â this exercise works the rectus abdominis (the six-pack muscle) and obliques (which run diagonally around your waist and rotate your torso). Starting Position: Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Press your low back into the floor. Place your hands behind your head, or reach your arms toward your knees if it doesn't create too much tension in your neck. The Move: Exhale strongly and pull your navel in and up toward your spine. Curl your head and shoulders slowly off the floor. Hold, then slowly lower back down. Repeat three times Increase the Intensity: Extend one leg straight at a 45-degree angle toward the ceiling. Or hold both legs off the floor, knees bent, with your shins parallel to the floor 3. Pilates Roll- Up / Yoga Sit- Up Why It's Good for You: This move works the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis (the deepest core muscles that wrap around your waist like a corset and pull your abdomen inward and upward toward your spine.) Starting Position: Lie on your back with your legs straight, your feet flexed, and your arms reaching overhead on the floor. Press your low back into the floor. The Move: Exhale strongly and pull your navel in and up toward your spine. Roll up in slow motion, reaching your arms off the floor, then your shoulders and head, rolling up one vertebra at a time until you're sitting up with your abdominals still pulled in. Slowly roll back down. Repeat three to five times, adding more as your core gets stronger. Increase the Intensity: Cross your arms over your chest as you roll up. 4. Crossover Why It's Good for You: This exercise works all the core muscles, focusing on the obliques. Starting Position: Lie on your back with your hands behind your head, your chest lifted off the floor, knees pulled into your chest. Keep your low back pressed into the floor. The Move: Exhale strongly and pull your navel in and up toward your spine. Pull one knee into your chest while extending your other leg straight and rotating your torso toward the bent knee. Slowly switch legs, pulling the other knee into your chest and rotating your torso toward it while extending the opposite leg off the floor. Repeat five to 10 times, adding more as your core gets stronger Increase the Intensity: The closer your straight leg is to the floor, the harder the work for your core. Try extending your leg just inches off the floor, making sure your lower back stays on the floor. 5. Cobra Pose: Back Extension Why It's Good for You: This move strengthens the erector spinae (the back muscles that extend your spine and prevent slouching) and other low back muscles. Starting Position: Lie on your stomach with palms flat on the floor near your ribs. Extend your legs straight behind you, and press the tops of your feet into the floor. The Move: Exhale strongly and pull your abdominal muscles in and up toward your spine. Lengthen out through your spine and slowly raise your head and chest off the floor, using only your back muscles. Do not push down into your arms to press up. Keep your hip bones on the floor, and gaze down at the floor to relax your neck muscles. Slowly lower back down. Repeat three to five times, adding more as your lower back gets stronger Increase the Intensity: Reach your arms long beside your head. Keep your elbows straight. 6. Plank Pose Why It's Good for You: This exercise strengthens the obliques and transverse abdominis, as well as your shoulder and back muscles. Starting Position: Begin on your hands and knees with your palms under your shoulders. Extend both legs straight behind you, toes tucked under, into a position like the top of a pushup. Pull your abdominal muscles in to prevent a ""sway back,"" and gaze down at the floor. The Move: Hold the plank until you start feeling fatigued. Rest and then repeat. Keep your abdominals pulled in and up so your low back doesn't sag as you exhale. Increase the Intensity: Balance on your forearms instead of your hands. Pull your abdominal muscles in and up toward your spine as you exercise. Work with slow, controlled movements, breathing evenly, without holding your breath. Tailor your number of repetitions and sets to your current level of core fitness. If you have mild back pain, core-strengthening exercises may improve posture, ease symptoms, and prevent future pain. If you have severe back pain or injury, are out of shape, or have any medical problems, talk to your doctor before you start any exercise program. Some exercises may not be recommended. Stop doing any activity that causes pain or makes pain worse."
341,"Imagine you develop an infection -- anything from a typical urinary tract infection to tuberculosis. Now imagine there's nothing doctors can do. The discovery of antibiotics changed medicine in the 20th century. Today, they're widely used to treat infections caused by bacteria. More than 150 million prescriptions are written for antibiotics in the U. S. each year. But bacteria are starting to adapt to the drugs and are becoming harder to kill. That's called antibiotic resistance. Some bacteria can naturally resist certain kinds of antibiotics. Others can become resistant if their genes change or they get drug-resistant genes from other bacteria. The longer and more often antibiotics are used, the less effective they are against those bacteria. Antibiotic resistance has spread around the world, and it's making some diseases, such as meningitis or pneumonia, more difficult to treat. You might need stronger, more expensive drugs. Or you might need to take them longer. You also might not get well as quickly, or you could develop other health issues. Each year, an estimated 2 million people in the U. S. develop infections that are resistant to antibiotics. In some cases, these infections result in death. Resistance also makes it more difficult to care for people with chronic diseases. Some people need medical treatments like chemotherapy, surgery, or dialysis, and they sometimes take antibiotics to help reduce the risk of infection. In 2015, the White House created a National Action Plan for Combatting Antibiotic Resistance. Its recommendations include: Scientists should step up the development of new antibiotics and vaccines as well as diagnostic tests to identify drug-resistant bacteria. Public health officials should monitor antibiotic resistance and track its spread. Doctors should help stop unnecessary antibiotic use and develop safer practices in hospitals and clinics. Farmers should stop giving animals antibiotics needed to treat diseases in people. To help fight antibiotic resistance and protect yourself against infection: Don't take antibiotics unless you're certain you need them. An estimated 30% of the millions of prescriptions written each year are not needed. Always ask your doctor if antibiotics will really help. For illnesses caused by viruses -- common colds, bronchitis, and many ear and sinus infections -- they won't. Finish your pills. Take your entire prescription exactly as directed. Do it even if you start feeling better. If you stop before the infection is completely wiped out, those bacteria are more likely to become drug-resistant. Get vaccinated. Immunizations can protect you against some diseases that are treated with antibiotics. They include tetanus and whooping cough. Stay safe in the hospital. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are commonly found in hospitals. Make sure your caregivers wash their hands properly. Also, ask how to keep surgical wounds free of infection."
342,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the U. S, second only to skin cancer. Improved screening tests and treatment techniques are saving lives. The most common screening method is the mammogram. It uses X-rays to scan your breasts. The images are checked for anything irregular, and doctors also look for changes from previous tests. The images were recorded on film for many years. But now digital mammograms can store and analyze the information using a computer. The method of getting mammogram images is the same for both types. A technician positions your breast between two plates, and flattens and compresses it. She then takes images of your breast from top to bottom and side to side. It can be uncomfortable, but the entire process takes about 20 minutes. Film mammograms are saved on hard files. With the digital kind, the X-rays are turned into electric signals that can be stored in a computer. It's similar to the way digital cameras take and store pictures. The two different types are well-matched in accuracy, research suggests. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 49,000 women with no known signs of breast cancer, and it compared digital mammograms to film mammograms. The women were screened using both types of tests. Breast cancer was found in 335 of the women. The researchers determined that digital mammograms did a better job with detection for three groups of women: Under age 50 Had dense breasts Hadn't yet gone through menopause, or had been in menopause less than a year If you fall into one of these groups, talk with your doctor about having a digital mammogram. More analysis. Because digital mammograms are stored electronically, they can be analyzed by computers as well as by radiologists. Easier second opinions. They can easily be sent electronically for analysis. More to see. The images can be manipulated for better clarity and visibility. Film mammogram can't. Lower average radiation dosage. Digital mammograms often take more views of each breast than the film kind -- but they use about 25% less radiation. That's because smaller areas of the breast are imaged in each view. Easier to store. The digital images stay on a computer. The film type produce bulky sets of films. Most mammogram facilities in the U. S. now have digital capabilities. But If you can't get the digital kind, that doesn't mean you should skip getting a film mammogram. Also, 3- D mammography is available at some centers. If you're at high risk for getting breast cancer, you might also benefit from an annual MRI in addition to a yearly mammogram."
343,"Eating less and moving more are the basics of weight loss that lasts. For some people, prescription weight loss drugs may help.  You'll still need to focus on diet and exercise while taking these drugs, and they're not for everyone. Doctors usually prescribe them only if your BMI is 30 or higher, or if it's at least 27 and you have a condition that may be related to your weight, like type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. Here's what you should know about the most common prescription weight loss drugs: orlistat, Belviq, Contrave, Saxenda, phentermine, and Qsymia. Before you get a weight loss drug prescription, tell your doctor about your medical history. That includes any allergies or other conditions you have; medicines or supplements you take (even if they're herbal or natural); and whether you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant soon. How it works: Blocks your body from absorbing about a third of the fat you eat. When a doctor prescribes orlistat, it's called Xenical. If you get it without a prescription, it's called Alli, which has half of Xenical's dose. Approved for long-term use? Yes. Side effects include abdominal cramping, passing gas, leaking oily stool, having more bowel movements, and not being able to control bowel movements. These side effects are generally mild and temporary. But they may get worse if you eat high-fat foods. Rare cases of severe liver injury have been reported in people taking orlistat, but it's not certain that the drug caused those problems. What else you should know: You should be on a low-fat diet (less than 30% of your daily calories from fat) before taking orlistat. Also, take a multivitamin at least 2 hours before or after taking orlistat, because the drug temporarily makes it harder for your body to absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K. Orlistat is the only drug of its kind that's approved in the U. S. All other prescription weight loss drugs curb your appetite, including the following. How it works: Curbs your appetite. Approved for long-term use? Yes. Side effects: The most common side effects in people who don't have diabetes include headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, and constipation. The most common side effects in those who have diabetes are low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), headache, back pain, cough, and fatigue. People taking some depression medications with lorcaserin need to be monitored very closely for a rare but serious reaction that includes fever and confusion. Women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant shouldn't take lorcaserin. What else you should know: If you don't lose 5% of your weight after 12 weeks of taking lorcaserin, your doctor may tell you to stop taking it, because it's unlikely to work for you, the FDA says. How it works: Contrave is a combination of two FDA-approved drugs, naltrexone and bupropion, in an extended-release formula. Naltrexone is approved to treat alcohol and opioid dependence. Bupropion is approved to treat depression, seasonal affective disorder, and help people stop smoking. Approved for long-term use? Yes. Side effects: The most common side effects include nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, and dry mouth. Contrave has a boxed warning about the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors associated with bupropion. The warning also notes that serious neuropsychiatric issues linked to bupropion have been reported. Contrave can cause seizures and must not be used in patients who have seizure disorders. The drug can also increase blood pressure and heart rate. What else you should know: If you don't lose 5% of your weight after 12 weeks of taking Contrave, your doctor may tell you to stop taking it, because it's unlikely to work for you, the FDA says. How it works: Liraglutide is a higher dose of the type 2 diabetes drug Victoza. It mimics an intestinal hormone that tells the brain your stomach is full. Approved for long-term use? Yes. Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, low blood pressure, and increased appetite. Serious side effects can include raised heart rate, pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, kidney problems, and suicidal thoughts. Liraglutide has been shown in studies to cause thyroid tumors in animals, but it is not yet known if it can cause thyroid cancer in humans. What else you should know: If you don't lose 4% of your weight after 16 weeks of taking Liraglutide, your doctor may tell you to stop taking it, because it's unlikely to work for you, the FDA says. How it works: Curbs your appetite. Your doctor may prescribe this under the names including Adipex or Suprenza. Approved for long-term use? No. It's approved for short-term use (a few weeks) only. Side effects can be serious, such as raising your blood pressure or causing heart palpitations, restlessness, dizziness, tremor, insomnia, shortness of breath, chest pain, and trouble doing activities you've been able to do. Less serious side effects include dry mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting. As with some other appetite suppressants, there's a risk of becoming dependent upon the drug. Don't take it late in the evening, as it may cause insomnia. If you take insulin for diabetes, let your doctor know before you take phentermine, as you may need to adjust your insulin dose. You should not take phentermine if you have a history of heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. You also shouldn't take it if you have glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or a history of drug abuse, or if you are pregnant or nursing. What else you should know: Phentermine is an amphetamine. Because of the risk of addiction or abuse, such stimulant drugs are ""controlled substances,"" which means they need a special type of prescription. How it works: Curbs your appetite. Qsymia combines phentermine with the seizure/migraine drug topiramate. Topiramate causes weight loss in several ways, including helping you feel full, making foods taste less appealing, and burning more calories. Approved for long-term use? Yes. Qsymia has much lower amounts of phentermine and topiramate than when these drugs are given alone. Side effects: The most common side effects are tingling hands and feet, dizziness, altered sense of taste, insomnia, constipation, and dry mouth. Serious side effects include certain birth defects (cleft lip and cleft palate), faster heart rate, suicidal thoughts or actions, and eye problems that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated. Women who might become pregnant should get a pregnancy test before taking Qsymia, and should use birth control and get monthly pregnancy tests while on the drug. You also shouldn't take Qsymia if you have glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, or stroke. Get regular checks of your heart when starting the drug or increasing the dose. What else you should know: If you don't lose at least 3% of your weight after 12 weeks on Qsymia, the FDA recommends that you stop taking it or that your doctor increase your dose for the next 12 weeks -- and if that doesn't work, you should gradually stop taking it."
344,"The bladder is a hollow, flexible pouch in your pelvis. Its main job is to store urine before it leaves your body. Your kidneys make pee. Tubes called ureters carry the pee from your kidneys to your bladder. When you use the bathroom, the muscles in your bladder push the urine out through a tube called the urethra. You get bladder cancer when bladder cells become abnormal and grow out of control. Over time, a tumor forms. It can spread to nearby lymph nodes and other organs. In severe cases, it can spread to distant parts of your body, including your bones, lungs, or liver. Bladder cancer is rare. It accounts for just 5% of all new cancers in the U. S. Doctors aren't sure. But they do know that several things increase your risk for the disease. They include: Genetic makeup, race, and family history. Bladder cancer is most common in white men over age 55. If you or someone in your immediate family (parents or siblings) has had cancer of the bladder or the urinary tract before, you're more likely to get it. Chronic bladder inflammation. If you have bladder infections that keep coming back or another condition that causes your bladder to be irritated for long periods of time, you stand a better chance of getting bladder cancer. Smoking . Every time you inhale tobacco fumes, you're taking in all kinds of harmful chemicals. Research shows that smoking is the cause of about 50% of all bladder cancers. Working around harmful chemicals. People who work in certain industries (painters, machinists, printers, hairdressers, and truck drivers, among others) may be exposed to harmful chemicals for long periods of time. This can increase their risk of disease. Taking certain diabetes medications. If you've taken pioglitazone ( Actos) for more than a year, you may stand a greater chance of getting bladder cancer. Other diabetes meds that contain pioglitazone ( Actoplus Met and Duetact) can also raise your risk. Prior chemo or radiation treatment. If you've had radiation therapy to your pelvis, you're more likely to develop bladder cancer. The same is true if you've taken the chemo medication cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan) for a long time. The 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer is about 77%. That means that about 7 out of 10 people who are diagnosed with the disease will still be alive 5 years later. But that's just an estimate. Your outcome is based on your unique situation. That includes things like your age, overall health, how early the cancer was found, and how well it responds to treatment."
345," A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form. "" Root canal"" is the term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal. The tooth's nerve lies within the root canal. A tooth's nerve is not vitally important to a tooth's health and function after the tooth has emerged through the gums. Its only function is sensory -- to provide the sensation of hot or cold. The presence or absence of a nerve will not affect the day-to-day functioning of the tooth. When a tooth's nerve tissue or pulp is damaged, it breaks down and bacteria begin to multiply within the pulp chamber. The bacteria and other decayed debris can cause an infection or abscessed tooth. An abscess is a pus-filled pocket that forms at the end of the roots of the tooth. An abscess occurs when the infection spreads all the way past the ends of the roots of the tooth. In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause: Embed Asset Override Swelling that may spread to other areas of the face, neck, or head Bone loss around the tip of the root Drainage problems extending outward from the root. A hole can occur through the side of the tooth with drainage into the gums or through the cheek with drainage into the skin. A tooth's nerve and pulp can become irritated, inflamed, and infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth, and/or large fillings, a crack or chip in the tooth, or trauma to the face. A root canal requires one or more office visits and can be performed by a dentist or endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist who specializes in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and injuries of the human dental pulp or the nerve of the tooth. The choice of which type of dentist to use depends to some degree on the difficulty of the root canal procedure needed in your particular tooth and the general dentist's comfort level in working on your tooth. Your dentist will discuss who might be best suited to perform the work in your particular case. The first step in the procedure is to take an X-ray to see the shape of the root canals and determine if there are any signs of infection in a surrounding bone. Your dentist or endodontist will then use local anesthesia to numb the area near the tooth. Anesthesia may not be necessary, since the nerve is dead, but most dentists still anesthetize the area to make the patient more relaxed and at ease. Next, to keep the area dry and free of saliva during treatment, your dentist will place a rubber dam (a sheet of rubber) around the tooth. An access hole will then be drilled into the tooth. The pulp along with bacteria, the decayed nerve tissue and related debris is removed from the tooth. The cleaning out process is accomplished using root canal files. A series of these files of increasing diameter are each subsequently placed into the access hole and worked down the full length of the tooth to scrape and scrub the sides of the root canals. Water or sodium hypochlorite is used periodically to flush away the debris. Embed Asset Override Once the tooth is thoroughly cleaned, it is sealed. Some dentists like to wait a week before sealing the tooth. For instance, if there is an infection, your dentist may put a medication inside the tooth to clear it up. Others may choose to seal the tooth the same day it is cleaned out. If the root canal is not completed on the same day, a temporary filling is placed in the exterior hole in the tooth to keep out contaminants like saliva and food between appointments. At the next appointment, to fill the interior of the tooth, a sealer paste and a rubber compound called gutta percha is placed into the tooth's root canal. To fill the exterior access hole created at the beginning of treatment, a filling is placed. The final step may involve further restoration of the tooth. Because a tooth that needs a root canal often is one that has a large filling or extensive decay or other weakness, a crown, crown and post, or other restoration often needs to be placed on the tooth to protect it, prevent it from breaking, and restore it to full function. Your dentist will discuss the need for any additional dental work with you. Root canal procedures have the reputation of being painful. Actually, most people report that the procedure itself is no more painful than having a filling placed. For the first few days following the completion of a root canal, the tooth may feel sensitive due to natural tissue inflammation, especially if there was pain or infection before the procedure. This sensitivity or discomfort usually can be controlled with over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve). Most patients can return to their normal activities the next day. Until your root canal procedure is completely finished -- that is to say, the permanent filling is in place and/or the crown, it's wise to minimize chewing on the tooth under repair. This step will help avoid recontamination of the interior of the tooth and also may prevent a fragile tooth from breaking before the tooth can be fully restored. Embed Asset Override As far as oral health care is concerned, brush, floss, and use an antiseptic mouthwash as you regularly would and see your dentist at normally scheduled intervals. Root canal treatment is highly successful; the procedure has more than a 95% success rate. Many teeth fixed with a root canal can last a lifetime. Also, because the final step of the root canal procedure is application of a restoration such as a crown or a filling, it will not be obvious to onlookers that a root canal was performed. Despite your dentist's best efforts to clean and seal a tooth, new infections might emerge after a root canal. Among the likely reasons for this include: Embed Asset Override More than the normally anticipated number of root canals in a tooth (leaving one of them uncleaned) An undetected crack in the root of a tooth A defective or inadequate dental restoration that has allowed bacteria to get past the restoration into the inner aspects of the tooth and recontaminate the area A breakdown of the inner sealing material over time, allowing bacteria to recontaminate the inner aspects of the tooth Sometimes retreatment can be successful, other times endodontic surgery must be tried in order to save the tooth. The most common endodontic surgical procedure is an apicoectomy or root-end resection. This procedure relieves the inflammation or infection in the bony area around the end of your tooth that continues after endodontic treatment. In this procedure, the gum tissue is opened, the infected tissue is removed, and sometimes the very end of the root is removed. A small filling may be placed to seal the root canal. The cost varies depending on how severe the problem is and the tooth affected. Many dental insurance policies at least partially cover endodontic treatment. A ballpark estimate for the root canal treatment itself (not including a dental restoration following the procedure) performed by a general dentist could range from $500 to $1,000 for an incisor and $800 to $1,500 for a molar. The fees charged by endodontists could be up to 50% higher. Saving your natural teeth is the very best option, if possible. Your natural teeth allow you to eat a wide variety of foods necessary to maintain proper nutrition. The root canal procedure is the treatment of choice. The only alternative to a root canal procedure is having the tooth extracted and replaced with a bridge, implant, or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting. These alternatives not only are more expensive than a root canal procedure but require more treatment time and additional procedures to adjacent teeth and supporting tissues. Embed Asset Override Since some of the reasons why the nerve of a tooth and its pulp become inflamed and infected are due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth and/or large fillings, following good oral hygiene practices (brushing twice a day, flossing at least once a day, and scheduling regular dental visits) may reduce the need for a root canal procedure. Trauma resulting from a sports-related injury can be reduced by wearing a mouth guard."
346," Vaginal discharge serves an important housekeeping function in the female reproductive system. Fluid made by glands inside the vagina and cervix carries away dead cells and bacteria. This keeps the vagina clean and helps prevent infection. Most of the time, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal. The amount can vary, as can odor and color (which can range from clear to a milky white-ish), depending on the time in your menstrual cycle. For example, there will be more discharge when you're ovulating, breastfeeding, or sexually aroused. It may smell different when you're pregnant or you've been letting your personal hygiene slide. None of those changes is cause for alarm. However, if the color, smell, or consistency seems quite different than usual, especially if you also have vaginal itching or burning, you could be dealing with an infection or other condition. Any change in the vagina's balance of normal bacteria can affect the smell, color, or discharge texture. These are a few of the things that can upset that balance: Antibiotic or steroid use Bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial infection more common in pregnant women or women who have multiple sexual partners Birth control pills Cervical cancer Chlamydia or gonorrhea ( STDs), sexually transmitted infections Diabetes Douches, scented soaps or lotions, bubble bath Pelvic infection after surgery Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) Trichomoniasis, a parasitic infection typically contracted and caused by having unprotected sex Vaginal atrophy, the thinning and drying out of the vaginal walls during menopause Vaginitis, irritation in or around the vagina Yeast infections See the chart below to learn more about what a particular type of discharge might mean. Types of Abnormal Discharge and Their Possible Causes Type of Discharge What It Might Mean Other Symptoms Bloody or brown Irregular menstrual cycles, or less often, cervical or endometrial cancer Abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain Cloudy or yellow Gonorrhea Bleeding between periods, urinary incontinence, pelvic pain Frothy, yellow or greenish with a bad smell Trichomoniasis Pain and itching while urinating Pink Shedding of the uterine lining after childbirth (lochia) Thick, white, cheesy Yeast infection Swelling and pain around the vulva, itching, painful sexual intercourse White, gray, or yellow with fishy odor Bacterial vaginosis Itching or burning, redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva The doctor will start by taking a health history and asking about your symptoms. Questions may include: When did the abnormal discharge begin? What color is the discharge? Is there any smell? Do you have any itching, pain, or burning in or around the vagina? Do you have more than one sexual partner? Do you douche? The doctor may take a sample of the discharge or do a Pap test to collect cells from your cervix for further examination. How you are treated will depend on what's causing the problem. For example, yeast infections are usually treated with antifungal medications inserted into the vagina in cream or gel form. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotic pills or creams. Trichomoniasis is usually treated with the drug metronidazole ( Flagyl) or tinidazole ( Tindamax). Here are some tips for preventing vaginal infections that can lead to abnormal discharge: Keep the vagina clean by washing regularly with a gentle, mild soap and warm water. Never use scented soaps and feminine products or douche. Also avoid feminine sprays and bubble baths. After going to the bathroom, always wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from getting into the vagina and causing an infection. Wear 100% cotton underpants, and avoid overly tight clothing."
347,"Varicose veins are swollen, twisted, blue or purple veins that can be seen under the skin's surface. They result from a weakening in the blood vessel wall or from faulty valves. They can show up anywhere on the body but most often appear on the legs or pelvic area. Spider veins are a smaller version of varicose veins. They affect the capillaries, the body's smallest blood vessels. Spider veins, which are red or blue, look like a spider's web or tree branch, and they tend to appear on the legs and face. Although varicose veins and spider veins are common, many people find them unsightly. Varicose veins can also cause unpleasant symptoms, such as tiredness, itching, burning, throbbing, tingling, heaviness, soreness, or swelling in the legs. Sometimes, lifestyle changes can improve symptoms. Some things you can try include: Not standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. Losing extra weight to improve blood flow and ease pressure on your veins. Not wearing tight clothing, especially around your waist, upper thighs, and legs. Tight clothing can worsen varicose veins. Not wearing high heels for long periods. Shoes with lower heels can help tone calf muscles and improve blood flow through the veins. Elevating legs while sitting, resting, or sleeping -- ideally, to a level above your heart. Avoiding crossing your legs at your knees and ankles. Doing physical activities that move your legs, which will improve muscle tone. If your doctor recommends them, consider wearing compression stockings. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. That keeps blood from pooling in veins and also curbs leg swelling. You can buy compression stockings in pharmacies and medical supply stores. Usually, varicose veins don't cause medical problems. But in some people, they can lead to pain that interferes with walking or standing. They can also cause blood clots, skin ulcers, infections, and other troubles. If lifestyle changes don't help, if varicose veins become more severe, or if you're bothered by the appearance of your varicose or spider veins, talk to your doctor about what medical treatments are available. Be aware, though, that although treatments can help, they won't prevent new varicose veins from forming. Sclerotherapy Sclerotherapy is most often used for smaller varicose veins and spider veins. This procedure can eliminate the pain and discomfort of varicose veins and prevent complications, such as ulcers or vein bleeding. It may also be used simply to improve appearance. With sclerotherapy, doctors inject a liquid chemical directly into a varicose vein to close it off. The chemical irritates and scars the inside of the vein, making it collapse. Over the course of six months, the vein disappears. You may need several treatments to close off a vein entirely. Typically, treatments are done every 4 to 6 weeks. Foam sclerotherapy is a variation in which a foaming agent is mixed into the injection. The foaming agent moves blood out of the vein so that the chemical can come into better contact with the vein wall. During sclerotherapy treatments, you may feel small needle pricks as your doctor injects the veins. You can also experience temporary muscle cramping from normal saline sclerotherapy injections. Afterward, you'll need to wear medical-grade support stockings for a few weeks. Some temporary reactions may occur, including slight leg or foot swelling, mild bruising or soreness, itching, or redness. Rarely, sclerotherapy can cause development of small clusters of red blood vessels, brown pigmentation, and skin ulcerations around the treated veins. Laser and light therapy Laser and pulse light therapy can heat blood vessels to shrink them. Laser therapy applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein to make it shrink and fade away. For veins to be treated successfully, several sessions may be required, usually at six week intervals. Laser therapy is most effective for small varicose veins and spider veins, but lasers are also used in a different procedure called âendovenous ablation therapyâ to treat larger varicose veins. Doctors may also use laser therapy as an additional treatment after sclerotherapy, endovenous therapy, or surgery for larger varicose veins. Another treatment option, Photoderm or intense pulsed light therapy ( IPL), uses high-intensity pulsed light to shrink certain sizes of varicose veins and small spider veins. IPL differs from laser therapy, which uses a single emitted wavelength, by emitting a spectrum of light. Photoderm or IPL may help when sclerotherapy or laser therapy doesn't work. Endovenous ablation therapy In this procedure, doctors close off varicose veins by using lasers or high-frequency radio waves within the vein to create intense heat. Your doctor will make a tiny cut near the vein and insert a small catheter. A device at the tip of the catheter heats up the inside of the vessel and closes it off. Compared to an older procedure called vein stripping and ligation, in which veins are tied shut and removed through small cuts in the skin, ablation therapy closes off varicose veins but leaves them in place, resulting in minimal bleeding and bruising. This therapy offers similar results in terms of improving appearance and symptoms. But people who have it feel less pain and get back to normal activities faster than those who undergo vein stripping and ligation. Endovenous ablation therapy is minimally invasive and generally safe and complication-free. There are, though, risks, including infection, damage to the blood vessel, inflammation of the vein, and, rarely, heat damage to nerves, although this typically goes away in a short time. In extremely rare cases, blood clots that form in the veins can travel to the lungs. Endoscopic vein surgery Typically, endoscopic vein surgery is used only when varicose veins become severe enough to cause skin ulcers or sores. Your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near the vein and use a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. Then he or she will use a surgical device at the camera's end to close the vein. Ambulatory phlebectomy Ambulatory phlebectomy removes varicose veins closest to the surface of the skin through slit-like incisions. You'll remain awake during the procedure, but the area around the vein will be numbed. It's an outpatient procedure, meaning there is no overnight stay. First, the doctor will outline or mark the vein to be removed, then inject local anesthesia into the skin. Then he or she will make a tiny cut and use a surgical instrument or a large needle to hook the vein through the opening. Next, he or she will remove the vein segment by segment. Afterward, you'll need to wear compression stockings for at least one week. An enhanced version called transilluminated power phlebectomy involves fewer cuts and less pain, bleeding, and scarring. Your doctor will insert a fiber optic light under your skin while at the same time injecting a saline and local anesthetic mixture. This makes a silhouette of the veins to guide placement of an instrument that cuts the vein into small pieces and suctions them out. Vein stripping and ligation Vein stripping and ligation, which involves tying veins shut and removing them through small cuts in your skin, is usually performed only in severe cases of varicose veins. Vein stripping and ligation takes about two to three hours and is usually done in an outpatient setting. Full recovery takes about one to two weeks. Although the procedure is generally safe, risks include infection at the incision site, bruising, or irritation of a nerve that runs by the veins that are stripped."
348,"Having adult ADHD means your strengths and weaknesses may differ from those of other people. It might be harder for you to stay focused and organized or to finish tasks on time. This can create challenges for you at work. But some jobs can be a better match for your ADHD. The key is to pick a career that makes the best use of your skills and where your challenges won't create major issues. You can keep a few things in mind as you consider your future career: Everyone does better in a job that sparks her interest and keeps her motivated. That's especially true if you have ADHD. If you grow bored and frustrated easily, it'll be harder for you to stay on track at work. Before you pick a career, make three lists: what you're good at, what you like to do, and what someone else will pay you to do. Your ideal job should hit all three categories. ADHD symptoms can differ from person to person. The disorder can make you restless and easily distracted. Or it can make you so focused on a task that it's hard for you to shift your attention to other things. The trick is to seek jobs where your ADHD traits may be your strengths: 1. Aim for originality. Research shows that people with ADHD are often creative. It might be easier for you to think up unique ways to solve problems. So jobs that call for original ideas and innovative thinking can be a natural fit. Sample jobs: Artists, inventors, musicians, designers, builders, teachers, and advertising professionals 2. Work for yourself. To start your own business, you need to be able to take risks, work independently, and stay creative and committed. These happen to be common traits among those with ADHD. But the day-to-day duties of running a company, such as bookkeeping, also require you to be organized. If that's not your strong suit, it can be smart to partner with or hire people who can handle those tasks. 3. Go at a fast pace. People with ADHD tend to get bored or distracted easily. The upside is that you may thrive in jobs with constant change and a quick pace. When every day at work feels different, you may feel more engaged and interested. Sample jobs: Firefighters, police officers, paramedics, emergency room doctors and nurses, and television producers 4. Stay social. Some people with ADHD thrive in social settings. If you're one of them, consider a career based on relationships, such as working with clients or students. Sample jobs: Salesperson, teacher, and public relations professional If you get bored easily or chafe under routine tasks, you may need to think twice about working for a corporation where following rules is important or a job that involves lots of tedious paperwork. Treatment, such as behavioral therapy and medication, can help you keep your ADHD symptoms in check. Even so, it's important to play to your strengths when it comes to your career. On the job hunt? Take the time to learn about different careers. Interview someone who has a job you're interested in. You may want to shadow her for a day to get a close-up sense of her responsibilities. Remember that the specifics of the job matter. For example, you may be interested in social work to help others. But some of these positions involve piles of paperwork. When you do your research, you can learn what types of social work jobs best suit your talents. If you feel the need for extra insight, consider working with a career coach, psychologist, or a social worker with training in job counseling. They could help match you with potential employers."
349,"Smoking is bad for everyone, and it's especially risky if you have diabetes. The nicotine in cigarettes makes your blood vessels harden and narrow, curbing blood flow around your body. And since diabetes makes you more likely to get heart disease, you definitely don't want the extra risk that comes from smoking. No matter how much or how long you have smoked, quitting helps your health. You'll feel better, look better (since smoking gives you wrinkles before you're old), and you'll save money, too. If you have diabetes, here are some tips to help you quit, based on guidelines from the American Cancer Society. 1. Set a quit date. You don't have to quit immediately. If you know it's more realistic for you to kick the habit after a big event or deadline, make that your quit date. 2. Tell your doctor the date. You'll have built-in support. 3. Make smoking inconvenient. Don't have anything you need to smoke on hand, like ash trays, lighters, or matches. 4. Breathe deeply when you crave a cigarette. Hold your breath for 10 seconds, and then exhale slowly. 5. Spend time in places where you can't smoke because it's banned, such as a library, theater, or museum. 6. Hang out with friends who are also working on kicking the habit. Go to places that don't allow smoking. 7. Reach for low-calorie, good-for-you foods instead of smoking. Choose fresh fruit and crisp, crunchy vegetables. 8. Exercise to ease your stress instead of lighting up. 9. Go decaf. Pass up coffee, soft drinks that have caffeine, and alcohol, as they all can increase the urge to smoke. 10. Keep your hands too busy for cigarettes. Draw, text, type, or knit, for examples. 11. Hack your habits. If you always had a cigarette on your work break, take a walk, talk to a friend, or do something else instead. 12. Wrap a cigarette in a sheet of paper and put a rubber band around it. It will be harder to get one. You'll have time to notice what you're doing and stop. 13. Let your family and friends know you're quitting smoking. Ask for their support. If they smoke, tell them not to do so around you. If they do, leave. 14. Be good to yourself. Do things that you enjoy. You'll notice that you don't need a cigarette to have fun. You can also ask your doctor if nicotine replacement therapy might help. Nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays are four ways to curb cravings for nicotine without a prescription. You wear the patch on your skin, between the neck and waist. It steadily supplies small amounts of nicotine. The gum lets you control the amount of nicotine you get each day. Use it for up to 30 minutes at a time. The nasal spray provides fast relief from nicotine cravings but requires a prescription. The lozenges also control the amount of nicotine you get each day. They dissolve on the tongue. There are also two drugs your doctor can prescribe that may help: Chantix and Zyban. When using any of these products, follow the directions on the package and report any side effects to your doctor. Don't use more than one type, and don't smoke while using nicotine replacement products, since doing so can cause serious side effects."
350,"Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms you might get if you already have a type of cancer called carcinoid tumors. It starts when the tumors release chemicals into your bloodstream. The symptoms can be similar to other illnesses, like asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and menopause. You may have episodes when your skin suddenly gets red and warm, you have trouble breathing, or you have a rapid heartbeat, for example. Carcinoid tumors usually grow in your stomach and intestines, but you can also get them in your lungs, pancreas, or rarely, testicles or ovaries. If you have carcinoid syndrome, it usually means that your cancer has spread to another area, most often your lungs or liver. Although often there's no cure for carcinoid tumors, treatments can help you live longer and better. ( Sometimes it can be surgically removed and cured if found early.) You can also take steps to relieve the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and feel more comfortable. You have control over decisions about your treatment and your life. Find people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. Ask your doctor about support groups, where you can meet people who understand what you're going through. You get carcinoid syndrome when your carcinoid tumors release hormones and proteins into your body. Where your tumors are will determine what substances they make. When the tumors are in your digestive tract, a common place for them to grow, extra hormones usually go into a blood vessel that takes them to your liver, which makes them inactive. If your tumors have spread there, your liver won't be able to do its job of breaking down those hormones. Instead, they may start moving through your bloodstream to affect different parts of your body and cause symptoms. You could get carcinoid syndrome from tumors in the lungs, testes, or ovaries. In those cases, the extra hormones go directly into your bloodstream. People with carcinoid syndrome may have: Skin that turns a pink, red, or purple color Small, widened blood vessels on their face Diarrhea Shortness of breath or wheezing Rapid heart rate Sudden drops in blood pressure Carcinoid syndrome can also cause complications. It's rare, but you could get heart disease. Your heart valves may get thick and leak. Medicine can help, and in some cases you might need surgery. Carcinoid crisis isn't very common, but you might have a severe episode of blushing, breathing trouble, and confusion. This is an emergency that could be life-threatening, so get medical help right away. If your doctor thinks you have carcinoid syndrome, he'll do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have there been times when your skin suddenly got red and felt warm or burning? Do you often have diarrhea? Have you been short of breath? Do you sometimes wheeze? You may also need tests to look for a carcinoid tumor. Urine test. A lab will check the pee that you've collected in containers over a 24-hour period for high levels of hormones or what's left when your body breaks them down. Blood test. This could show telltale substances that tumors release. Imaging tests. A CT scan is a series of X-rays that makes detailed views of the inside of your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your organs. For radionuclide scanning, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive material that the organs in your body absorb. A special camera can spot the material and make pictures that help your doctor find a tumor. Where are the tumors that are causing my carcinoid syndrome? What kinds of tests will I need? What treatment do you recommend? Are there any foods I should avoid? What can I do to control my skin flushing? What other symptoms should I watch out for? To treat carcinoid syndrome, your doctors will need to treat your tumors. You could need just one or a combination of treatments. Medication may help with your related symptoms. Surgery. Doctors may take out an entire organ that has tumors, such as your appendix, or remove only part of an affected area, such as a section of your bowel. Depending on where the tumor is, surgeons may also use an electric current to burn it off or do cryosurgery to freeze it. Another option could be radiofrequency ablation. Your surgeon will use an instrument that sends electrical energy into the tumor to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy. Strong medicines can often kill your cancer cells or slow their growth. Some of these drugs are taken by mouth and others are injected into a vein. Radiation. This treatment can destroy cancer cells or keep them from multiplying. The radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or your doctor may place a small amount of radioactive material inside your body, in or near the tumor. Biologic drugs. This type of treatment, which is also called immunotherapy, strengthens your body's defense system. Doctors inject drugs into your body that help your immune system kill cancer cells. Drug therapy. Injected drugs such as lanreotide and octreotide can help with skin flushing. They may also have a small effect on stopping tumor growth. Diarrhea is a common side effect of carcinoid syndrome and taking telotristat ethyl ( Xermelo) along with lanreotide or octreotide can often give relief. Lanreotide and octreotide work by attaching to carcinoid cells and cutting down on the amount of chemicals they make. Their side effects can include nausea, gallstones, and pain or bruising where you inject it. In some cases, doctors give octreotide with a low-dose injection of a man-made protein called alpha interferon to boost your body's response. You can make changes on your own to curb the effects of carcinoid syndrome. For instance, avoid certain foods and drinks that can trigger symptoms: Alcohol Nuts Cheese Chili peppers Hot liquids It might take some trial and error to see which are triggers for you. Your intestines could have trouble absorbing nutrients, which can lead to weight loss, weakness, and other problems. Try to eat a healthy diet, and ask your doctor if you need to take vitamins or supplements. Treatment might make the cancer that's causing your carcinoid syndrome go away. But the cancer may not be gone completely, or it could return. You may need regular therapy to keep it in check for as long as possible. If your treatment stops working, you can focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care. You may not be able to control your cancer, but you get to say how you'll live your life. You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group, where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. You can learn more about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors on the website of the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation. It also has information about how to join support groups in your area."
351,"Kidney stones are small. They can be as tiny as a grain of salt or as big as a corn kernel. You may not feel anything and never realize you even had one.  But other times, you'll know about it. That's because flushing one out of your body as you pee can hurt, sometimes enormously. That pain you feel as you pass a stone is the main sign that you might be taking in too much minerals and not enough fluids. That imbalance is one reason these pebble-like objects might form. The stones can be brown or yellow, and smooth or rough. When you have a kidney stone, you may not have any symptoms -- that is, until the stone starts to stir. It can move around within your kidney or into your ureter, the tube that connects your kidney to your bladder. Symptoms can vary and can be mild or severe. The most common one is pain. You may feel it: In your side or back, below the ribs -- and the pain can be very intense In your groin and lower abdomen Come and go and get better or worse As you pee -- and you might have to go more often than usual The pain can shift around in your body, from your belly or back down to your groin. This means the stone is making its way from your kidney through the ureter and closer to your bladder. When this happens, you are more likely to feel a burning when you pee or have more urges to go. Sometimes, you can spot the stones after they exit. Surprisingly, the size of your kidney stone doesn't match the degree of pain. Sometimes smaller stones can hurt the worst, while big stones might just give you a dull ache."
352,""" Edema"" is the medical term for swelling. Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help."
353,"In its early stages, breast cancer usually has no symptoms. As a tumor grows, you may notice these signs: A lump in your breast or underarm that doesn't go away after your period. This is often the first symptom of breast cancer. Lumps associated with breast cancer are usually painless, although some may cause a prickly sensation. Lumps are usually visible on a mammogram long before you can see or feel them. Swelling in your armpit or collarbone could mean breast cancer has spread to lymph nodes in that area. This swelling may come before you feel a lump, so let your doctor know if you notice it. Swelling in your breast might signal an aggressive type of cancer called inflammatory breast cancer. Although lumps are usually painless, pain or tenderness can be a sign of breast cancer. This could be a tumor that you can't see or feel. You might notice a difference in the size, contour, texture, or temperature of your breast. A reddish, pitted surface like the skin of an orange could be a sign of advanced breast cancer. It could: Pull inward Get dimpled Burn Itch Develop sores You might notice an unusual discharge from your nipple. It could be clear, bloody, or another color. It's usually caused by benign conditions, but it could be due to cancer, too. This area will feel different from any other part of either breast. One or both breasts develop an abnormal lump or pain that doesn't go away, or look or feel abnormal. The cause often is something other than cancer, but a doctor should check it. You have swollen lymph nodes in your armpits. Any swelling could be from cancer."
354,"When you get a cut, your blood changes from a free-flowing liquid into a clump of gel -- that's a clot -- to stop the bleeding. That's like if a hose could patch itself after it springs a leak. It's a complicated process where platelets, a type of blood cell, and lots of different proteins all jump in at just the right time to plug things up. As the wound heals, your body has another process to break them down. If a clot forms when it's not supposed to -- inside a blood vessel, for example -- you might need a little help to make that happen. When your body senses that you've healed, it calls on a protein called plasmin. Here's the clever part: Plasmin is actually built into the clot itself. It's there the whole time, but it's turned off. It just hangs out and waits. To turn it on, your body releases a substance known as an activator. It wakes up plasmin and tells it to get to work tearing things down. That mainly means breaking up the mesh-like structure that helps the clot work so well. Doctors use different medications based on the type of clot you have: Blood thinners. Also called anticoagulants, these are some of the more common drugs for a deep vein thrombosis ( DVT). That's a blood clot that happens in one of your large veins, usually in your leg. Blood thinners are also used to help prevent clots after a stroke or pulmonary embolism (when a blood clot travels to an artery in your lungs). Blood thinners don't dissolve the clot, but they can stop it from getting bigger and keep new ones from forming. That gives your body time to break up the clot. Different blood thinners work in different ways: Direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs) keep your body from making fibrin, the protein the forms the clot's mesh. Heparin keeps one of your body's key clotting proteins, thrombin, from doing its job. Warfarin ( Coumadin) slows down your liver's ability to make the proteins you need for clotting. Thrombolytics. These clot-busting drugs are used for serious conditions, like a pulmonary embolism. Unlike blood thinners, they do break down the clot. They work by turning on plasmin, which jump-starts your body's natural process for clearing things out. It's not something you feel instantly. A DVT or pulmonary embolism can take weeks or months to totally dissolve. Even a surface clot, which is a very minor issue, can take weeks to go away. If you have a DVT or pulmonary embolism, you typically get more and more relief as the clot gets smaller. The pain and swelling from a DVT usually start to get better within days of treatment. Symptoms from a pulmonary embolism, like shortness of breath or mild pain or pressure in your chest, can linger 6 weeks or more. You might notice them when you're active or even when you take a deep breath. Exercise can help with this. A blood clot puts serious stress on your body. So it's not just about clearing it away, but also giving your body and mind time to recharge. Sometimes a clot can leave behind scars and other damage that can cause problems. Almost half of people who get a DVT may end up with post-thrombotic syndrome. That's where swelling, pain, or skin color changes last much longer. You also may get sores called ulcers. About 4 in 100 people with a pulmonary embolism have long-term lung damage known as pulmonary hypertension. This means you have high blood pressure in your lungs, which can lead to issues like shortness of breath, tiredness, and chest pain."

356,"Previously called transformed migraine headaches, chronic migraine headaches are migraine headaches occurring more than 15 days per month. Most people who get them have had migraines for years, usually since their early teens or before. Daily chronic migraine headaches usually start for people during their 20s and 30s. When chronic migraine headaches begin, you might notice that your headaches are less severe but happen more often, until they happen every day. This change may be linked to daily use of pain relievers. Some people with chronic migraine headaches have severe pain along with nausea and vomiting, much like other types of migraines. Often, it's hard to tell the difference between tension headaches and chronic migraine headaches. Because chronic migraine headaches are tough to diagnose, many people may get the wrong treatment. And because the headaches happen every day, many people tend to take too many pain relievers, both prescription and over-the-counter, using these drugs daily even when they don't have a headache. This means the person could build up a tolerance to the drugs. Plus, taking a lot of pain relievers with caffeine can lead to medication overuse headaches. In many cases, people who have chronic migraine headaches have other health problems, such as high blood pressure and depression, which complicate treatment. If you start to have near daily, throbbing headaches, talk to your doctor. She can help you find out if you're having chronic migraine headaches and help you find safe, effective relief."
357,"When you know the things that can make your IBS symptoms flare up, called triggers, you can make a plan to avoid them. That way, you can work on keeping problems with constipation, diarrhea, belly pain, and bloating to a minimum. IBS is different for everyone, but it may help to keep track of how you react to the most common symptom triggers and learn to prevent them. Some foods can make IBS-related constipation worse, including: Breads and cereals made with refined (not whole) grains Processed foods such as chips and cookies Coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol High-protein diets Dairy products, especially cheese Better Diet Choices for Constipation: Gradually boost your fiber intake by 2 to 3 grams per day until you're eating 25 (for women) or 38 (for men) grams per day. Good sources include whole-grain bread and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Eat a moderate amount of foods that are higher in the sugar substitute sorbitol, such as dried plums and prune juice. Drink plenty of plain water every day. Try ground flaxseed. You can sprinkle it on salads and cooked vegetables. Foods that can make IBS-related diarrhea worse for some people include: Too much fiber, especially the insoluble kind you get in the skin of fruits and vegetables Food and drinks with chocolate, alcohol, caffeine, fructose, or sorbitol Carbonated drinks Large meals Fried and fatty foods Dairy products, especially in people who can't digest the milk sugar lactose, called lactose intolerance Foods with wheat for people who are allergic to or have a bad reaction to gluten. Better Diet Choices for Diarrhea: Eat a moderate amount of soluble fiber. It adds bulk to your stools. Good sources are whole wheat breads, oats, barley, brown rice, whole-grain pasta, the flesh of fruit (not the skin), and dried fruits. Don't eat foods at opposite temperatures, such as ice-cold water and steaming hot soup, in the same meal. Stay away from broccoli, onions, and cabbage. They cause gas, which can make you feel worse. Eat smaller portions. Drink water an hour before or after meals, not while you eat. Talk with your doctor or a dietitian if you think you may have a wheat allergy. To ease symptoms of bloating and gas, try to avoid gassy foods such as beans, Brussels sprouts, wheat germ, raisins, and celery. Stress and anxiety can make IBS symptoms worse. Worries can come from a lot of sources, including: Work Your commute Problems at home Money problems A sense that things are out of your control How to Manage Stress: Choose healthy habits. Eat a well-balanced diet that works for your IBS. Get regular exercise and enough sleep. Do something fun as often as you can. Listen to music, read, shop, or take a walk. Learn better ways to calm down with behavioral therapy. There are a few types: relaxation therapy, biofeedback, hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and psychotherapy. If you feel comfortable, talk to family members, close friends, your boss, or co-workers about your IBS. When they know what's going on, they can support you and better understand how it affects you. Some drugs can trigger constipation or diarrhea. People with IBS may have trouble with: Antibiotics Some antidepressants Medicine made with sorbitol, such as cough syrup How to Choose Better Meds: Talk with your doctor about switching to a drug that won't make your symptoms flare. But ask her before you stop taking your meds. Choose antidepressants wisely. Older ones, called tricyclic antidepressants, can cause constipation. Standard ones, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like fluoxetine ( Prozac, Sarafem) and sertraline ( Zoloft), can cause diarrhea. Work with your doctor to find the right one. Women with IBS tend to have worse symptoms during their periods. There's not a lot you can do to prevent it, but you can ease pain and discomfort during that time of the month. How to Feel Better: Think about taking birth control pills. They can make your periods more regular. But they can cause side effects, like upset stomach, vomiting, stomach cramps or bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Work with your doctor to find one that works without causing other problems. Treat severe PMS. Some drugs that treat depression can help, such as fluoxetine ( Prozac, Sarafem), paroxetine ( Paxil), and sertraline ( Zoloft). Eating while you work or drive Eating too quickly Chewing gum Not enough exercise What to Do: Cut out distractions while you eat. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. It can help you prevent constipation and ease stress. Also, be sure to talk to your doctor about all your treatment options for IBS with constipation and IBS with diarrhea."
358,"Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS) is a procedure that allows a doctor to obtain images and information about the digestive tract and the surrounding tissue and organs, including the lungs. Ultrasound testing uses sound waves to make a picture of internal organs. During the procedure, a small ultrasound device is installed on the tip of an endoscope. An endoscope is a small, lighted, flexible tube with a camera attached. By inserting the endoscope and camera into the upper or the lower digestive tract, the doctor is able to obtain high-quality ultrasound images of organs. Because the EUS can get close to the organ(s) being examined, the images obtained with EUS are often more accurate and detailed than images provided by traditional ultrasound which must travel from the outside of the body. Endoscopic ultrasound may be used to: Evaluate stages of cancer. Evaluate chronic pancreatitis or other disorders of the pancreas. Study abnormalities or tumors in organs, including the gallbladder and liver. Study the muscles of the lower rectum and anal canal to determine reasons forfecalincontinence(accidental bowel leakage). Study nodules (bumps) in the intestinal wall. A person undergoing an endoscopic ultrasound will be sedated prior to the procedure. After sedation, the doctor inserts an endoscope into the person's mouth or rectum. The doctor will observe the inside of the intestinal tract on a TV monitor and the ultrasound image on another monitor. Additionally the sound wave testing may be used to locate and help take biopsies (small piece of tissue to examine by microscope). The entire procedure usually takes 30 to 90 minutes and the patient usually can go home the same day of the procedure."
359,"It takes a big commitment to keep your diabetes in check. You'll be more motivated on some days than others. You'll also wonder how it's going. It's natural for negative thoughts to creep in once in a while. You can counter them whenever they strike. Rethink it: Take it 10 minutes at a time. Tell yourself, â I don't have to do it all at once.â Exercise doesn't have to take a lot of time. Even a little will give you a burst of optimism and energy while it improves your metabolism. Try 10-minute spurts of activity. You won't need to change your clothes. For example, instead of playing solitaire on your phone when you're in a waiting room, ask the attendant if you have time to take a 10-minute walk around the parking lot before your appointment. This is a classic ""it's too late for me"" thought. Your goal weight feels always out of reach. Maybe you've tried to get there before and got disappointed. Rethink it: Bring your thoughts back to the here and now. Mental health experts say most anxiety comes from worrying about the future. The more you focus on what you can do today, the better. Little steps, over time, will move your health in a positive direction. Ask your doctor to help you set small goals along the way to your ultimate goal. You want reachable milestones you can build on. For instance, if you lose a little bit of weight at a time, it can lower your blood sugar levels and blood pressure sooner than you may think. Start slowly. First, learn to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. You didn't follow your meal plan when you ate a giant plate of macaroni and cheese, and now you think you've wrecked all your progress. Rethink it: Give yourself credit for your good food choices. It could be that you used to overeat all the time, and now you've had balanced meals most days this week. Aim for progress, not perfection. You don't have to give up your favorite foods completely. Just account for the calories and carbs. Set the setbacks aside. Tell yourself, â I can get back on track,â and the possibilities open back up. It takes practice to turn your inner voice into your friend instead of your critic. Make it a habit with these tips: Keep a journal. Write down your thoughts. After about a week, read your journal to look for patterns. Write positive messages for yourself, like â I am healthy."" "" I am strong."" "" I am managing my health well.â Put them in places you'll see every day -- your wallet, a bedside table, near your toothpaste. Say something positive to yourself every time you look in the mirror. â Nice smile!â â My hair looks really good today!â â This is a great color on me!â"
360,"Surgery is one of the major causes of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT), a blood clot that forms in the deep veins of your body, often in your leg. Clots happen when blood thickens and sticks together. That can be a good thing when it prevents you from bleeding, but not so much when a clot forms inside your blood vessels. Sometimes, one can travel to your lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism ( PE), and it can be life-threatening if it blocks blood flow. While a clot can form after any type of procedure, you're more likely to get one if you've had major surgery, particularly on your abdomen, pelvis, hips, or legs. DVT is common after an operation because you're usually staying in bed for long periods of time while you recover. When you stop moving, blood flows more slowly in your deep veins, which can lead to a clot. You're most likely to get a clot between 2 and 10 days after your surgery, but your odds are higher for about 3 months. You may have a greater chance of DVT after surgery when you: Smoke Had DVT in the past Are overweight or obese Have close family members with DVT Are pregnant Have a disorder that affects your blood or veins Are older Use certain medicines, including birth control and hormone therapy Have specific types of cancer Sometimes, the surgery itself can cause a blood clot. Long procedures where you're lying on the operating table for many hours allow your blood to settle and pool, which makes it easier to clot. Tissue, debris, fat, or collagen could get released into your blood system during an operation, making blood thicker around those particles. Blood clots can also form if your veins are damaged during an operation. Surgeries that involve scraping or cutting into a bone, such as a hip replacement, may release substances known as antigens. These antigens trigger your body's immune system and can lead to clots. Only about half of people who get DVT have symptoms. Let your doctor know right away if you have any signs of DVT or PE: Pain or tenderness in your leg Swelling or warmth in your leg Red or discolored skin on your leg Veins that stick out Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Sudden chest pain Painful breathing Before your surgery, stop smoking. Work on getting rid of any extra pounds you're carrying. Talk to your doctor if you need help. After your surgery, you'll want you to keep your blood moving. Your doctor may prescribe blood thinner medicines, which are also called anticoagulants. They make it harder for your blood to stick together and form clots. Simple movements, such as leg lifts while you're in bed, can improve blood flow. You might need to take pain medicine so you can exercise comfortably. Elastic compression stockings or a compression device can help stop blood from pooling in your veins."
361,"No special preparation is necessary for a X-ray, but you should tell the technician if you could be pregnant. The risks of radiation exposure to the fetus are small, but they should be minimized, You will need to remove all jewelry before the test. You may need to remove some clothing, depending on the part of the body being X-rayed. You'll be given something to cover yourself. The X-ray is performed in a radiology department. The X-ray machine will send a beam of ionizing radiation through an X-ray tube. This energy passes through the part of the body being X-rayed and is then absorbed on film or a digital camera to create a picture. Bones and other dense areas show up as lighter shades of gray to white, while areas that don't absorb the radiation appear as dark gray to black. The entire test takes no more than 10 to 15 minutes. You will feel no discomfort from the X-ray test."
362," The bladder is a hollow organ in the pelvis that stores urine. The pressure created when the bladder fills with urine is what causes the urge to urinate. During urination, the urine travels from the bladder and out the body through the urethra. In women, the front wall of the vagina supports the bladder. This wall can weaken or loosen with age. Significant bodily stress such as childbirth can also damage this part of the vaginal wall. If it deteriorates enough, the bladder can prolapse, meaning it is no longer supported and descends into the vagina. This may trigger problems such as urinary difficulties, discomfort, and stress incontinence (urine leakage caused by sneezing, coughing, and exertion, for example). Prolapsed bladders (also called cystoceles or fallen bladders) are separated into four grades based on how far the bladder droops into the vagina. Grade 1 (mild): Only a small portion of the bladder droops into the vagina. Grade 2 (moderate): The bladder droops enough to be able to reach the opening of the vagina. Grade 3 (severe): The bladder protrudes from the body through the vaginal opening. Grade 4 (complete): The entire bladder protrudes completely outside the vagina; usually associated with other forms of pelvic organ prolapse (uterine prolapse, rectocele, enterocele). Prolapsed bladders are commonly associated with menopause. Prior to menopause, women's bodies create the hormone estrogen, which helps keep the muscles in and around the vagina strong. Women's bodies stop creating as much estrogen after menopause, and those muscles tend to weaken as a result. The following factors are commonly associated with causing a prolapsed bladder: Childbirth: This is the most common cause of a prolapsed bladder. The delivery process is stressful on the vaginal tissues and muscles, which support a woman's bladder. Menopause: Estrogen, a hormone that helps maintain the strength and health of muscles in the vagina, is not produced after menopause. Straining: Lifting heavy objects, straining during bowel movements, having a long-term condition that involves coughing, or having long-term constipation may damage the muscles of the pelvic floor. The first symptom that women with a prolapsed bladder usually notice is the presence of tissue in the vagina that many women describe as something that feels like a ball. Other symptoms of a prolapsed bladder include the following: Discomfort or pain in the pelvis Tissue protruding from the vagina ( The tissue may be tender and may bleed.) Difficulty urinating A feeling that the bladder is not empty immediately after urinating (incomplete voiding) Stress incontinence (urine leakage during sneezing, coughing, or exertion) More frequent bladder infections Painful intercourse (dyspareunia) Low back pain Some women may not experience or notice symptoms of a mild (grade 1) prolapsed bladder. Any woman who notices symptoms of a prolapsed bladder should see her doctor. A prolapsed bladder is commonly associated with prolapses of other organs within a woman's pelvis. Thus, timely medical care is recommended to evaluate for and to prevent problematic symptoms and complications caused by weakening tissue and muscle in the vagina. Prolapsed organs cannot heal themselves, and most worsen over time. Several treatments are available to correct a prolapsed bladder. An exam of the female genitalia and pelvis, known as a pelvic exam, is required in order to diagnose a prolapsed bladder. A bladder that has entered the vagina confirms the diagnosis. For less obvious cases, the doctor may use a voiding cystourethrogram to help with the diagnosis. A voiding cystourethrogram is a series of X-rays that are taken during urination. These help the doctor determine the shape of the bladder and the cause of urinary difficulty. The doctor may also test or take X-rays of different parts of the abdomen to rule out other possible causes of discomfort or urinary difficulty. After diagnosis, the doctor may test the nerves, muscles, and the intensity of the urine stream to help decide what type of treatment is appropriate. A test called urodynamics or video urodynamics may be performed at the doctor's discretion. These tests are sometimes referred to as "" EKGs of the bladder"". Urodynamics measures pressure and volume relationships in the bladder and may be crucial in the decision making of the urologist. Cystoscopy (looking into the bladder with a scope) may also be performed to identify treatment options. This test is an outpatient office procedure that is sometimes performed on a television screen so the person can see what the urologist sees. Cystoscopy has little risk and is tolerable for the vast majority of people. A mild (grade 1) prolapsed bladder that produces no pain or discomfort usually requires no medical or surgical treatment. The doctor may recommend that a woman with a grade 1 prolapsed bladder should avoid heavy lifting or straining, although there is little evidence to support this recommendation. For cases that are more serious, the doctor takes into account various factors, such as the woman's age, general health, treatment preference, and the severity of the prolapsed bladder to determine which treatment is appropriate. Nonsurgical treatments for a prolapsed bladder include the following: Pessary: A pessary is a device that is placed within the vagina to hold the bladder in place. Pessaries must be removed and cleaned at regular intervals to prevent infection. Some pessaries are designed to allow the woman to do this herself. A doctor must remove and clean other types. Estrogen cream is commonly used along with a pessary to help prevent infection and vaginal wall erosion. Some women find that pessaries are uncomfortable or that they easily fall out. Estrogen replacement therapy: Many women with prolapsed bladders may benefit from this therapy. Estrogen helps strengthen and maintain muscles in the vagina. For mild-to-moderate cases of prolapsed bladder, the doctor may recommend activity modification such as avoiding heavy lifting or straining. The doctor may also recommend Kegel exercises. These are exercises used to tighten the muscles of the pelvic floor. Kegel exercises might be used to treat mild-to-moderate prolapses or to supplement other treatments for prolapses that are more serious. Estrogen replacement therapy may be used for a prolapsed bladder to help the body strengthen the tissues in and around the vagina. Estrogen replacement therapy can't be used by everyone (such as in a people with certain types of cancer). Women's bodies stop creating as much estrogen naturally after menopause, and the muscles of the vagina may weaken as a result. In mild cases of prolapsed bladder, estrogen may be prescribed in an attempt to reverse bladder prolapse symptoms, such as vaginal weakening and incontinence. For more severe degrees of prolapse, estrogen replacement therapy may be used along with other types of treatment. Estrogen can be administered orally as a pill or topically as a patch or cream. The cream has very little systemic absorption and has a potent effect locally where it is applied. Topical administration has less risk than the oral preparations. The application of estrogens to the anterior vagina and urethral area may be very helpful in alleviating urinary symptoms, such as urgency and frequency, even in the face of prolapsed bladder. Severe prolapsed bladders that cannot be managed with a pessary usually require surgery to correct them. Prolapsed bladder surgery is usually performed through the vagina, and the goal is to secure the bladder in its correct position. The bladder is repaired with an incision in the vaginal wall. The prolapsed area is closed and the wall is strengthened. Depending on the procedure, surgery can be performed while the woman is under general, regional, or local anesthesia. For smaller surgeries, many women go home the same day of surgery. Various materials have been used to strengthen pelvic weakness associated with prolapsed bladder. The risks of placing mesh through the vagina to repair pelvic organ prolapse may outweigh its benefits, according to the FDA. However, the use of mesh may be appropriate in some situations. A surgeon should explain in detail the risks, benefits, and potential complications of these materials and he or she should explain about the procedure itself before proceeding with the surgery. After surgery, most women can expect to return to a normal level of activity after six weeks. However, surgeons may recommend reducing or eliminating activities that cause straining for up to six months. Physical therapy such as electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be used for a prolapsed bladder to help strengthen the muscles in the pelvis. Electrical stimulation: A doctor can apply a probe to targeted muscles within the vagina or on the pelvic floor. The probe is attached to a device that measures and delivers small electrical currents that contract the muscles. These contractions help strengthen the muscles. A less intrusive type of electrical stimulation is available that magnetically stimulates the pudendal nerve from outside the body. This activates the muscles of the pelvic floor and may help treat incontinence. Biofeedback: A sensor is used to monitor muscle activity in the vagina and on the pelvic floor. The doctor can recommend exercises that can strengthen these muscles. These exercises may help strengthen the muscles to reverse or relieve some symptoms related to a prolapsed bladder. The sensor can monitor the muscular contractions during the exercises, and the doctor may be able to determine if the targeted muscles would benefit from the exercises. A woman undergoing treatment should schedule follow-up visits with her doctor to evaluate progress. Pessaries need to be removed and cleaned at regular intervals to prevent complications. To prevent a prolapsed bladder, a high-fiber diet and a daily intake of plenty of fluids can reduce a person's risk of developing constipation. Straining during bowel movements should be avoided, if possible. Women with long-term constipation should seek medical attention in order to lessen the chance of developing a prolapsed bladder. Heavy lifting is associated with prolapsed bladder and should be avoided, if possible. Obesity is a risk factor for developing a prolapsed bladder. Weight control may help prevent this condition from developing. A prolapsed bladder is rarely a life-threatening condition. Most cases that are mild can be treated without surgery, and most severe prolapsed bladders can be completely corrected with surgery.

363,"If your new baby's skin and eyes look yellow, it's possible he may have jaundice. It may seem alarming to you, but it's a common problem in newborns, and it's usually harmless. Sometimes it goes away on its own, or your doctor may suggest light therapy or other treatments to knock it out. Jaundice happens when too much bilirubin -- a chemical that red blood cells release during their normal breakdown process -- builds up in the blood. About 60% of babies get it. Some of the body's red blood cells break down every day and create bilirubin in the blood. It's the liver's job to filter it out of the bloodstream. When your baby is still in your womb, your liver clears out his bilirubin for him. After birth, your baby's liver takes over. Sometimes, your newborn's liver can't break down bilirubin as quickly as his body makes it, and it starts to build up. Because bilirubin is a yellow compound, it turns your baby's skin and eyes yellow. Too much bilirubin in the blood is the most common cause of jaundice. At very high levels, bilirubin can cause brain damage, but this is rare. Your newborn might be getting jaundice because he: Has a liver that's still maturing Was born prematurely Isn't getting enough breast milk, or something in the breast milk is causing jaundice Jaundice typically shows up 2 or 3 days after your baby is born. Some types may show up sooner or much later. These kinds are caused by a disease or condition, such as: Hemorrhage (bleeding) somewhere inside your baby's body Infection of the blood (sepsis) Bacterial or viral infections Liver problems Lack of certain enzymes Problem with red blood cells that makes them break too easily Jaundice may also happen if a mom has a different blood type from her baby. If that's your situation, your body may make antibodies that attack your baby's red blood cells. In some cases, you can help prevent this by getting special shots when you're pregnant. Your baby may have a greater chance of getting jaundice if he's: Born before 37 weeks Of East Asian or Mediterranean descent Has trouble breast or bottle feeding A younger sibling of a child who had jaundice Born to a mother with O-type or Rh negative blood The telltale sign of jaundice is a yellow color to your baby's skin and yellow in the whites of his eyes. It typically starts on the face. Once bilirubin levels in the blood get higher, the yellow color moves to the chest and stomach, and then, finally, the legs and arms. Usually, a doctor can tell your baby has jaundice by looking at him. But she will also want to know how much bilirubin is in your baby's blood to help decide on a treatment plan. She may: Draw blood from your baby and send it to a lab. Test your baby's skin with an instrument that measures bilirubin levels by shining a special light on him. If your doctor suspects that a condition is causing your baby's jaundice, she may do other tests, like a urine sample. In many cases, jaundice goes away on its own in 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will decide whether your baby should wait it out or start treatments like: Extra feedings. Taking in more breast milk or formula will help your baby poop more often, which can help clear out bilirubin from the body. Or, if your baby is having trouble breastfeeding, your doctor may recommend you feed him breast milk from a bottle or also feed him formula. Phototherapy. In this treatment, the doctor puts your baby under blue-green lights. It can help bilirubin leave his body in his urine. He'll wear a diaper only so that most of his skin can soak up the light. He'll wear patches to protect his eyes. The light may come from a special pad or mattress that puts out blue-green light. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg). If your baby's jaundice happens because he has a different type from his mom, your doctor may need to give him a blood protein through an IV that helps stop the breakdown of red blood cells. Exchange transfusion. If your baby has severe jaundice that isn't getting better with other methods, he may need a blood transfusion called an exchange transfusion. In this process, your doctor draws small amounts of your baby's blood and replaces it with blood from a donor. Your baby will need to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) for the procedure. It's rare for babies to need this level of treatment for jaundice. There isn't much you can do to prevent the typical jaundice in newborns. But you can help move it along by being sure your baby is well fed. If you're breastfeeding, aim for 8-12 feedings a day in the first days of your baby's life. If you're formula feeding, offer 1-2 ounces every 2-3 hours."
364,"Your skin is thinner and more sensitive in some places, like your face, genitals, and the skin folds under your breasts and buttocks and in your groin. Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of ""moisture-wicking"" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you. Extra pounds can create more skin folds where psoriasis could show up. When you're heavy, you're also more likely to sweat, which can make your symptoms worse. Losing a few pounds may make a big difference to your comfort and the health of your skin."
365,"Your eyelashes do more than draw attention to your beautiful peepers. They help keep gunk out of your eyes. But sometimes, they grow in the wrong direction. This is a common condition called trichiasis. That's when your eyelashes turn inward. They can rub against your eyeball and cause problems. Luckily, your doctor can help. You can get trichiasis after an eye infection, or because you've hurt your eye or eyelid. Just getting older can also cause it, because your skin becomes less elastic as you age. It's more common in adults, but children can get it, too. Some are born with it. Others get it from rubbing their eyes too much. You may feel like you have something in your eye. It might be red, sensitive to light, hurt, or tear up easily. You may have blurred vision. Or, you might have no symptoms. Eyelashes that brush up against your cornea -- the clear, front part of your eye -- for a long time could cause eye irritation or a more serious condition on the surface of your eye. That can lead to infection and scarring. It could even affect your eyesight. There are many ways to treat trichiasis. Your doctor may use little forceps to pluck out the pesky lashes. This is the most common way to treat it. He'll numb your eyeball with drops and pull the lash out of its follicle. It usually comes out easily and doesn't hurt. You may need artificial teardrops for a couple of days. Your lashes will grow back in 3 to 5 months, but there's still a chance they'll come in the wrong way. Children often outgrow trichiasis. If your child has a scratch on her eye, her doctor may prescribe antibiotic drops. He may also suggest an artificial tear ointment to protect it. To clear up wrong-way eyelashes for good, your doctor may suggest surgery. Options include: Ablation. This normally takes place in an office or clinic. Your doctor numbs your eye. He then uses lasers to remove lashes and hair follicles. Electrolysis. Your doctor removes the lashes with electricity. Cryosurgery. The doctor removes the lashes and follicles by freezing them. Talk to your eye doctor about the best treatment for you."
366,"Aspirin is another name for acetylsalicylic acid, a common pain reliever (also called an analgesic). The earliest known uses of the drug can be traced back to the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC. He used powder extracted from the bark of willows to treat pain and reduce fever. For a variety of reasons, some people intentionally ingest poisons or poison others. Some reasons include: Suicide Gaining personal attention Child abuse Aspirin poisoning can also be accidental and was once the most common cause of accidental poisoning of children. Safety precautions such as child-resistant packaging has helped make it less common. Inappropriate dosing in both children and elderly people is one of the reasons accidental aspirin poisonings continue to happen. Hundreds of medications -- both over-the-counter and prescription medicines -- contain aspirin or aspirin-like substances. Unintentional poisoning can result if these medications are taken in combination, in inappropriate doses, or over a long time period. This is especially likely to occur in older people with chronic health problems. The earliest symptoms of acute aspirin poisoning may include ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and impaired hearing. More clinically significant signs and symptoms may include rapid breathing (hyperventilation), vomiting, dehydration, fever, double vision, and feeling faint. Later signs of aspirin poisoning, or signs of more significant poisoning, can include drowsiness or confusion, bizarre behavior, unsteady walking, and coma. The abnormal breathing caused by aspirin poisoning is usually rapid and deep. Vomiting may occur 3-8 hours after taking too much aspirin. Serious dehydration may occur from hyperventilation, vomiting, and fever. If you have been taking aspirin and begin to have ringing in your ears, call your doctor to see if the medication should be stopped or the dosage reduced.. For all other symptoms, call 911 (or the local emergency phone number) immediately. Serious symptoms include the following: Agitation, fever, convulsions, collapse, confusion, coma Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Wheezing Nausea and vomiting Bleeding Hallucinations Drowsiness The doctor will take a history and perform a physical examination to look for evidence of poisoning. The doctor will order laboratory tests to look for damage to organ systems that can be harmed by aspirin overdose and, depending on the timing, also to check for the level of aspirin in the bloodstream. The doctor will make sure you are able to breathe and will check vital signs including body temperature. The doctor will check alertness by asking you to respond to questions. If you are unconscious, the doctor will give oxygen and perhaps use machines to help you breathe. Blood will be taken for lab testing. One blood test will measure the amount of salicylate, the active ingredient in aspirin, in your blood. Sometimes the blood level of salicylate can increase over time even though an individual has not taken any more aspirin. This may indicate the person has taken coated tablets or sustained-release tablets, which release salicylate into the bloodstream slowly. The doctor will make treatment decisions based on the dose of active ingredient ingested, the time over which it was ingested, your age, the symptoms you are experiencing, and your acid-base status. Acid-base status is the balance of acid and base in the blood. Aspirin may change this balance quickly, so the doctor will monitor this to guide treatment. Call 911 immediately if a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the victim is unconscious, having convulsions, not breathing, or is otherwise seriously ill. If the person who took the aspirin is not having symptoms, do not wait to see if symptoms develop. Call the local poison control center immediately. It is a good idea to post the telephone number of the local poison control center near the phone. This information can be found at: American Association of Poison Control Centers. Or call (800) 222-1222 if you have a poisoning emergency. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emergency department staff will want the following information: Is the person conscious? Is the person breathing? What medications were taken? Try to locate the medicine container. What is the medicine's name and how many milligrams (mg) is each pill? How much of the medicine did the person take and when was it taken? Was the medicine taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals? How old is the person who took the medicine? What are the current symptoms? What medical conditions does the person have? Although ipecac syrup was used in the past to make the victim vomit, it is rarely recommended today and is not usually appropriate in aspirin poisoning. Causing vomiting can be very dangerous in the case of an altered mental status or convulsions. Doctors may use gastric lavage, or pumping out the stomach contents, to try to prevent further absorption of the aspirin into the body. Dialysis is also sometimes used to reduce the amount of salicylate in the body. Activated charcoal: To prevent more absorption, the doctor may give activated charcoal to absorb the salicylate from the stomach. A laxative may be given with the activated charcoal to move the mixture through the gastrointestinal system more rapidly. People who have been severely poisoned may be given repeated doses of activated charcoal. IV fluids: Dehydration occurs early in aspirin poisoning. To correct dehydration, the doctor will start an IV to provide fluids. The doctor will also work to correct imbalances in the body's blood chemistries. Alkaline diuresis: This is a way to reduce the amount of salicylate in the body. Alkaline diuresis is the process of giving a person who has been poisoned compounds that alter the chemistry of the blood and urine in a way that allows the kidneys to remove more salicylate. Specifically, sodium bicarbonate is given via IV to make the blood and urine less acidic (more alkaline). This encourages the kidneys to capture more salicylate that can leave the body through the urine. Sometimes, other compounds, such as potassium, also have to be given to help with this process. The emergency physician may have to perform other procedures or give other medications as supportive care in the case of a dangerous aspirin overdose. These actions may include the following: Placing a breathing tube (intubation) and assisting breathing with a ventilator for a person who is in a coma, cannot protect his or her own airway, or needs mechanical breathing Placing of a catheter into the bladder to monitor urine output and frequently check the acidity (p H) of the urine Giving other medicines as needed to treat agitation, convulsions (seizures), or other complications of aspirin poisoning A person with serious symptoms may be admitted to an intensive care unit. If the overdose was intentional, psychiatric services should be provided. A person with minor symptoms such as ringing in the ears or nausea may be admitted to the hospital for further observation. The following people, will likely be admitted to the hospital regardless of salicylate levels: Infants and elderly persons People with long-term salicylism People who ingested sustained-release products Psychiatric and medical follow-up may be recommended. Careful monitoring of medication will also be recommended. Tests to monitor kidney function may be done periodically after hospital discharge, especially in elderly people. Prescription medications should be used according to your doctor's and pharmacist's directions. Never take a medicine prescribed for someone else. To protect children from accidental drug overdose, all medications should be stored in containers with child-resistant caps. All medications should be out of sight and out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Take suicidal threats seriously. Never give or take medication in the dark. Always tell the doctor of any previous side effects or adverse reactions to medication as well as any new or unusual symptoms that occur. Never take more than the recommended or prescribed dose of a medication. Inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking. Be sure to mention over-the-counter medications. Recovery is likely if the proper treatment is given and the dose of aspirin taken is not too high. With chronic aspirin poisoning outcomes are less predictable. With acute aspirin poisoning, severity and outcome depend on many factors including the dose taken and the person's body weight.

367,"Neuropathy means that your nerves don't work the way they should because your nerve cells, or neurons, are damaged or destroyed. It can cause changes in your: Sensory nerves, which you need to feel things. You may have pain, tingling, or numbness. Motor nerves, which control movement. Damage in these nerves can cause weakness. Autonomic nerves, which manage physical functions you don't control, such as your heart rate and blood pressure. It's a common condition, especially among people with diabetes. But many other things can cause neuropathy, too. Injury Car accidents, sports injuries, broken bones, or even surgery can cause nerve damage. That can lead to neuropathy. What helps: Talk with your doctor about ways to control any pain and whether physical therapy, acupuncture, or aids such as a brace, cane, or orthopedic shoes would be useful. Repetitive Physical Stress This includes activities such as typing, playing tennis, or any activity that repeatedly uses a certain part of the body (like your wrist or elbow). This can cause your ligaments, tendons, and muscles to become inflamed and swollen. That puts pressure on your nerves, which can lead to neuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common repetitive stress conditions that cause neuropathy. It happens when a certain nerve in your wrist and hand becomes inflamed from repeated or awkward movements. This can make your hands tingle and feel numb. What helps: Physical therapy or occupational therapy is a good place to learn different ways to heal injuries and learn new ways to do everyday tasks to help prevent new injuries. Vitamin Imbalances or Deficiencies If you don't get enough of certain vitamins, your nerves can become damaged and stop working properly. Vitamin B12 is especially important for your nerves to work properly. Vitamins E, B1, B6, B9, folate, and niacin also play a role. A restricted or poor diet or health problems such as Crohn's disease are some reasons you may not get enough vitamins. What helps: If you're on a diet, or if you have a condition that makes it hard for you to get the nutrients you need, ask your doctor for advice. She may refer you to a dietitian. Too Much Alcohol Heavy drinking can rob your body of essential nutrients, especially B vitamins like folate and B12. It can damage nerve tissue, too. That can cause neuropathy, especially in your arms and legs. What helps: If you or others think that you might be drinking too much, talk with your doctor. It's a confidential way to find out about resources that can help. Some Medications Chemotherapy, HIV drugs, and some other drugs can cause tingling, numbness, or even movement problems. What helps: Most of the time, neuropathy goes away after you stop using the medication, though it usually takes several months. Check with your doctor before you stop taking any prescription medicine. Poison or Toxins If you're exposed to heavy metals like lead, arsenic, or mercury, or certain insecticides or industrial-strength chemicals, you could develop neuropathy. What helps: If you know you've been exposed, call your doctor or poison control center. Infections and Immune System Disorders Some germs can damage your nerve fibers. These include HIV, the herpes virus, and the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. In an autoimmune disorder, your immune system mistakenly attacks your body. Some, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, can also affect nerve tissue and may cause neuropathy. What helps: If you know you have an immune system disorder, follow the treatment plan your doctor gave you, and let her know how you're doing or if you have any side effects. Diabetes It doesn't happen overnight, but diabetes can cause nerve damage, especially if your blood sugar is out of control. You may have pain, tingling, or no feeling in your feet, legs, and hands. Or you might not have any symptoms. What helps: It's important to get your blood sugar under control. If you have pain, tell your doctor. And be sure to clean your feet daily and check them for any problems, in case you don't have feeling in them. Other Conditions These include vascular disorders (which affect your body's blood vessels), kidney problems, cancer, benign tumors, and other diseases. It's less common, but some hereditary or genetic conditions can cause neuropathy. What helps: Treating the underlying condition may help stop nerve damage from becoming worse. No Known Cause Sometimes doctors can't figure out what causes neuropathy. They call it âidiopathic neuropathyâ or say it's of âidiopathic origin.â ( Idiopathic means that they don't know what the cause is.) This accounts for 30% to 40% of all neuropathy cases. It's most likely to happen to you if you're over age 60, but it's not a normal part of aging. With idiopathic neuropathy, neuropathy symptoms usually come on slowly. What helps: Focus on treating the symptoms. Your doctor can make recommendations for that. If you have tingling, numbness, loss of coordination, muscle weakness, or other things that don't seem normal, see your doctor right away. He or she will give you a checkup and talk to you about your health history. In many cases, treating the condition or problem that causes your neuropathy can curb nerve damage and ease your symptoms. If these symptoms happen suddenly, call 911 for immediate medical help."
368,"It's an inflammation of your liver that's caused by a virus. There are five types of this condition, but the most common ones in the U. S. are hepatitis A, B, and C. The effects of hepatitis A, B, and C are similar. You might have: Loss of appetite Nausea Discomfort in your belly Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Yellowing of the skin and eyes (called jaundice) If you have long-term hepatitis C, it could lead to scarring of your liver, called cirrhosis. You get it by eating or drinking something that's got the virus in it. You get it when blood from someone who's infected gets into your body. For instance, you can catch it if you share needles when using illegal drugs. You can also get hepatitis B if you have sex without using a condom with someone who's got it. If you're pregnant and you've got hepatitis B, you could pass it to your child during birth. Like hepatitis B, you get this type when the blood of someone who's infected enters your body. This can happen through sharing needles when using illegal drugs. An infected mother can also give the disease to her newborn child during birth. The hepatitis A virus can live outside the body for months. Hepatitis B survives for at least 7 days while still being able to cause an infection. Hepatitis C can live outside the body for up to 4 days and still spread the disease. Studies show that a vaccine will prevent the disease for at least 20 years. But booster doses aren't routinely recommended. If you have long-term hepatitis B you might be a ""carrier,"" which means you can infect others. No. If for some reason you stop your vaccines in the middle of the series, you can resume with the next dose. Medicines for this disease include: Adefovir, dipivoxil ( Hepsera) Entecavir ( Baraclude) Lamivudine ( Epivir- HBV) Interferon alfa-2b ( Intron A) Pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys) Telbivudine ( Tyzeka) Tenofovir ( Viread) Before the drugs we now have available, the typical treatment was a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. But new medicines have come out in recent years that do not require interferon, are generally well tolerated, and cure more people. Your treatment will depend on many things including what type of hepatitis C virus you have. In the U. S., the most common is genotype 1, followed by genotypes 2 and 3. Genotypes 4, 5, and 6 are rare in the U. S. Your doctor may suggest you take: Daclatasvir ( Daklinza) Elbasvir /grazoprevir ( Zepatier) Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir ( Harvoni) Ombitasvir-paritaprevir-dasabuvir-ritonavir ( Viekira Pak) Ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir ( Technivie) Sofosbuvir ( Sovaldi) Sofosbuvir /velpatasvir ( Epclusa)"
369,"If you've had a mastectomy because of breast cancer, you may choose to have reconstructive plastic surgery. It can restore symmetry between the two breasts by replacing skin, breast tissue, and the removed nipple. The amount of reconstruction will depend on the mastectomy, and the width, size, and location of the removed tumor. The long-term prospects of living without a breast or part of one affects every woman differently. The choice for one woman won't necessarily be right for another. It's a personal decision, and it's often not easy to make. You can choose to skip reconstruction. You can wear external breast forms or pads, or make no attempt to change your appearance. Improvements in plastic surgery mean better results now than ever before, though. You can choose breast reconstruction using either breast implants or your own tissue. The operation changes your appearance, but it can have psychological benefits as well. It can add to a sense of wellness for you and your family. Restoring the breast isn't considered a cosmetic procedure. It's reconstructive surgery. Since it's considered part of the treatment of a disease, the law says insurance providers must provide coverage. The timing is based on your desires, medical conditions, and cancer treatment. You can choose to have it done during the same operation to remove the breast, or months or years after a mastectomy. If you've started any chemotherapy or radiation treatments, reconstruction is usually postponed until you complete those treatments. Your surgeon can help you decide the right timing for you. You and your doctor will need to talk about your wants and needs, your medical condition, and any previous surgery before you decide. Implants involve stretching the skin with a tissue expander that goes inside you, and then inserting a silicone-gel or saline (salt water) implant weeks later. The tissue expander is filled to a desired volume by adding saline, usually once a week for a few sessions. Many women find these sessions painful, but they're often pleased with the final result. Implants can rupture, causing pain and infection. You may need surgery to remove or replace them. Tissue flap procedures use a woman's own tissue taken from the abdomen or back (or sometimes the thighs and bottom) to create a mound to reconstruct the breast. Taking abdominal tissue is called a TRAM flap. Taking tissue from the back is called a latissimus dorsi flap. Sometimes the tissue being moved is kept attached to its blood supply. Other times it's disconnected and then reconnected to a blood supply near the new location. You may want to consider nipple reconstruction, too. Usually, the nipple and areola (the dark area around the nipple) are removed during the mastectomy to lower the chance of cancer returning. Nipple reconstruction is typically an outpatient procedure done with local anesthesia. You may have it after breast reconstruction is complete. This allows the new tissue to heal and settle into place. Minor adjustments in size and position of the breast can be carried out when the nipple and areola are rebuilt. Surgeons can make a nipple from tissue taken from the back or abdominal flap. It's then tattooed to resemble the color of a nipple. In rare cases, the nipple from the original breast can be reattached, but only if the surgeon is convinced the tissue is cancer-free. Because of a lack of nerve connections, the nipple will not rise or flatten in response to touch or temperature. A prosthetic nipple is another option. The plastic surgeon makes a copy of your natural nipple and colors the areola. It can be glued to the breast and re-glued every week or so. Preparation for the procedure, including getting anesthesia, may take 2 hours. Once it begins, the reconstruction will take anywhere from 1 to 6 hours. After the surgery, you'll spend about 2 to 3 hours in recovery before being transferred to a hospital room. You may have some discomfort for the first few days afterward. You'll be given pain medication as needed. Throughout your hospital stay, the staff will closely watch you. Soon after surgery you'll be encouraged to move your arms, but not for any forceful activity like pulling yourself up, getting out of bed, or lifting heavy objects. Nurses will help you in and out of bed. The day after surgery, you may be able to sit in a chair beside the bed. On the second day, most patients are walking without help. You'll likely get IV fluids for a day or two. You may have a urinary catheter in overnight or until you can walk to the bathroom. You'll also have drains at the incision sites. If you go home with these drains in place, you'll get instructions on how to care for them. The length of your hospital stay depends on the type of operation and how your recovery goes. If you got implants, the average hospital stay is 1 to 2 days. Flap procedures may require a stay of 5 to 6 days. After you go home, you can expect some soreness, swelling, and bruising for 2 to 3 weeks. You may be asked to apply medications to the suture area or change bandages at home. Your plastic surgeon will advise you about showering, bathing, and wound care. Most women return to normal activities within 6 to 8 weeks after surgery. It may be several weeks before you can do strenuous exercise. The mastectomy and breast reconstruction will leave areas of numbness where the surgery was performed. Instead of feeling pain where the tissue was taken, you may feel numbness and tightness. In time, some feeling may return in your breasts. Most scars will fade over time. The shape of your reconstructed breast will gradually improve over the months. You'll be asked to return for regular checkups at first. If you have a temporary expander implanted, it will be expanded with saline once a week, on average, until the desired size is reached (usually within six to 10 office visits). Keep doing self-exams of your breasts every month, and have an annual mammogram. Breast reconstruction doesn't change the chance of cancer coming back, and it generally doesn't interfere with treatment. If the disease does come back, your medical team can still treat you with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy."
370,"â Walking pneumonia"" sounds like it could be the name of a sci-fi horror flick. But it's actually the least scary kind of pneumonia. It can be milder than the other types, and you usually don't have to stay in the hospital. You could have walking pneumonia and not even know it.  Walking pneumonia is how some people describe a mild case of pneumonia. Your doctor might call it âatypical pneumoniaâ because it's not like more serious cases. A lung infection is often to blame. Lots of things can cause it, including: Bacteria Viruses Fungi Chemicals Inhaled food Walking pneumonia usually is due to a bacterium called Mycoplasma pneumoniae. If you have this condition, you probably won't have to stay in bed or in the hospital. You might even feel good enough go to work and keep up your regular routine, just as you might with a cold. Anyone can get it. Walking pneumonia from mycoplasma is most common in children, military recruits, and adults younger than 40. People who live and work in crowded places -- such as schools, dorms, military barracks, and nursing homes -- are more likely to be exposed to it. Late summer and fall are the most common times of year for you to get walking pneumonia. But infections can happen throughout the year. Yes. It spreads through sneezes or coughs. But it spreads slowly. If you get it, you could be contagious (which means you could spread it to other people) for up to 10 days. Researchers think it takes a lot of close contact with an infected person for you to develop walking pneumonia. Still, there are widespread outbreaks every four to eight years. Symptoms generally start 15 to 25 days after you're exposed to mycoplasma and slowly worsen over two to four days. You might have: Chest pain when you take a deep breath in Cough that may come in violent spasms Mild flu-like symptoms such as fever and chills Sore throat Headache Tiredness Lingering weakness that may last after other symptoms go away Some people with walking pneumonia may also have an ear infection, anemia, or a skin rash. Your doctor will make the diagnosis after talking with you and giving you a physical exam. Tell her about your symptoms and how long you've had them. She may also ask you about where you work and whether anyone at home or at work is also sick. You doctor will listen to your chest with a stethoscope. She may also ask you to get a chest X-ray and a blood test. There is a blood test that can identify a mycoplasma infection. You probably won't get that test though, unless there is a widespread outbreak in your area. Another blood test can find an increase in certain immune substances called cold agglutinins. This test won't confirm that you have walking pneumonia, but it can suggest it. Many over-the-counter medicines used for colds and flus may not relieve all of your symptoms. When you see your doctor, she will decide if you need antibiotics. If she does start you on them, you should begin to feel better within a few days. Tell your doctor about any medicines you take or plan to take. You should also drink plenty of fluids and give yourself lots of time to rest. It's possible. You might have some immunity for a while, but it's unclear how long it lasts. If you do get it again, it may be milder than the first time. There is no vaccine for mycoplasma infections, so you can't completely prevent it. There are things you can do, though, to reduce your chances of getting it: Exercise, eat a well-balanced diet, and get enough sleep. Doing these things will help keep your body healthy and better able to resist infection. Wash your hands often. It's one of the best ways to prevent germs from spreading. Don't smoke. Smoking damages the lungs, and damaged lungs are more likely to get infected. Cover your mouth with your sleeve when you cough or sneeze. And ask others to do the same. Coughing and sneezing are the main ways that these infections are spread."
371,"Skin is a seamless organ, like a fine cloth protecting valuable assets. Imagine a piece of silk. Just one small tear can make a big difference in how it looks. And it's the same with skin. Any burn, injury, or other trauma, such as surgery, can cause a scar. Now a scar isn't bad if it's small or in a location that's easy to conceal. But when it's not, you may wonder if there's a way to treat it, other than hiding it under your clothes, that will make it go away or at least change how it looks. The truth is the scar will never completely go away. But there are some methods that can help reduce its size and change its appearance. Scarring is a natural part of the healing process after an injury. Its appearance and its treatment depend on multiple factors. The depth and size of the wound or cut and the location of the injury matter. So do your age, genes, sex, and ethnicity. These are several different types of scars including: Keloid scars. These scars are the result of an overly aggressive healing process. They extend beyond the original injury. Over time, a keloid scar may hamper movement. Treatments include surgery to remove the scar, steroid injections, or silicone sheets to flatten the scar. Smaller keloids can be treated using cryotherapy (freezing therapy using liquid nitrogen). You can also prevent keloid formation by using pressure treatment or gel pads with silicone when you are injured. Keloid scars are most common among people with dark skin. Contracture scars. If your skin has been burned, you may have a contracture scar. These scars tighten skin, which can impair your ability to move. Contracture scars may also go deeper, affecting muscles and nerves. Hypertrophic scars. These are raised, red scars that are similar to keloids but do not go beyond the boundary of the injury. Treatments include injections of steroids to reduce inflammation or silicone sheets, which flatten the scar. Acne scars. If you've had severe acne, you probably have the scars to prove it. There are many types of acne scars, ranging from deep pits to scars that are angular or wavelike in appearance. Treatment options depend on the types of acne scars you have. Scar treatments may include: Over-the-counter or prescription creams, ointments, or gels. These products can be used to treat scars that are caused by cuts or other injuries or wounds. If you are under the care of a plastic surgeon and your scarring is from cosmetic or plastic surgery, ask your surgeon if over-the-counter treatment is an option. If not, there are prescriptions that may help. Often, treatments can include steroids or certain oral antihistamines for scars that cause itching and are very sensitive. Likewise, if you have scarring from severe acne, ask your dermatologist for advice. Your doctor can also recommend or use pressure treatment or silicone gel sheeting to help treat scars or as preventive care. Surgical removal or treatment. There are many options to treat deeper scars depending on your particular case. These include skin grafts, excision, dermabrasion, or laser surgery. In a skin graft, the surgeon uses skin from another area of your body. This is often used with people who've had burns. If you've got scarring that impairs function, surgery can help address the functional problems. If you've recently had surgery that has caused scars, it is best to wait at least one year before making a decision about scar treatment. Many scars fade and become less noticeable over time. Injections. You may get steroid injections to treat scars that stick out, such as keloids or hypertrophic scars. Your doctor may use this on its own or with other treatments. Other types of injections, such as collagen or other ""fillers,"" may be useful for some types of pitted scarring, although these are not usually permanent solutions. If your scar physically impairs you in any way, you may be able to get coverage from your health insurer. Ask your doctor to write a letter detailing your particular case. Your doctor can also take photos to support your case. If you are undergoing scar treatment for cosmetic purposes, you will most likely have to pay for it all yourself. If you have scars from cosmetic surgery, make sure you know what your insurer will cover. Health insurers usually don't pay for any cosmetic surgery that isn't medically necessary."
372," HDL cholesterol is the kind of cholesterol you want more of. It's called the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps protect you from getting heart disease. HDL cholesterol brings cholesterol to your liver, which sends it out of your body. So you want as much HDL as possible. You can get a blood test to check your cholesterol level. If you're a man and your HDL level is below 40, or a woman with an HDL level lower than 50, you're more likely to get heart disease. Having an HDL level of at least 60 may help protect you from getting heart disease. Of course, other things -- like not smoking, being active, eating a healthy diet, and staying at a healthy weight -- also matter for your heart's health. Many of those things also affect your HDL level. Some diet and lifestyle changes help boost HDL cholesterol levels: Get active. Physical activity can boost your HDL level. Get at least 30 minutes a day of moderate activity, most days of the week. Lose extra weight. If you're overweight, losing extra pounds can help raise your HDL levels, as well as cut your LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels. Choose better fats. The healthier choices are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. You'll find these in plants, nuts, and fish like salmon or tuna. And, like everything you eat, keep your portion sizes small. Fats pack a lot of calories in small amounts. Alcohol in moderation. Drinking moderate amounts of alcohol is linked to higher HDL levels. If you don't drink now, check with your doctor before you start, since alcohol has some risks not related to cholesterol. Stop smoking. Kicking the cigarette habit can raise your HDL level."
373,"It's never too late to start a bone-healthy exercise program, even if you already have osteoporosis.  You may worry that being active means you're more likely to fall and break a bone. But the opposite is true. A regular, properly designed exercise program may actually help prevent falls and fractures. That's because exercise strengthens bones and muscles and improves balance, coordination, and flexibility. That's key for people with osteoporosis. Before you start a new workout routine, check with your doctor and physical therapist. They can tell you what's safe for your stage of osteoporosis, your fitness level, and your weight. There is no single exercise plan that's best for everyone with osteoporosis. The routine you choose should be unique to you and based on your: Fracture risk Muscle strength Range of motion Level of physical activity Fitness Gait Balance Your doctor also will consider any other health problems that have a bearing on your ability to exercise, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. She may refer you to a specially trained physical therapist who can teach you exercises that focus on body mechanics and posture, balance, resistance weights, and other techniques. Don't let the name fool you -- these types of workouts aren't about pumping iron. They are exercises you do on your feet so that your bones and muscles have to work against gravity to keep you upright. Your bones react to the weight on them by building themselves up and getting stronger. There are two types of weight-bearing exercise: high-impact and low-impact. High-impact includes workouts like: Brisk walking Climbing stairs Dancing Hiking Jogging Jumping rope Step aerobics Tennis or other racquet sports Yard work, like pushing a lawnmower or heavy gardening But be careful. High-impact weight-bearing exercises may not be safe for you if you have a higher chance of breaking a bone. Talk to your doctor about your workout routine. She may recommend that you focus on low-impact exercises that are less likely to cause fractures and still build up your bone density. These include: Elliptical training machines Low-impact aerobics Stair-step machines Walking (either outside or on a treadmill machine) If you're new to exercise or haven't worked out for a while, you should aim to gradually increase the amount you do until you get to 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise per day on most days of the week. Working your muscles matters just as much as building up bone. It can slow the bone loss that happens with osteoporosis and may help prevent fall-related fractures. These workouts can include basic moves such as standing and rising on your toes, lifting your own body weight with exercises like push-ups or squats, and using equipment such as: Elastic exercise bands Free weights Weight machines Add strength-training exercises to your workouts 2 to 3 days per week. These moves don't directly strengthen your bones. They can, though, improve your coordination, flexibility, and muscle strength. That will lower the chance that you'll fall and break a bone. You can do these every day. Balance exercises such as Tai Chi can strengthen your leg muscles and help you stay steadier on your feet. Posture exercises can help you work against the ""sloping"" shoulders that can happen with osteoporosis and lower your chances of spine fractures. Routines such as yoga and Pilates can improve strength, balance, and flexibility in people with osteoporosis. But some of the moves you do in these programs -- including forward-bending exercises -- can make you more likely to get a fracture. If you're interested in these workouts, talk with your doctor and ask your physical therapist to tell you the moves that are safe and those you should avoid. Exercise can benefit almost everyone with osteoporosis. But remember it's only one part of a good treatment plan. Get plenty of calcium and vitamin D in your diet, stay at a healthy weight, and don't smoke or drink too much alcohol. You also may need osteoporosis medications to either build or maintain your bone density. Work with your doctor to figure out the best ways to stay healthy and strong."
374,"Doctors used to tell people with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) to stay off their feet -- that exercise would make their symptoms worse. Today though, the thinking is quite different. Studies have shown that a light, supervised exercise routine is an important piece of PAH treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation can help you work up to a more active lifestyle. It's a program that can help you manage your condition, build up your stamina, and handle breathlessness when it happens. It's not a substitute for medicine and other treatment, but it can help you breathe better and stay healthy. It's a program that will help you exercise and learn better ways to control your breathing and save your energy. You'll go to a hospital or an outpatient rehab center and work with a training physical therapist. They can guide you through forms of light exercise like walking, riding a stationary bicycle, climbing stairs, lifting light dumbbells, and stretching. They'll teach you how to keep control of your breath while you're working out. You'll start exercising at a level you can handle and work up from there. Depending on the exact program, sessions could be daily or a few times a week and last 30-60 minutes each time. Once you know how to safely do the exercises, you might be able to keep up the routine at home. As you get stronger and build your endurance, you'll be able to do longer workouts. You might even surprise yourself with how long you can last. For some rehab programs, exercise training is the only offering. Other programs also offer group or one-on-one sessions to teach you better ways to breathe when you're active or during stressful times. You might learn how to feel more in control of your breath and other ways to manage PAH symptoms. You may also learn more about: How your medicines work How oxygen therapy works How to quit smoking Proper nutrition How to get the emotional support you need Studies have shown that a course of pulmonary rehab for 10 to 15 weeks can help people with PAH lead more active lives with their disease. People could walk farther in 6 minutes, had better stamina, a lower heart rate, and even lower blood pressure. Plus, the rehab improved their day-to-day life, making them less likely to feel depressed and run-down. Your doctor can help you decide if a rehab program might help you. They'll talk with you about how healthy you are, how well your lungs work, and how well you can do basic daily tasks and the activities you love. If your PAH medicines are working well, pulmonary rehab might ease your symptoms even more. But if you've recently fainted during exercise, your symptoms have gotten worse, or your medications aren't helping, your doctor will probably suggest that you wait before you try this type of program. People with PAH are more likely to have a fast, fluttering heartbeat, chest pain, lightheadedness, and dizziness during exercise than other people. This is why it's important to work with a trained doctor or therapist who can tailor routines to your health and watch you while you exercise. But if pulmonary rehab is done correctly, the benefits often outweigh the risks."
375,"Malaria is a serious and sometimes life-threatening tropical disease that spreads through parasites. It kills more than 445,000 people a year, many of them children in Africa. Although malaria is almost wiped out in the United States, you can still get the disease when you travel to other parts of the world. The United States has about 1,700 malaria cases every year from immigrants and travelers returning from countries where malaria is more common. These countries have warmer climates that are hot enough for the malaria parasites and the mosquitoes that carry them to thrive. These regions include sub- Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Before you travel, check the CDC's website to see whether your destination is a hotspot for malaria. You may have to take pills before, during, and after your trip to lower your chances of getting it. Malaria can cause high fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms that can be life-threatening when not treated quickly. The disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are carried by Anophelesmosquitoes. Only female mosquitoes spread the malaria parasites. When a mosquito bites a person who already has malaria, it sucks up the person's blood, which contain the parasites. When the mosquito bites its next victim, it injects the parasites into that person. That's how the disease is spread. Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver, where they multiply. They invade your red blood cells, which are important cells in your blood that carry oxygen. The parasites get inside them, lay their eggs, and multiply until the red blood cell bursts. This releases more parasites into your bloodstream. As they attack more of your healthy red blood cells, this infection can make you feel very sick. There are five species of Plasmodium parasites that affect humans. Two of them are considered the most dangerous: P. falciparum. This is the most common malaria parasite in Africa, and it causes the most malaria-related deaths in the world. P. falciparum multiplies very quickly, causing severe blood loss and clogged blood vessels. P. vivax . This is the malaria parasite most commonly found outside of sub- Saharan Africa, especially in Asia and Latin America. This species can lie dormant, then rise up to infect your blood months or years after the mosquito bite. Symptoms for malaria usually start about 10 to 15 days after the infected mosquito bite. Here are some things to keep in mind, though: Because the signs are so similar to cold or flu symptoms, it might be hard to tell what you have at first. Malaria symptoms don't always show up within 2 weeks, especially if it's a P. vivax infection. People who live in areas with lots of malaria cases may become partially immune after being exposed to it throughout their lives. A blood test can confirm whether you have malaria. Along with high fever, shaking chills and sweating, symptoms can include: Throwing up or feeling like you're going to Headache Diarrhea Being very tired (fatigue) Body aches Yellow skin (jaundice) from losing red blood cells Kidney failure Seizure Confusion Malaria can cause you to go into a coma. Children with severe malaria may get anemia, a condition that happens when you lose too many red blood cells. They may also have trouble breathing. In rare cases they can get cerebral malaria, which causes brain damage from swelling. Given how quickly malaria can become life-threatening, it's important to get medical care as quickly as possible. Young children, infants, and pregnant women have an especially high chance for severe cases of malaria. Seek care if you're getting high fever while living in or traveling to an area that has high chance for malaria. You should still get medical help even if you see the symptoms many weeks, months or a year after your travel."
376,"Is there any way to eliminate the âcottage cheeseâ on your thighs and rear end? No, not really. But there are steps you can take to get rid of cellulite.. It's just normal fat beneath your skin. It looks lumpy because it pushes against connective tissue, causing the skin above it to pucker. That's why you can have it whether you're heavy or thin. Women are more likely to get it than men.

This noninvasive procedure freezes and kills fat cells. Once they're dead, your body naturally removes them. This treatment is usually used for body shaping, but fat removal can also improve your cellulite. It can take three treatments and 3 or 4 months for you to see results. Also called radiofrequency systems, they show promise for cellulite. Treatment usually mixes massage, liposuction, or light therapy. It can liquefy fat, cut connective tissue to loosen puckering, boost collagen growth and skin tightening, increase blood flow, and lessen fluid retention. Expect results to last at least 6 months. One popular FDA-approved laser treatment is called Cellulaze. The doctor injects numbing solution into the area, then puts a laser under your skin. It shoots heat in three directions. You can expect about a 75% improvement in your cellulite for about a year. Most options are based on the idea that massaging the problem area will increase blood flow and reduce fluid buildup. The result: Better-looking hips and buttocks. Endermologie (or lipomassage or endermology) is a specific type of mechanical massage. A machine with low-pressure suction kneads your skin between two spinning rollers. The theory is that the deep massage will break up the connective tissue that causes dimples. Most studies show that massage techniques, including endermologie, make your skin look better for a short time but offer no long-term benefit. Some experts worry that the suction can cause your skin to slacken prematurely, making it look worse. This is a low-energy version of the technology that treats kidney stones. It's a noninvasive treatment that's given twice a week for 6 or more weeks. It could give results for 2 to 6 months, but more research about how well it works and how long results may last is needed. People of all sizes can have cellulite. But if you're overweight, the most effective treatment is to shed extra pounds and tone your body. Eat less and add more cardio and strength training exercise. Lift weights at least 2 days a week. Focus on your legs, hips, and backside. Strong, defined muscles under a thinner fat layer will make your skin smoother and less puckered. This minimally invasive procedure can improve your cellulite. Results have been shown to last for at least 2 years. The doctor marks the area, injects a numbing solution, and then inserts a tiny blade to cut the connective tissue that holds your fat onto those dimples. A hand-held device called Cellfina was approved in 2015 to make this procedure more precise. It provides vacuum-assisted control of the depth and area treated. About 20 to 30 individual cellulite dimples are treated during an average 1-hour session. Results can last up to 2 years. A variety of creams on the market claim to reduce cellulite. Many have ingredients intended to promote fat breakdown (caffeine, aminophylline, theophylline). Others contain vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts. Generally, these products offer little benefit alone, but they may add some value when combined with other treatments. Some evidence suggests that retinol cream can help with cellulite, but the results aren't great. Twice-daily application of a 0.3% retinol cream for 6 months can thicken your skin and reduce that orange-peel look. Injectables. Some doctors inject chemicals into the fat layer below the skin to encourage breakdown and make cellulite less noticeable. This procedure is often called mesotherapy. The chemicals used include phosphatidylcholine, aminophylline, hormones, herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals. There's little proof these treatments help. Most doctors don't recommend the procedure because there's a risk of infection, swelling, rashes, and lumpy skin. Liposuction. This fat removal procedure is often used on the thighs, buttocks, and abdomen. However, it can actually make the dimpled fat left behind look worse."
377,"Rheumatoid arthritis doesn't have to change your ""to do"" list. Some simple fixes can make it easier to get things done. Have a plan. When you have RA, you may have less energy. So it helps to be well organized. If you want to get things done tomorrow, plan how you'll do it now. Keep your goals realistic, and don't forget to build in breaks. Save your energy. What slows you down? Putting on your shoes? Getting ready in the morning? Once you know the things that get you stuck, you can come up with ways to make them easier. Divide up the day. Spend 30 minutes on a task, then do something else. Focusing too much on one thing could leave you feeling achy and fatigued afterward. If you switch things up, you'll get more done. Pace yourself -- especially on good days. Even if you wake up feeling like you can do anything, squeezing in too much can backfire. If you overdo it -- going on a hike or gardening all afternoon -- your fatigue the next day could set you back. Tackle a high-energy task or two in the morning, take a nap at lunchtime, and do lighter work in the afternoon. Use a stool. Don't stand while you cook. Sit and rest. You can wash dishes from a stool, too. Cook simpler meals. Stick with easy recipes, especially after work. Use shortcuts like pre-cut vegetables. Save dishes with lots of steps for weekends or nights when a family member can help. Or split up the cooking over 2 days. Get new kitchenware. The right kitchen tools will speed up dinner prep and spare your joints. Think about buying some lightweight pots and pans and spoons and spatulas with thick, easy-to-grip handles. Go gadget shopping. Think about what's hard or painful in the bathroom, and pick up a few aids to help out. Is it hard to squeeze out toothpaste? Look for an automatic dispenser. Do you have hip pain? A raised toilet seat can be much more comfortable. Wide-handled toothbrushes and hairbrushes, grab bars, and soap in pump bottles can make life easier. An occupational therapist can help you with the tasks of daily life. Use a shower chair. Even if you think you don't really need one, it can help you relax while you bathe without putting more stress on your joints. A showerhead that you can adjust or hold in your hand can help, too. Change your wardrobe. Make getting dressed smoother by choosing clothes that are easier to put on, or adapt the clothes you already have. Bigger buttons, Velcro fasteners, elastic shoelaces, and rings for zipper pulls can make it faster to dress. So can tools like a long-handled shoehorn. Lift carefully. Use both hands when you pick up a gallon of milk or a jug of laundry detergent. Also, slide a heavy object instead of lifting it when possible. Get laundry baskets with wheels, too. Don't lug cleaning supplies up and down the stairs. Keep a stocked supply closet on each floor. Instead of carrying your vacuum, think about a lightweight rechargeable vacuum for each floor, too. Garden without pain. Instead of crouching or kneeling on the ground, sit on a low stool while you're working outside. Some benches have wheels that make them easier to move. Try working on raised beds instead of on the ground. Also, look for ergonomic garden tools that are easier to use. Shop online. It's easier and faster than trekking to the mall. Save your energy for the things you enjoy doing. If using a keyboard hurts, consider getting voice recognition software to do your online buying."
378,"Your body makes hyaluronic acid. It's a natural part of the fluid that helps lubricate and cushion your joints and keeps them working smoothly. When you have osteoarthritis ( OA), the hyaluronic acid in the affected joint thins. Hyaluronic acid injections add to your body's natural supply. You may hear your doctor refer to these injections as ""viscosupplementation,"" which literally means they help the fluid in your joints. Doctors can't predict who will benefit from hyaluronic acid injections. But many doctors give them to people with knee OA whose symptoms don't get better with painkillers or non-drug treatments such as heat or ice. Hyaluronic injections are also often tried by people who can't take painkillers like acetaminophen ( Tylenol), ibuprofen ( Advil or Motrin), or naproxen sodium ( Aleve) or can't have (or aren't ready for) total knee replacement surgery. Studies show hyaluronic acid injections may work better than painkillers for some people with OA. Other studies have shown they also may work as well as corticosteroid knee injections. Hyaluronic acid injections seem to work better in some people than others. They may be less effective in older adults and people with severe OA. Among the brands of hyaluronic acid are approved for knee OA: Euflexxa Hyalgan Orthovisc Monovisc Supartz Synvisc, Synvisc- One Depending on which type your doctor uses, you may get a single shot. Or you'll get three to five injections spaced a week apart. The injection is given the same way for all types. First, the doctor cleans the area. If your knee is swollen with excess fluid, your doctor may inject a local painkiller, then insert a needle into the joint to withdraw excess fluid. With the same needle still in place, the doctor can usually inject the hyaluronic acid into the knee joint. After an injection, you shouldn't do hard weight-bearing activity for one or two days. Otherwise, you should be able to resume normal activities. Most insurance companies cover hyaluronic acid injections. The most common short-term side effects are minor pain at the injection site and minor buildup of joint fluid. These get better within a few days. Infrequently the injected joint may flare up with increased inflammation."
379,"HIV doesn't just affect your immune system. The virus can harm other parts of your body, too. Also, the drugs you take to treat HIV can have side effects. You'll need to watch for trouble and take steps to prevent or slow the damage. Some eye problems are mild, while others can be severe enough to cause blindness. Among the most common are infections, which can lead to bleeding in the retina (the tissue at the back of your eye) and retinal detachment. About 7 out of 10 people with advanced AIDS will have trouble with their eyes. You may not have any symptoms until the problems are far along, so if you have advanced HIV, it's important to get regular eye exams. And call your doctor if your vision changes, including: You get blurry or double vision, or colors don't look right. You see spots. You have watery or red eyes. You're sensitive to light. Your eyes hurt. Several things raise your chance of heart-related problems. Because HIV affects your immune system, your body will be inflamed as it tries to fight the infection, like a constant low simmer. This kind of inflammation has been linked to heart disease. Some drugs you take for HIV can also make heart disease more likely. They can cause insulin resistance, which raises your odds of diabetes, and problems breaking down fats. And these lead to heart disease. You might need to take more medicines to control your diabetes and cholesterol. Follow instructions for your prescriptions carefully. If you smoke, quit. Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits, plenty of whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids. Choose lean cuts of meat and low-fat dairy products. Exercise, like a brisk walk, for 20-30 minutes most days of the week. If you're carrying extra weight, losing as little as 5 or 10 pounds could make a big difference. High blood pressure and diabetes are major causes of kidney disease. The healthy diet and regular exercise that's good for your heart will also help keep your blood pressure and blood sugar under control, which will help protect your kidneys, too. Some HIV medications can cause kidney damage. If you already have kidney problems, your doctor may want to avoid those drugs or keep a close eye on their effects. Your doctor will need to check your kidneys regularly because signs of kidney disease may not be obvious. Your kidneys can be checked by routine blood tests Some HIV medications also have liver-damaging side effects. Many people with HIV also have some form of hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver. Be kind to your liver: Limit your alcohol intake, and don't use recreational drugs. Diabetes, high cholesterol or triglycerides, and being overweight can lead to fatty liver disease, so watch the extra carbs, fats, and calories. Talk to your doctor about vaccinations against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. There is no vaccine against Hepatitis C, but you should get tested for it. Get regular bloodliver tests to catch any liver problems early. People with HIV tend to lose bone faster than healthy people. Your bones may get brittle and can break more easily. Your hips, especially, may hurt and feel weak. It could be from the virus itself or the inflammation it causes, medicines you take to fight HIV or related illnesses (like steroids or antacids), or an unhealthy lifestyle. It might also be from a vitamin D deficiency, which is common in persons with HIV. To help preserve your bones: Make sure you get plenty of calcium and vitamin D. Exercise in ways that put weight on your bones, like walking, or doing strength training. Don't smoke and limit your alcohol intake. Ask your doctor to check your vitamin D level. Ask your doctor if you should take supplements or other medications to help your bones. If you have advanced HIV, you're more likely to get infections that can cause inflammation in your brain and spinal cord. That can lead to confusion and other thinking problems as well as weakness, headaches, seizures, and balance problems. When AIDS is very far along, you can get dementia and have problems remembering things. Having HIV can also affect your mental health. Many people living with it have depression or anxiety. Try to stay as healthy as possible. Take your medications as prescribed, and let your doctor know about any new symptoms or changes."
380,"When fighting brain cancer, your health care team will discuss details about home care with you and your family members. Home care usually includes supportive measures, depending on your symptoms and individual needs. For example, if you have trouble walking, physical and occupational therapists can help you improve movement and use equipment to aid in daily activities. A speech therapist can help with problems related to speaking and swallowing. Home health aides are specially trained to help with personal care tasks such as bathing, dressing, and eating. Home care can also include nurses to give medicines, provide wound care, and monitor side effects. If the prognosis is poor, it is appropriate to discuss options that include hospice care, advance directives to doctors, and provisions for a living will. Home hospice care is a way of providing pain and symptom relief, as well as emotional and spiritual support for the patient and the family, at home rather than in the hospital. It involves a multidisciplinary approach that may include a doctor or other health care provider, nurses, a pharmacist, aides, a social worker, a spiritual caregiver, and counselors. Advance directives are legal documents that provide a means to express your wishes for treatment and your choice on the person you want to make decisions on your behalf if you are not able to do so. Types of advance directives include a living will and durable power of attorney for health care. For example, a person with advanced brain cancer may not want to be put on a ventilator (breathing machine) if he or she stops breathing. You have the right to make these decisions for yourself as long as you are mentally competent."
381,"You can easily get dehydrated if you have diarrhea or vomiting that doesn't quickly go away. Dehydration means that your body doesn't have enough fluid to work the right way. You can take steps to help prevent this from happening. And you'll want to know what to do, just in case. With diarrhea or vomiting, you lose fluid quickly. So you need to take in as much fluid as you can. Drink plenty of water. Exactly how much you need to replenish depends on how much you've lost. If you have certain medical conditions such as heart failure, you may have to limit how much you drink. Ask your doctor how much is OK for you. If you're nauseated, it may be hard to keep fluids down. You can sip water, suck on ice, or try a frozen ice pop. These methods will help you stay hydrated without having to drink as much. Being thirsty isn't the only clue that you're dehydrated. For adults, other signs include: You pee less often than normal. Your urine is dark-colored. You have muscle cramps. You're easily fatigued. You feel light-headed. You don't sweat as much as normal. By the time these symptoms show up, dehydration may be far along. At the first sign of diarrhea or vomiting, you need to start to replace lost water and the salts you need called electrolytes. Water is just part of the answer. It rehydrates the body. But you'll still need the salts. If you have diarrhea or if you're vomiting, most experts recommend drinking rehydration solutions -- special fluids that give your body salt and water. You can also drink juice that has some potassium and broth for sodium -- they aren't substitutes for rehydration solutions, but they may help mild dehydration not become worse. Your doctor can also prescribe nausea medicine if your nausea and vomiting are severe. Call your doctor if diarrhea or vomiting lasts for more than 2 days. Call sooner if there's a fever or pain in the abdomen or rectum, if stool appears black or tarry, or if signs of dehydration appear. Kids can lose a lot of fluid in a short time from diarrhea or vomiting. Along with the usual signs of dehydration (listed above), parents of sick infants and children should also watch for: Dry mouth and tongue No tears when crying Tiredness or crankiness Sunken cheeks or eyes Sunken fontanel (the soft spot on the top of a baby's head) Fever or vomiting Not passing as much pee or poop as usual Skin doesn't bounce back normally when you gently pinch and release it Call your doctor if you notice these signs or if your child's diarrhea lasts more than 24 hours. If your sick child shows signs of dehydration, give him oral rehydration solutions such as Ceralyte, Infalyte, or Pedialyte. Sports drinks and fruit juices are helpful too, but they don't have the best balance of water, sugar, and salt. If your child has diarrhea and isn't vomiting, you can offer small amounts of these drinks often until he starts to make normal amounts of urine again. Seniors are more likely to get dehydrated because their sense of thirst may not be as sharp as it used to be. Age-related changes in the body's ability to balance water and sodium can also lead to dehydration. And some may take diuretics or other medicines that affect their body's balance of water and salt. The most important thing is for elderly people to drink a lot of fluid, but in small amounts and very often, including when they have diarrhea or vomiting."
382,"Ulcers are sores that are slow to heal or keep returning. They can take many forms and can appear both on the inside and the outside of your body. They can be found on places of your body you can see, such as a leg ulcer found on the skin, or in places you can't see, such as a peptic ulcer in the lining of your stomach or upper intestine. From your eye to your foot, you can get them just about anywhere on your body. Injuries, diseases, and infections can cause them. What they look like depends on where you have them and how you got them. While some go away on their own, others cause serious problems if you don't treat them. These can be painful and may take months to heal. They vary in how they look, from red splotches that ooze to darkened patches of swollen skin. What causes them? Most start with an injury that doesn't heal well because of some other health issue -- usually, a blood flow problem. If you have problems with your veins, you can get venous ulcers, the most common kind on your legs. You're more likely to get them if you have: A history of blood clots in your legs You've had swelling in your legs before Limited ability to move around Osteoarthritis (when cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down) Varicose veins If you have problems with your arteries, such as plaque buildup (atherosclerosis), you may get arterial ulcers. Typically, you get these on your feet and toes. Diabetes can cause nerve and blood flow problems that lead to ulcers. They usually show up on your feet. When you have diabetes, it's best to check your feet for even minor injuries every day. What problems can they lead to? If untreated, leg and foot ulcers can lead to: Infection Having a foot or part of your leg removed (sometimes a problem with diabetic ulcers) Osteoporosis (when your bones become weak and easily break in a fall) Also called pressure ulcers or pressure sores, at first they just look like off-color skin. Over time though, they can grow into deep, open wounds. What causes them? You get bedsores when prolonged pressure on your skin leads to blood flow problems. You're more likely to get them if you have a condition that makes it hard for you to move and you're forced to lie down or sit most of the time. An example is when you've had surgery that requires bed rest for a long time. What problems can they lead to? Bedsores can cause: Bone and joint infections Cancer in your skin's upper layers Cellulitis, a painful infection in your skin and soft tissue Flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis), a life-threatening infection Sepsis, a life-threatening problem where bacteria get into your blood and move throughout your body These are painful sores on the penis, vagina, or anus. What causes them? They're usually caused by sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes, syphilis, and chancroid (in which bacteria cause skin ulcers to form, usually on the genitals). They may also be caused by an injury or a reaction to a skin care product. What problems can they lead to? Open sores on your genitals make you more likely to give or get sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs), including HIV. These show up on the cornea, which is the surface of your eye. They may cause redness and pain, and you may feel like you have something stuck in your eye. What causes them? Typically, you get a corneal ulcer from an infection. You might also get it because of dry-eye syndrome, an injury to your cornea, or problems with your eyelids which can cause your corneas to dry out and form ulcers. What problems can they lead to? They can cause serious vision problems, including blindness. If you think you have one, it's best to get treatment right away. One type of ulcer you can't see is a peptic ulcer. You can get them in your stomach or the upper part of your small intestine. For most people, stomach pain is the first clue they have one. What causes them? Normally, you have just the right amount of stomach acid to break down your food. But if something throws your stomach off, the acid can eat away at its lining and cause an ulcer. This can happen because of: H. pylori, a type of bacteria Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). These include aspirin, ibuprofen ( Motrin and Advil), and naproxen ( Aleve and Naprosyn). Acetaminophen ( Tylenol) doesn't cause this problem. Use of some medicines, such as steroids and a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), used to treat depression. What problems can they lead to? If not treated, peptic ulcers can cause: Bleeding inside your body Blockages that keep food from moving out of your stomach Infection Also called canker sores, these small, round sores may be red, yellow, or gray. They show up inside your cheeks and lips, as well as on your tongue and gums. They're different from cold sores that you may get around the outside of your mouth. What causes them? Certain conditions, such as celiac disease (an immune reaction eating gluten) or Crohn's (a bowel disease that causes inflammation), can give you mouth ulcers. They can also be caused by trauma, sensitivity to foods with lots of acid, changes in your hormone levels, or not enough vitamins. What problems can they lead to? Usually, mouth ulcers are harmless and go away on their own. Check with your doctor if they last more than 3 weeks, you keep getting them, or they get redder and more painful."
383,"The most obvious symptom of shingles is a painful, blistering rash on one side of your body. You may have other problems with it, too. Learn all the signs so you'll have a better idea of when you should call your doctor. The same virus, called varicella zoster, causes both chickenpox and shingles. With chickenpox, the virus leaves an itchy, spotted rash all over your body. After you get over it, the virus stays inside your body. It goes into a sleep-like state. Years later, it can ""wake up"" and cause shingles. The first sign of shingles, which is also called herpes zoster, is pain that might feel like burning or tingling on one side of your face, chest, back, or waist. It can be intense. You might also feel like you're coming down with the flu, with symptoms such as: Fever Chills Fatigue Headache A few days later, you may see a rash in the spot where you felt the pain. It's usually only on one side of your body or face, but it can, in rare cases, form on your face or all over your body. The condition also: Causes a sharp, stabbing, or burning pain Sometimes itches Feels very sensitive to the touch At first, the rash looks like little bumps. In 2 to 3 days, you may see fluid-filled blisters. They grow bigger and pop open. Then a hard crust forms on top of them. After a few days, the scabs fall off. The shingles rash should fade after 2 to 4 weeks. But the skin underneath the rash might change color and always stay that way. The pain can last for months or years. This complication is called postherpetic neuralgia. The feeling can be intense. The rash can spread to your nose or around one eye. If the virus gets into your eye, it could affect your vision. Shingles can damage your cornea, the clear layer in the front. Signs that you have it in your eye can include: Pain Redness Swelling Sensitivity to light One way to help tell shingles from an allergy or other type of rash is by its other symptoms. It can cause flu-like symptoms, such as: Chills Diarrhea Fever Headache Nausea Stomach ache These can range from mild to severe. People 50 and older are more likely to have more severe effects than those who are younger. Call your doctor if you have pain or a rash on one side of your head or body. You should see an eye doctor if: The rash is around your nose or eye Your eyes are red or painful You have any vision problems"
384,"If you want to start a family, having multiple sclerosis ( MS) doesn't have to stop you. It doesn't keep you from getting pregnant or hurt your unborn baby. Odds are your pregnancy and delivery will be just like women without MS. Still, moms-to-be with MS face unique challenges. Plan ahead and learn what to do before, during, and after pregnancy to make your next 9 months a little easier. Talk to your doctor. Let her know you want to have a baby. If your MS is under control, you'll probably get a green light. Some MS drugs, like glatiramer acetate ( Copaxone), teriflunomide ( Aubagio), and interferons, aren't safe during pregnancy. You'll need to stop taking them at least 1 month before you start trying. Time it right. Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away. To limit the time you're off your medicine, try to learn your âfertility window.â That's the time of the month when you're most likely to conceive. You can buy an ovulation kit at the drugstore to help you figure it out. Your doctor can recommend other ways to help your timing, too. Build a support team. MS can wear you out, and pregnancy can, too. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends to fix meals or help around the house so you can save your energy. Make sure your team is ready to pitch in after the baby comes, too. Expect some relief. You may get a break from your MS symptoms. That's because pregnancy naturally protects many women from new flares, especially after the first 3 months. So enjoy it! Focus on getting the right foods, exercise, and plenty of rest. Watch out for urinary tract infections ( UTIs). They are more common for pregnant women with MS. Drink lots of water, and tell your doctor if you feel burning when you go to the bathroom or if your urine is cloudy or smelly. You may get monthly urine tests to check for UTIs. You also may have trouble with constipation. A stool softener can get things moving. Prop yourself up. As you get bigger, your balance may be off. Use a cane or other walking aid so you don't fall. Prepare for your special delivery. Chances are you'll be able to give birth just like any other woman. If you can't push because of fatigue or muscle weakness, your doctor may use special tools to help you deliver naturally. Or you might need a C-section. You might not know when labor starts if you have lost feeling in your pelvis. In that case, your doctor will watch you more closely during the last month. She may want to use drugs or other procedures to put you in labor. Medicines to block pain, including injections called epidurals, are safe for people with MS. If you want one, tell your doctor. Be aware of flares. In the first 9 months after birth, up to 40% of women with MS will have a relapse. But a flare doesn't raise your risk of a long-term disability. If you had many flares before pregnancy, you may be more likely to have one now. It may be a good idea to start taking your MS medicine right away to help stop one. Think carefully about breastfeeding. If you go back on your meds, you won't be able to do it. The drugs could harm your baby through your milk. But if your doctor says it's OK to wait to take your medicine, breastfeed if you want to. It's perfectly safe for you and great for your little one. Store the milk you pump in the fridge so your partner can tackle middle-of-the night feedings. You need your rest now more than ever. Don't feel guilty if you choose medication over breastfeeding. After all, your new addition needs a mom who can stay healthy. Mind your mood. Women with MS have a higher risk of depression during pregnancy and especially right after they give birth. Call your doctor if you start to notice any symptoms, like feeling sad or hopeless. Your ob-gyn may also screen you for depression during a routine prenatal or postpartum visit. Your doctor can help treat your depression symptoms. Will your baby grow up to have MS? It's a common concern for many parents-to-be. MS does have some genetic links, but the adult children of parents with the condition have a 96% chance they won'thave it."
385,"Has your blood pressure been creeping up? If so, you may be at decision time: Do you need medicine right now or can you get those numbers down with healthier habits? There isn't always a clear answer. A lot depends on how high your blood pressure is and your general health. Your age also plays a role. Learn how you and your doctor can figure out when lifestyle changes are enough and when she needs to pull out the prescription pad. The first step is to look at your numbers. Blood pressure is always shown with a top and bottom number -- like 130/90. The top number tells you the pressure when your heart beats. The bottom number lets you know the pressure between beats. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 and less than 80. If one or both of those numbers is higher, there's too much pressure in your arteries. It's like a tire pumped with too much air. Over time, the extra pressure can cause damage -- and raise your chances of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. So on the blood pressure range, where do your numbers fall? Your blood pressure is higher than you want, but it's not full-on high blood pressure. Unless you also have another health condition -- like kidney disease or heart problems -- your doctor will likely say you don't need drugs for now. But don't ignore it. You're on the path to high blood pressure, so make some changes to your lifestyle. Cut down on salt and alcohol, get more exercise, and drop pounds if you're overweight. These numbers qualify as high blood pressure and you need to take action. But your doctor will probably suggest that you try out lifestyle changes first before adding drugs -- unless you have other health problems. One thing to keep in mind: Guidelines are different for older people. If you're 60 or older, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend you start treatment if your top blood pressure number is 130 or higher. At this level, your doctor is likely to prescribe medicine now to get your blood pressure under control. At the same time, you'll also need to make lifestyle changes. If you ever have blood pressure that's 180/120 or above, it's an emergency. You need medical help right away to get it under control. While your numbers are important, they don't tell the whole story. Other things affect the decision to take meds. Some issues to think about: Do you definitely have high blood pressure? One high reading isn't enough to know. Your doctor will want to check your blood pressure a few more times -- over weeks or months -- to make sure. Have you checked your blood pressure at home, or only in the doctor's office? If you don't already have one, it's a good idea to get a home blood pressure monitor. Lots of people have high blood pressure in the doctor's office because they're nervous. If your home readings are normal, your doctor may decide you don't really need treatment. Have you already tried lifestyle changes -- and your blood pressure is still high? If your blood pressure is still too high after 3 months of healthier habits, your doctor is likely to suggest medicine. Do you also have other health conditions? High blood pressure raises your chances of getting a heart attack or stroke. If you have other medical problems -- like high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart disease -- your doctor will be quicker to recommend medication. Do you have other reasons your chances of heart attacks or strokes are higher? For example, are you African- American? Are you a man? Do you have a family history of heart attacks or strokes at young ages? Are you overweight? Do you smoke? Each one of these raises your odds of heart disease. The more of these situations you have, the more likely your doctor will prescribe high blood pressure medicine. How old are you? While your odds of heart disease go up as you age, the risks of side effects from blood pressure medications -- like dizziness and falls -- can also get more serious. You need to weigh the benefits and risks. If you're age 80 or older and you have high blood pressure, your doctor may hold off on medication to protect you from side effects. What do you want to do? Your opinion matters. Some people choose to take medicine because they're concerned about the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Others don't like the idea of going on daily medication or worry about the side effects. Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons, and be open about how you feel. Remember, high blood pressure has no symptoms. So the only way to know if it's high -- or getting higher -- is to check it regularly. If you and your doctor decide you need medicine, it's not a defeat. Lots of people get high blood pressure eventually. And it's not an excuse to give up on healthy habits either. You'll get the most benefit from your blood pressure drugs if you combine regular exercise, a good diet, and a healthy weight."
386,"Exercise can help ease multiple sclerosis symptoms, but you have to be careful if you want your workouts to work for you. The most important thing: Don't overdo it. No doubt you've heard the sayings ""no pain, no gain"" or ""feel the burn,"" but that isn't good advice when you have MS. Do too much and you can strain your muscles, increase pain, and put too much stress on your body and your mind. Never exercise to the point of fatigue. Check with your doctor before you start any fitness program. He may suggest: Types of exercise that are best for you and those you should avoid. The right moves depend on your symptoms, fitness level, and overall health. How long and intense your workouts should be Any physical limitations for your routines Other professionals, like a physical therapist, who can help you build a personal exercise program that meets your needs Aerobics. Not only does it get your heartbeat up, it lifts your mood, too. Walking, running, and biking are all good. If you have leg weakness or other problems moving, try something like rowing or water aerobics. Stretches. They're good for anyone with MS, but they're most helpful if you have painful muscle stiffness and spasms. Aside from regular stretches, yoga and tai chi are great ways to build strength and flexibility. They can also help you relax and fight stress. Strength training. If your physical therapist says it's OK, use weights or resistance exercises to build your muscles. The stronger you are, the easier it'll be to move around. Take it slow. Always warm up first. Ease into your routine. If all you can manage is a walk around the block -- or across the room -- that's fine. Start with that and keep it up. In time, you'll build up your strength and be able to do much more. Stay safe. Avoid places with slippery floors, poor lighting, throw rugs, or other tripping hazards. Choose activities that won't make it likely for you to fall, like stationary biking or swimming. You may want to have a grab bar or rail nearby. Work with your physical therapist on stretches and strength training to improve your balance and coordination. Know when to quit. If you feel pain or sickness during exercise, stop. If symptoms start to flare up, change or end your routine. Talk to your doctor. While you're healing, get lots of rest. Once you start feeling better, your physical therapist can help get you back on track. Find a balance. If you can do vigorous exercise, that's OK, but make sure your workouts don't make you too weak. If you're so tired or sore afterward that you can't prepare dinner, you need to reassess. On a good day, it's tempting to push yourself, maybe walk an extra mile. But overdoing it today could leave you feeling crummy tomorrow. Stick to your normal pace. Keep it fun: Choose an activity you enjoy. Try water aerobics, swimming, tai chi, and yoga, which often work well for people with MS. Cool down: When you're done, always take time to let your heart rate, body temperature, and breathing get back to normal. If you're sensitive to heat, your symptoms may show up or get worse when your body temperature rises. This will happen when you exercise. To avoid overheating: Don't exercise during the hottest part of the day (10 a.m. to 2 p.m.). Try to work out in the morning or evening if you're exercising outside. Drink plenty of cool water. Be aware of your body. If you notice any symptoms you didn't have before you started exercising, slow down or stop until you cool down. Swimming and water aerobics are good ways to stay cool while you work out. Just make sure there are non-slip floors in the locker room and around the pool."
387,"Facing a prostate cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming. Your stress levels may skyrocket. You may worry about finances. And you may be asking yourself hard questions, such as whether to write a will or to complete advance directives. With education and supportive care, you will be able to deal with the many issues and emotions you're facing. The most important step you can take is to seek help as soon as you feel you are having trouble coping. Taking action early will enable you to understand and deal with the many effects of your chronic illness. Some tips to get you started: Do not hesitate to ask your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider to repeat any instructions or medical terms you don't understand. Your medical team should always be available to answer your questions and address your concerns. Make use of resources and support services offered by your hospital and in the community. Learning more about your disease will help you feel more at ease with your treatment. Ask your family and friends to help you sort through the information you receive. Talk with other patients and families about prostate cancer and its treatment. Many sources of help are available to provide support for patients and their families. These include: Social workers. These professionals can help diminish any concerns you and your family may have about your diagnosis, treatment, or your personal situation. Social workers can also provide education, counseling about lifestyle changes, and referrals to community or national agencies and support groups. Your social worker can also help your family find temporary lodging, provide information about community resources, and help you with other needs. Individual counseling. Sometimes people have problems that are better addressed in a one-on-one setting. By doing individual counseling, you may be better able to express sensitive or private feelings you have about your illness and its impact on your life. Mental health professionals can help you regain a sense of control over your life. At times, if depression is present, medicines other than those treating the physical illness may be prescribed. Palliative care specialists, or those trained in pain management, are also available to create a treatment plan to meet your specific needs. Support groups. Support groups are a very useful sharing experience. They provide an environment where you can learn new ways of dealing with your illness. Sometimes, others who have been through similar experiences can explain things differently than your health care providers. You may also want to share approaches you have discovered with others. And you will gain strength in knowing that you are not facing hardships alone. Remember that others may share information or experiences that do not apply to you. Never replace your doctor's advice with that given by another patient. Financial counselors. Financial counselors are available through your hospital and can help answer questions you may have about financial issues related to your medical care. Information about advance directives, such as living wills and durable power of attorney for health care decisions, are available to you. A living will provides clear instructions regarding a person's choice of extended or aggressive types of medical care, such as whether you wish machines to be used to prolong life, or whether you wish an attempt to be made to restart your heart if it stops. This document is prepared while you are fully competent, in case you become unable to make this decision at a later time. The durable power of attorney for health care decisions gives you the right to appoint another person to speak for you if you become incapable of expressing your medical treatment preference. An attorney should prepare this document so that it conforms to state laws and court precedents. Finally, you may wonder if you should write a will. The answer is yes. No one likes to think about his own mortality, but everyone should have a will to ensure that those who survive you will know how to carry out your wishes regarding your possessions and other aspects of your estate. This document should be prepared with your attorney."
388,"Whether your child with ADHD is young or a teen, you can show them you're firm but fair (and fun) by doing two key things. Encourage good behavior with praise or rewards immediately. Make consequences for bad behavior clear, understood, and consistent. Your approach will depend on your child's age. Organize the day. Have a routine. Let your child know if it's changing or if something unusual is going to happen, like a visit from a relative or a vacation. Set rules and expectations. It's best to do this right before an activity or situation. Use rewards. If your child does something you're proud of, give him a gold star, or give him time for his favorite hobby. Try not to use money, food, or candy for rewards. Engage your child with mind-building activities, such as reading, games, and puzzles. Join in! Use a timer. Some parents find this helps build structure. For example, set a reasonable time limit for a bath or playtime. It helps train your child to expect limitations, even on fun things. Give your child a time limit for doing a chore, too, especially if you reward her for finishing on time. Explain and instruct. Give clear instructions for tasks. If a chore is hard or lengthy, break it down into steps that can be done one at a time. Reward your child for good behavior and tasks completed. Have a clear system for incentives (like a point system or gold stars) so your child knows what to expect when they finish a chore or behave better. Be consistent with your expectations, and always follow through with rewards. Make a plan for discipline. Set up a specific consequence for a certain misbehavior. Be consistent and fair about enforcing it. Try not to discipline your child in front of others. Talk regularly with your child's teachers, so you can deal with any behavior concerns before they become a major problem. Walk your talk. Set a good example for your child. Children with ADHD need role models for good behavior. Involve them. As your child matures, let them help set expectations, rewards, and consequences. This empowers them, which may improve their self-esteem and reinforce the idea that they're in charge of their own behavior. This will also help them become more responsible as they move toward young adulthood. Discipline in private. Teenagers are often sensitive of how they appear to others. So they may overreact or feel ashamed if you discipline them in public. The teen years can be tough for any kid, so be gentle and understanding. Talk with them about any issues they're having. Talk with your teen's teachers when issues in the classroom come up. Talk with your child, too. Make a plan to deal with it, together. Be predictable. Be consistent and fair with how you act. That way, your teen knows what to expect from you. Set a good example. Teens don't always show it, but the adults in their lives are very influential and important to them. All parents find themselves frustrated at times, and raising a child with ADHD has its own set of challenges. It's natural to have needs and questions. When you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone about it. Look for a support group, or see a mental health professional to help you deal with your emotions and reactions so you can be a more effective parent. Family counseling may help, too."
389,"Some people are allergic to latex, which is found in rubber gloves and other products, such as condoms and some medical devices. Doctors don't know what causes it. Coming in contact with latex and rubber products over and over may be part of the reason why it happens. About 5% to 10% of health care workers have some form the allergy. Other people who are more likely than most people to get it include those who have: A defect in their bone marrow cells A deformed bladder or urinary tract Had more than one operation A urinary catheter, which has a rubber tip Allergy, asthma, or eczema Food allergies to bananas, avocados, kiwis, or chestnuts Rubber industry workers and people who use condoms are also more likely than others to get a latex allergy. You can get exposed to latex: Through the skin, such as when you wear latex gloves Through mucous membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, vagina, and rectum Through inhalation. Rubber gloves contain a powder that can be inhaled. Through the blood. This can happen when some medical devices containing rubber are used. There are three types of latex reactions: 1. Irritant contact dermatitis . This is the least-threatening type, and it's not an allergic skin reaction. It usually happens due to repeated exposure to chemicals in latex gloves and leads to dryness, itching, burning, scaling, and skin problems. 2. Allergic contact dermatitis . This is a delayed reaction to additives used in latex processing. It results in the same type of reactions as irritant contact dermatitis. But the reaction is more severe, spreads to more parts of the body, and lasts longer. Symptoms can start up to 4 days after you've come in contact with latex. 3. Immediate allergic reaction (latex hypersensitivity). This one is the most serious. It can show up as a nasal allergy with hay fever-like symptoms, conjunctivitis (pink eye), cramps, hives, and severe itching. It's rare, but symptoms may also include rapid heartbeat, tremors, chest pain, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, or anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. If you have severe symptoms, call your doctor or 911 immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Doctors diagnose a latex allergy in people who: Have had symptoms of an allergic reaction -- like a skin rash, hives, eye tearing or irritation, wheezing, itching, or trouble breathing -- when exposed to latex or a natural rubber product Are known to be at risk for a latex allergy and blood or skin tests show that they have it, even if they haven't had symptoms. If you need a skin test to check on a latex allergy, an allergy specialist must supervise it, in case you have a severe reaction. If the symptoms are irritant contact dermatitis, antihistamine or corticosteroid medicines may be enough to treat the symptoms. If your reaction is severe, you may need epinephrine, IV fluids, and other emergency medical care. If you have a latex allergy, wear a Medic Alertbracelet or another type of ID in case of an emergency. You may also need to carry two epinephrine shots if your doctor recommends that. A allergy to latex can become worse the more you come in contact with it. So if you know you have this condition, be aware of products that may have the potential to cause a reaction. Ask your doctor if you need to avoid them. Many items have latex in them. You may need to ask product makers to be sure. Home goods that are made with latex include: Rubber sink stoppers and sink mats Rubber or rubber-grip utensils Rubber electrical cords or water hoses Bath mats and floor rugs that have rubber backing Toothbrushes with rubber grips or handles Rubber tub toys Sanitary napkins (that contain rubber) Condoms and diaphragms Diapers that contain rubber Adult undergarments that contain rubber Waterproof bed pads containing rubber Undergarments, socks, and other clothing with elastic bands that contain rubber Adhesives such as glue, paste, art supplies, glue pens Older Barbie dolls and other dolls that are made of rubber Rubber bands, mouse and keyboard cords, desktop and chair pads, rubber stamps Mouse and wrist pads containing rubber Keyboards and calculators with rubber keys or switches Pens with comfort grip or any rubber coating Remote controllers for TVs or recording devices with rubber grips or keys Camera, telescope, or binocular eye pieces Bathing caps and elastic in bathing suits Outside the home, latex is also in many items, such as: Grocery store checkout belts Restaurants where workers use latex gloves to prepare food Some balloons Car races that give off tire and rubber particles ATM machine buttons made of rubber Medical products containing latex include: Tourniquets Blood pressure pads EKG pads Some adhesive bandages Dental devices There are many better-bets you can choose instead of latex. These include: Latex Product Alternative Balloons Mylar balloons Baby toys Plastic or cloth toys Bottle nipples Silicone nipples Condoms Sheep cecum condoms (for birth control only) Elastic bands Paper clips, string, or twine Household gloves Synthetic or cotton gloves Raincoat Nylon or synthetic waterproof coats Shoes with rubber Leather or synthetic shoes Telephone cords Clear cords Tell them about your latex allergy at least 24 hours before your appointment. The hospital or doctor's office should have a plan in place so that they can treat you without exposing you to latex. If you have to stay in the hospital, you'll usually be given your own room, free of products that might give you a reaction. Certain ones can trigger a latex-like allergic reaction for some people. They include: Avocado Banana Celery Cherry Chestnut Fig Grape Hazelnut Kiwi Melon Nectarine Papaya Peach Pineapple Plum Potato Rye Tomato Wheat"
390,"If you're looking for a natural remedy to add to your psoriasis treatment plan, coconut oil gets a lot of buzz. There's not a lot of research on whether that's truth or hype, but there are reasons to think it might be another tool for your toolkit. Coconut oil comes from the fruit -- white part -- of a coconut. You can cook and bake with it. And many people use it on their hair and nails as a natural beauty product. It has two forms: refined and unrefined or virgin. Refined coconut oil comes from dried coconut. The oil is taken out under high heat and then goes through a bleaching and deodorizing process. It doesn't smell like coconut -- it has a neutral odor. In the kitchen, you can use it for sautÃ©ing, stir-frying, and baking. Unrefined coconut oil comes from fresh coconut fruit. The process doesn't involve high temperatures, which is why you might see it called ""cold-pressed."" Virgin coconut oil smells like coconuts. You can use it to bake and cook, just like refined coconut oil, but it's best for dishes cooked at lower temperatures. Virgin cold-pressed coconut oil ( VCO) is the kind experts think has the most health benefits, both as part of your diet and for your skin. Because VCO isn't processed with high heat, it keeps more of its germ-fighting power than refined coconut oil. It can: Moisturize Help with inflammation Kill bacteria When you put VCO on your skin, it can help hold in moisture, ease redness and swelling, and keep certain bacteria from growing. Studies show VCO can help with symptoms of eczema (atopic dermatitis), a skin condition that looks a lot like psoriasis. Eczema and psoriasis share many of the same symptoms and even have some of the same triggers. Psoriasis scales tend to be thicker than patches of eczema, but both need moisturizing treatment to help with dryness, scaling, and itching. So even though they're different conditions, VCO can help with both. While it may be a good add-on to your psoriasis treatment plan, coconut oil isn't a stand-alone solution. For psoriasis medications like steroids to work well, it's best to soften the hard scales so the meds can get to the skin below. Coconut oil can help soften and loosen the scales first. Scalp psoriasis tends to have the hardest scales because your hair traps them in place and they're not easy to see or treat. They can get bigger and tougher over time. Here's how to use coconut oil to help with the scales on your scalp: Spread the oil over your scalp, focusing on scaly areas. Gently massage the oil into the scales. Wrap your scalp in a towel or shower cap. Leave it on for 30 to 60 minutes, or overnight. Wash your hair and scalp with normal, anti-dandruff, or tar shampoo. After treating with VCO, it should be easier to loosen and remove some scales gently. Do it while your scalp is still damp and the scales are the softest and loose. Then: Put a plastic comb flat against the scale and gently rub it in a circle. As the scale loosens, try to comb it out of your hair. Wash your hair to remove any leftover scales. Don't pull too hard or too quickly. Doing so can hurt your skin, cause bleeding, or make you lose hair. After you've taken the scaly layer off, apply your prescription treatment."
391,"Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that exists in different forms. Alpha-tocopherol vitamin E is the form that best meets our needs. Vitamin E's main role in the body appears to be neutralizing oxidation. For that reason, researchers think it plays an important role in protecting certain parts of the eye, which is particularly susceptible to oxidative damage. Cataracts, for example, are believed to be formed by oxidation in the lens of the eye caused mostly by UV rays in sunlight. Eye-related benefits: The Age- Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS) found that vitamin E, along with other nutrients, helped some people who had moderate age-related macular degeneration. The nutrients reduced the risk of developing advanced age-related macular degeneration by 25% for those who already had evident early changes of macular degeneration. Evidence from other studies suggests that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E, along with lutein and zeaxanthin, may decrease the risk of cataracts. However, other studies have not found that vitamin E is important for vision, so more research is needed. It's important to talk to your doctor before taking vitamin E supplements in order to discuss the right dose, possible side effects, as well as other treatments. Recommended daily allowance: 22.5 international units/day. Safe upper limit: 1,500 IU Potential risks: Vitamin E can thin your blood, and may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. If you're taking a blood-thinning medication, talk to your doctor before taking a vitamin E supplement. One recent study showed increased mortality in people taking more than 2,000 international units of vitamin E. Other possible side effects cited in studies include fatigue, muscle weakness, and decreased thyroid gland function. Foods with vitamin E: Cereal with wheat germ 27 IU Almonds (1 oz) 11 IU Sunflower seeds (1 oz) 11 IU Hazelnuts (1 oz) 6.4 IU Peanut butter (1 tablespoon) 4 IU Peanuts (1 oz) 3.6 IU"
392,"Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups. Keep all your appointments so your doctors can keep up with how you feel and how well your treatment is working. He may order regular follow-up tests, like: Blood work Lung tests Imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body, like CT scans or chest X-rays Scientists are looking for new ways to fight lung cancer. A clinical trial may be a good option if what you're doing isn't working, especially if you have stage IV cancer. Ask your doctor about any clinical trials for ALK-positive lung cancer. Clinicaltrials.gov is another good place to try. Try typing "" ALK-positive lung cancer"" in the search box. Remember, you're at the heart of your health care team. Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally. It's normal to have strong feelings when you're dealing with cancer. Your doctor can put you in touch with a counselor and support group so you can talk to people who understand what you're going through."
393,"Most ingrown nail problems can be prevented with proper grooming of the toes and by wearing better-fitting shoes. Try to reduce pressure on the toe by wearing sandals or by not wearing a shoe for several days. Avoid trimming the corner of the toenail unless you can easily see and clip the corner of the nail. Otherwise, this can lead to a worsening of the ingrown toenail. If you notice an infection, see your doctor, who may prescribe an antibiotic. In many cases, your doctor may recommend partial removal of a severely ingrown nail. Unless the ingrowing piece of nail is removed, the problem will often persist. Permanent removal of the nail root at the ingrown side may be advised if ingrown nails recur. These procedures are done in the doctor's office or surgery center under a local anesthetic. Sometimes an ingrown nail is caused by a fungus. A doctor can determine if you have a fungus and then offer treatment options."
394,"Rashes in young children can be upsetting, but they're common and often not serious unless there are other symptoms. Your child: Is younger than 6 months Has a fever along with a rash Has a rash that oozes or appears red, swollen, or wet, which could be an infection Has a rash that goes past the diaper area Has a rash that is more serious in skin creases Has a rash that doesn't get better after 2 days Has a rash that peels, especially one on the palms or soles Has flat, small red spots on the skin that don't fade if you press them Looks unwell or is not feeding well Has hives Has bruises not due to an injury Try to figure out whether the rash is due to coming into contact with a common irritant such as poison ivy, chemicals, soaps, nickel jewelry, or a pet. Could it be a diaper rash? Make sure you are changing the diapers frequently and applying protective diaper cream after cleaning the area. If this does not help, see your doctor. Wash the rash with mild soap but don't scrub. Rinse with warm water. Pat the skin dry, rather than rubbing it. Don't cover the rash. Put a wet cloth on the rash to ease pain and itching. Trim your child's fingernails to help prevent scratching. Put soft gloves on your child at night to avoid scratching."
395,"Many people with fibromyalgia continue to work full or part time. But the chronic pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia often make working very difficult. If you are employed, it's important to learn about managing fibromyalgia symptoms and coping with pain and fatigue. In addition, if you have tried different jobs and are unable to work, you might consider applying for disability. Disability may be difficult to get, however, because of rules about work capacity. By self-managing fibromyalgia pain and controlling daily stress, most people with fibromyalgia can do almost anything they choose. Unless you have physical pain that's directly work-related, you should be able to make simple modifications to your workplace that allow you to continue working. First, openly discuss your fibromyalgia with your boss and coworkers. Talk about the symptoms of pain, fatigue, and stiffness. Explain how you may have good days and bad days. Explaining fibromyalgia will give people at work a better idea of what you are feeling each day. Ask your boss if you can take rest periods on bad days. Or ask if you can take work home if you are feeling fatigued. Ask if you can come in on Saturday if you miss a day of work to make up the lost time and income. In addition, ask if you can put a cot in your office for a brief nap at lunchtime. Taking a midday nap helps many people with fibromyalgia and other chronic health conditions function on the job. People with fibromyalgia can use the following lists when talking with their employer about making modifications. The lists come from the U. S. Department of Labor's Job Accommodation Network. They contain recommendations for accommodations employers should be willing to consider for employees with fibromyalgia. To address concentration issues, employers should consider: Providing written job instructions when possible Prioritizing job assignments and providing more structure Allowing flexible work hours and allowing a self-paced workload Allowing periodic rest periods to reorient Providing memory aids, such as schedulers or organizers Minimizing distractions Reducing job stress To address depression and anxiety, employers should consider: Reducing distractions in the work environment Providing to-do lists and written instructions Reminding the employee of important deadlines and meetings Allowing time off for counseling Providing clear expectations of responsibilities and consequences Providing sensitivity training to coworkers Allowing breaks to use stress management techniques Developing strategies to deal with work problems before they arise Allowing telephone calls during work hours to doctors and others for support Providing information on counseling and employee assistance programs To address fatigue and weakness, employers should consider: Reducing or eliminating physical exertion and workplace stress Scheduling periodic rest breaks away from the workstation Allowing a flexible work schedule and flexible use of leave time Allowing the employee to work from home Implementing ergonomic workstation design To address migraine headaches, employers should consider: Providing task lighting Eliminating fluorescent lighting Providing air purification devices Allowing flexible work hours and work from home Allowing periodic rest breaks To address issues associated with sleep problems, employers should consider: Allowing flexible work hours and frequent breaks Allowing the employee to work from home The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA) does not contain a list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA has a general definition of disability that each person must meet. Therefore, some people with fibromyalgia will have a disability under the ADA and others will not. Because fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose -- typically, health care providers rule out other conditions through a physical exam and various blood tests -- it's important that you do your homework before you apply for disability. According to federal regulations, to qualify for disability you must prove that you have a severe impairment. You also need to prove that the impairment limits your physical or mental ability to do work. The Social Security disability regulations define disability as ""the inability to do any substantial gainful activity due to your medical or mental problem."" In addition, according to the Social Security Administration, your condition must interfere with basic work-related activities. If it doesn't, your claim won't be considered. Instead, Social Security will find that you are not disabled. The combined effect of having multiple impairments is taken into account. That can be important for many people with fibromyalgia. You must be unable to do your previous work or any other substantial gainful activity. Your age and education are considered, as well as your remaining abilities and your work experience. To apply for disability benefits, call your Social Security office. Much of the information may be provided over the phone, by mail, or the Internet. You will be asked specific questions about how you have trouble with daily activities. And you will need to be as specific as you can, describing your limitations and why you cannot work. You will be asked to give the names and addresses of your doctors. The Social Security office will contact each one for records. Describing your fibromyalgia symptoms alone will not qualify you for Social Security disability. You have to be specific about signs and physical findings related to fibromyalgia and pain and how that impacts your ability to work. The Social Security staff will consider all your symptoms, including pain. All of this information considered together must lead to a conclusion that you are disabled before you will be granted disability with benefits. If more detailed information is needed, you may have to be examined by a doctor approved by the Social Security Administration. It is common that fibromyalgia patients are not approved for disability, especially with the first application. If you are not approved, you'll have the right to appeal before a judge who specializes in these cases. Some patients with fibromyalgia find it necessary to have the help of an attorney during the appeal process. Although it may increase your costs, the chance your case will be approved is usually better if you have legal counsel. It's important to get detailed documentation -- reports -- from your doctors, including psychologists, at the onset of your illness. Have your doctors submit documentation of all prescribed medications, therapies, and lifestyle remedies necessary to resolve your fibromyalgia symptoms. You should also be evaluated by a fibromyalgia specialist, usually a rheumatologist. This doctor will give a detailed assessment of your impairment along with a list of the many tests and treatments used in your condition. For further details on disability and the steps you must take, visit the Social Security website or call the local Social Security office."
396,"You may ask these common questions if you've just found out you have genital herpes. Find some answers below. It's certainly possible. You can reduce the risk to your partner by having sex only when you have no symptoms. However, the virus can still be contagious without any noticeable symptoms such as sores or a rash on the skin. That's why you should always use a latex condom. A condom does not completely eliminate the risk, because it may not cover an affected area, but it does offer some protection. Taking the antiviral drugs acyclovir ( Zovirax), famciclovir ( Famvir), and valacyclovir ( Valtrex) can make symptoms appear less often and make them less severe. There is some evidence that these drugs also may protect against transmission. There is no cure for genital herpes. Unless scientists find one in the future, you will always have the virus. But taking antiviral drugs can help manage your condition. Ask your doctor about treatment options. Genital herpes can be painful, inconvenient, and upsetting, but it's not considered a life-threatening condition. Even so, it may increase the risk of getting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, because the sores are prime spots for HIV to get into the body. What's more, being infected with HIV and the herpes virus may make both diseases worse. A pregnant woman can pass genital herpes on to her baby, so it's particularly serious during pregnancy. If you get infected near the end of pregnancy, the risk is highest. At least 30% and as many as 50% of newly infected pregnant women give the virus to their babies. For moms who were infected long before delivery, the risk is much lower. Less than 1% of babies born to mothers with an older genital herpes infection get the virus. Also, doctors usually will perform a cesarean section ( C-section) if a woman is having an outbreak at the time of delivery. That depends on the type of herpes virus you have. After being infected, people with herpes simplex virus-1 ( HSV-1) tend to have far fewer and less severe outbreaks than those infected with herpes simplex virus-2 ( HSV-2). Both types can cause genital herpes. Many people never have symptoms, and don't even know they are infected. In those who do have symptoms, how often they will appear and how long they will last varies greatly from person to person. Stress, illness, menstruation, and various other factors can trigger a flare-up. You should tell any sex partner that you have genital herpes. It's important to learn all you can about the condition and share that information. Then you and your partner can make an informed decision about sex. Tell a partner that there is always a chance of getting the virus from you, but that there are ways to reduce the risk, such as using latex condoms and avoiding sex when you have symptoms. There are plenty of reasons why you should communicate openly. Your partner may have infected you, and he or she should know. It may also help your relationship in the long run. Your partner is likely to appreciate honesty. When breaking the news, explain how common genital herpes is: About one in five adults in the U. S. are infected. You can say it's like having cold sores on the mouth (which 50% to 80% of all adults in the U. S. have), except the virus has infected your genitals. It will also help if you're calm when talking to your partner and approach the discussion with a positive attitude: "" I think we can work this out so that we'll both be happy,"" not, "" This will probably tear us apart, but...."" If you were sexually intimate with your partner before you were diagnosed, he or she should be tested for the virus. Many resources are available for people living with genital herpes. A good place to start is the CDC National STD/ HIV Hotline: 1-800-227-8922. Also, talk to your doctor about any concerns you have."
397,"It's every parent's nightmare: a medical emergency involving your child. Whether it's difficulty breathing or a fall at the park, knowing when to call 911 can help you cope quickly and efficiently with childhood emergencies and stay calm under pressure. Here are some guidelines for 7 of the most common medical emergencies in children: 1. Respiratory Distress Respiratory distress refers to difficulty breathing and taking in enough oxygen. Causes may include choking, asthma, an infection, or pneumonia. The signs of respiratory distress are coughing, wheezing, labored breathing (especially flaring of the nose and use of chest and neck muscles to aid breathing), grunting, inability to talk, or turning blue. When to Call 911: The rate of breathing is greater than 50 to 60 breaths per minute. The child is turning blue around the mouth. The condition is worsening instead of improving. If these signs are present, don't try to put your child in a car -- call an ambulance. The paramedics can deliver oxygen and get your child safely to the hospital. 2. Broken Bones Broken bones are common childhood emergencies. While these injuries are usually not life-threatening, the child should be taken to a hospital or urgent care center for evaluation. Generally speaking, parents can drive kids with broken bones to the hospital themselves. When to Call 911: The break is so severe that you can't control the pain. The bone is sticking out of the skin. The accident involves trauma to the head or neck. The accident has caused a state of altered consciousness. 3. Vomiting and/or Diarrhea Vomiting and/or diarrhea can require emergency care if a child becomes dehydrated. If your child can't keep anything down or has severe diarrhea, watch for signs of dehydration such as sunken eyes, dry mucus membranes, and abnormally low amounts of urine. If any of these appear your child should be evaluated by the doctor When to Call 911: The child is unresponsive. There is severe cramping and unrelenting abdominal pain. This could indicate appendicitis or kidney stones, for example. 4. Febrile Seizures In infants and toddlers, a rapid rise in temperature can cause a febrile seizure. Most seizures associated with fever end quickly and are not necessarily emergencies. However, any child who is having new seizures should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible. After a doctor has evaluated your child for seizures, any recurrent seizures should be reported by phone to the doctor to make sure nothing more serious is happening that would require further evaluation. When to Call 911: The seizure doesn't stop after three to five minutes. The child has labored breathing or is turning blue. Your child's normal mental state does not return after the seizure. 5. Falls Falling from a significant height can injure the head, spine, or internal organs. If you suspect a head injury, talk to your child and make sure he or she answers questions appropriately. When to Call 911: The child vomits more than once. He or she loses consciousness. The child complains of numbness or tingling. You suspect internal injuries. You suspect an injury to the neck or spine. In the case of a potential injury to the neck or spine, do not attempt to move your child. The paramedics will immobilize the spine before taking your child to the hospital. 6. Cuts/ Bleeding If your child is bleeding, apply pressure to the wound and assess the extent of the damage. Children who need stitches can usually be taken to the hospital or urgent care center by car. When to Call 911: There is a known bleeding disorder. You're unable to stop the bleeding. 7. Possible Poisoning It's a frightening scenario -- your child has gotten into the medicine cabinet or your supply of household cleaners. The first thing to do is call Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222. The poison center experts can assess a situation and dispense advice quickly. When to Call 911: The child is unresponsive. Poison Control advises it."
398,"If you've ever had a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer, your doctor may have told you that she found polyps. These small clumps of cells that form on your colon lining are usually harmless. But some of them can lead to colon cancer. The most common types of colon polyps doctors remove are a type called tubular adenoma. It can become cancerous, and that danger goes up the bigger the polyps get. Sometimes cells in your body grow out of control, a process called mutation. Some of the abnormal cells can turn into polyps and other types of tumors. Tubular adenomas are often small -- less than 1/2 inch. Just like the name, they grow in a tube shape. You can get a less common but more serious type of polyps called villous adenomas. Instead of round or oval, they look shaggy, like a cauliflower. Some polyps combine the two growth patterns, and they're called tubulovillous adenomas. Almost all colon cancer starts out as polyps. They can grow slowly, over a decade or more. If you have tubular adenomas, they have about 4%-5% chance of becoming cancerous. The odds that villous adenomas will turn out to be dangerous are several times higher. You're more likely to get tubular adenomas if you are: 50 or older Obese Male From a family with history of colon polyps A couch potato You may not know you have tubular adenomas until your doctor finds them during a colonoscopy. But you may notice: Bleeding in your bottom Mucus in your poop Frequent diarrhea or constipation Belly cramps Anemia, from losing blood in your poop During a colonoscopy, your doctor inserts a long, flexible tube with a lens into your rectum and slowly threads it into your colon. She can see the images on a video monitor. Any tubular adenomas will show up as a lump sticking out from the lining of your colon. Your doctor will snip off the polyp or loop a wire around it and burn it off with electric current. You'll be asleep during the procedure, so you won't feel any pain. Your doctor will send the polyp to a lab. A pathologist will check it under a microscope to see how much the sample looks like cancer. No matter what the lab results say, the important thing is that all the polyps are out. If you've had tubular or any other types of adenomas, you'll need to have a follow-up colonoscopy to make sure they don't return. Usually, you'll need a repeat procedure every 3-5 years. But you may need one sooner if you had a lot of polyps, if they were big, or if your doctor was not able to remove them all. If you have a history of polyps in your colon, you're more likely to get colon cancer. Screening is your best way to prevent that. Doctors generally recommend getting your first colonoscopy at age 50. You may need to start at age 40 or earlier if someone in your family has had serious polyps or colon cancer. You also can take these steps to help avoid both colon polyps and colon cancer: Eat less fat and more vegetables, fresh fruits, and other high-fiber foods Keep your weight in a healthy range Avoid smoking and too much alcohol Talk to your doctors about pros and cons of taking an aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (such as ibuprofen) regularly. It may help protect again colon cancer"
399,"You can do many things to help knee pain, whether it's due to a recent injury or arthritis you've had for years. Follow these 11 dos and don'ts to help your knees feel their best. Don't rest too much. Too much rest can weaken your muscles, which can worsen joint pain. Find an exercise program that is safe for your knees and stick with it. If you're not sure which motions are safe or how much you can do, talk with your doctor or a physical therapist. Do exercise. Cardio exercises strengthen the muscles that support your knee and increase flexibility. Weight training and stretching do, too. For cardio, some good choices include walking, swimming, water aerobics, stationary cycling, and elliptical machines. Tai chi may also help ease stiffness and improve balance. Don't risk a fall. A painful or unstable knee can make a fall more likely, which can cause more knee damage. Curb your risk of falling by making sure your home is well lit, using handrails on staircases, and using a sturdy ladder or foot stool if you need to reach something from a high shelf. Do use "" RICE."" Rest, ice, compression, and elevation ( RICE) is good for knee pain caused by a minor injury or an arthritis flare. Give your knee some rest, apply ice to reduce swelling, wear a compressive bandage, and keep your knee elevated. Don't overlook your weight. If you're overweight, losing weight reduces the stress on your knee. You don't even need to get to your ""ideal"" weight. Smaller changes still make a difference. Don't be shy about using a walking aid. A crutch or cane can take the stress off of your knee. Knee splints and braces can also help you stay stable. Do consider acupuncture. This form of traditional Chinese medicine, which involves inserting fine needles at certain points on the body, is widely used to relieve many types of pain and may help knee pain. Don't let your shoes make matters worse. Cushioned insoles can reduce stress on your knees. For knee osteoarthritis, doctors often recommend special insoles that you put in your shoe. To find the appropriate insole, speak with your doctor or a physical therapist. Do play with temperature. For the first 48 to 72 hours after a knee injury, use a cold pack to ease swelling and numb the pain. A plastic bag of ice or frozen peas works well. Use it for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day. Wrap your ice pack in a towel to be kind to your skin. After that, you can heat things up with a warm bath, heating pad, or warm towel for 15 to 20 minutes, three or four times a day. Don't jar your joint(s). High-impact exercises can further injure painful knees. Avoid jarring exercises such as running, jumping, and kickboxing. Also avoid doing exercises such as lunges and deep squats that put a lot of stress on your knees. These can worsen pain and, if not done correctly, cause injury. Do get expert advice. If your knee pain is new, get a doctor to check it out. It's best to know what you're dealing with ASAP so you can prevent any more damage."
400,"For thousands of years, leaves from the Ginkgo biloba tree have been a common treatment in Chinese medicine. In the U. S., many take ginkgo supplements in the belief that they will improve memory and sharpen thinking. Ginkgo improves blood flow to the brain and acts as an antioxidant. These effects may translate into some benefits for certain medical problems, but the results have been mixed. Some studies have found that in healthy people, ginkgo might modestly boost memory and cognitive speed. Other studies have not found a benefit. Several ginkgo studies have shown that it can help with memory problems caused by dementia or Alzheimer's disease. It seems to help prevent the progression of dementia symptoms, especially if the dementia is thought to be the result of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It does not seem to prevent dementia or Alzheimer's, however. There's good evidence that ginkgo might ease leg pain caused by clogged arteries. It might also help with some other circulation problems. In addition, ginkgo may relieve PMS symptoms, like breast tenderness and mood changes. Researchers have studied ginkgo for many other conditions, including ADHD, depression and other psychological conditions, multiple sclerosis, and tinnitus from a vascular origin. Some people are also using ginkgo to prevent high altitude sickness, though studies have not yet established that it's effective for that. Many uses of ginkgo show promise, but more research needs to be done. There is no standard dose of ginkgo biloba supplements. However, in medical studies, almost all clinical trials have used a standardized extract of ginkgo, standardized to 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones. A common dose in people with dementia is 40 milligrams of that extract three times daily. For improving cognitive function in healthy people, studies have used between 120 milligrams to 600 milligrams of the extract daily. The only source of ginkgo is the ginkgo tree. Most ginkgo supplements are derived from the leaves. Ginkgo seeds can be dangerous, especially when raw. Side effects. Ginkgo leaf supplements are generally safe. In some people, they can cause headache, dizziness, heart palpitations, nausea, gas, and diarrhea. Allergies to ginkgo can trigger rashes or more serious effects. Risks. If you have a bleeding disorder, or are planning surgery, talk to your doctor before using ginkgo. Don't take ginkgo if you have any medical conditions -- especially diabetes, epilepsy, or fertility problems -- unless your doctor recommends it. Do not eat untreated parts of the ginkgo plant. Uncooked ginkgo seeds can cause seizures and death. Interactions. If you take any medicines or supplements regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using ginkgo supplements. They could interact with blood thinners, aspirin, NSAID painkillers, anti-platelet drugs, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, diabetes medicines, drugs that affect the liver and supplements like garlic, saw palmetto, St. Johns wort, and yohimbe. Ginkgo might reduce the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT.) Given the potential risks, ginkgo is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
401,"If you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), you may feel like the deck's stacked against you when it comes to conflict. That's because ADHD can: Make it hard to pay focus or pay attention. You might zone out during conversations or arguments, and the person you're speaking with might feel like you're ignoring them. They may even feel like you don't really care about them. Cause you to be unmotivated or make it hard for you to finish tasks. Other people may misinterpret this as laziness or a sign that you don't care. ADHD can also: Make you more irritable or prone to arguing Raise the chances that you're late, don't follow through on things, or forget important events, like birthdays Make emotional outbursts more likely Lead to impulsive behavior, like drinking too much or overspending All these things can bring on disagreements. But having ADHD doesn't mean you can't have good, healthy relationships with people close to you. You can manage conflict and ease stress. Follow these steps: It eases symptoms. That can help you avoid confrontations and make it easier to deal with problems as they come up. Most of the time, ADHD is treated with cognitive behavioral therapy. That's a form of talk therapy that helps you identify or change negative thoughts. Medicine can also help. Many folks find a combination of both works best. If you often have trouble dealing with others, think about seeing a therapist or ADHD coach. They can do role-playing exercises with you to teach you new ways to communicate. They can also teach you skills to help you work through difficult conversations and situations. When you're about to have a tough talk or feel like an argument may crop up, think about what you want to accomplish before you speak. You can even try to visualize how you'd like to act before you see the other person. This can help you keep your cool in a heated situation. Simple steps can make any conversation easier. Make sure you: Are face-to-face with the other person when you're talking to them Listen carefully when they're speaking Don't interrupt Ask questions when you don't understand something Let the other person know you understand them by using phrases like â It sounds like you're saying,â or â Tell me if I'm hearing you right ...â You might feel like the people closest to you are constantly criticizing or nagging you. Odds are, they just want to help and see you do your best. Try to keep in mind where they're coming from. If it's tough for you to follow through, and it's a regular source of conflict, work with your loved ones to come up with a âget it doneâ plan. For example, you might ask your spouse to let you know about an important birthday the day before it happens. Or you could decide when it's OK for someone to remind you about something. Knowing when to expect a reminder can make it feel less like nagging and more like help. That can hold off a fight. If you feel like you're losing your cool or a conversation isn't going the right way, take a break. It's OK to ask for a breather if you feel unfocused. You can resume your discussion later when you feel calm and ready to talk things through."
402,"The exact causes of bipolar disorder are unknown. While genes and life stress may contribute to it, experts believe that symptoms may arise from a problem with nerve circuits and areas in the brain that control emotion, thinking, and behavior. The best treatment for bipolar disorder is often a combination of medication and counseling. Other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) are often successful for people with very severe symptoms who don't respond to traditional therapy or who can't take the medications. Doctors sometimes treat the mania symptoms of bipolar disorder with one set of drugs and the depression symptoms with another, although some mood-stabilizing drugs are effective at treating both kinds of symptoms. Certain drugs are also used for ""maintenance"" to maintain a steady mood. Antidepressants are usually not used alone because they sometimes cause manic attacks in depressed patients, and they may be less effective for treating bipolar than unipolar depression. Many people respond well to medications for bipolar disorder. For many others, the symptoms do not completely disappear despite therapy. The mood symptoms may become less intense and more manageable, however. Remember, getting your diagnosis should come as a relief. Now you know what the problem has been and you're on the road to getting the right treatment. If you are suffering from bipolar mania, your doctor at first may treat you with an anti-manic mood stabilizer and sometimes also an antipsychotic drug and/or a benzodiazepine to quickly control hyperactivity, sleeplessness, hostility, and irritability. Mood stabilizers treat manias or depressions without causing symptoms to swing the other way. Some also may help to reduce the risk of suicide. They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Examples include lithium and certain anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal) or valproate ( Depakote). Atypical antipsychotics used to treat mania include aripiprazole ( Abilify), asenapine ( Saphris), cariprazine ( Vryalar), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), risperidone ( Risperdal), and ziprasidone ( Geodon) . Treating bipolar mania often requires hospitalization because there is high risk for unpredictable, reckless behavior and noncompliance with treatment. For people with extreme mania, pregnant women with mania, or those people whose mania can't be controlled with mood stabilizers, doctors sometimes also recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania. Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone. Treating bipolar depression is controversial and challenging. Studies have shown that antidepressants may be less effective in treating bipolar depression than they are in treating unipolar depression (that is, major depressive episodes in someone who has never had a previous manic or hypomanic episode). Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Antidepressants alone also may lead to or prolong rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, a person may recover more quickly from depression but then experience mania followed by another episode of depression. And antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and adolescents with any form of depression. Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias. If psychotic symptoms occur during an acute depressive episode, the doctor may recommend antipsychotic medicine. Nondrug treatments -- such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine -- may help patients in their maintenance phase. They are often suggested along with medication. Psychotherapy alone is typically not enough to treat bipolar depression unless symptoms are mild."
403," Your health care provider may send you for cholesterol tests, either as a part of a standard check-up or because he or she suspects you may be at risk for developing heart disease. But do you know what the cholesterol test results actually mean? Read on to learn how to interpret the numbers. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you take in more cholesterol from certain foods, such as those from animals. If you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up in the walls of your arteries (as ""plaque"") and eventually harden. This process, called atherosclerosis, actually narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to travel through the vessels. Unfortunately, high cholesterol doesn't cause symptoms. In later stages of atherosclerosis, though, you may suffer angina -- severe chest pain from lack of blood flow to the heart. If an artery gets totally blocked, a heart attack results. A routine blood cholesterol test is a far better way of finding out what your cholesterol level is. In addition to measuring the total cholesterol in your blood, the standard cholesterol test (called a ""lipid panel"") measures three specific kinds of fat: Low-density lipoproteins ( LDL). This is the ""bad cholesterol,"" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. In general, the lower the number, the better. But LDL cholesterol is only one part of a larger equation that measures a person's overall risk of having a heart attack or stroke. For years, guidelines focused on specific target numbers for individuals to achieve to lower their risk. The most recent guidelines focus on a person's overall risk and, based on that risk, recommend a certain percentage of LDL reduction as one part of a strategy for preventing serious heart and vascular problems. High-density lipoproteins ( HDL). This is the ""good cholesterol."" It transports bad cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it is excreted by the body. Your HDL is another part of the equation that identifies the risk of a cardiovascular event. In general, the higher the number the better, although, as with LDL, the emphasis has shifted from specific target numbers to strategies for reducing the overall risk. Triglycerides. Another type of fat in the bloodstream, triglycerides are also linked to heart disease. They are stored in fat cells throughout the body. If you have a lipoprotein profile, it's important to look at all the numbers from the cholesterol test, not just the total cholesterol number. That's because LDL and HDL levels are two primary indicators of potential heart disease. Use the information below to interpret your results (with the help of your doctor, of course). This will help you get a better idea about your risk for heart disease. Total blood cholesterol level: High risk: 240 mg/d L and above Borderline high risk: 200-239 mg/d L Desirable: Less than 200 mg/d L LDL cholesterol levels: 190 mg/d L and above represents a high risk for heart disease and is a strong indicator that the individual can benefit from intensive treatment, including life style changes, diet, and statin therapy for reducing that risk. For LDL levels that are equal to or less than 189 mg/d L, the guidelines recommend strategies for lowering LDL by 30% to 50% depending on what other risk factors you have that can affect the health of your heart and blood vessels. HDL cholesterol: High risk: Less than 40 mg/d L for men and less than 50 mg/d L for women Triglycerides: Very high risk: 500 mg/d L and above High risk: 200-499 mg/d L Borderline high risk: 150-199 mg/d L Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L If your doctor recommends a ""non-fasting"" cholesterol test, the lab will look only at your total cholesterol (and sometimes your HDL) numbers. For that test, you merely need to show up at the lab and have some blood drawn. If your doctor suggests a ""fasting"" cholesterol test (also called a ""lipid profile""), the lab will analyze your levels of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. For that test, you will need to fast nine to 12 hours before the blood test. Sometimes a doctor will ask you to do a non-fasting cholesterol test first. Depending on the results, he or she may then send you back for the more complete lipid profile. After reviewing your blood test, The doctor will also consider other risk factors you might have for heart disease, including: Your family history Age Weight Race Gender Diet Blood pressure and whether or not you're being treated for high blood pressure Activity level Smoking status History of diabetes Evidence of elevated blood sugars Then, your doctor will talk with you about your level of risk and the potential benefit to be derived by taking steps that include changes in your level of activity and diet as well as using medication to improve your cholesterol levels in order to reduce your overall risk. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends adults age 20 years or older have a cholesterol test every five years. People who are at risk for heart attack or heart disease or who have a family history of either should be checked more often."
404,"Although anyone can get rheumatoid arthritis, women with RA outnumber men by about three to one. Many women with rheumatoid arthritis are diagnosed in their 20s and 30s, just when marriage and family start to take life's center stage. With pain, fatigue, and medication side effects to consider, there's no question rheumatoid arthritis makes family planning more complicated. But RA doesn't have to put your dreams of having a family out of reach. If you're thinking about starting a family while living with rheumatoid arthritis, consider these tips. Rheumatoid arthritis itself doesn't seem to harm the developing baby, even if RA is active during pregnancy. In fact, 70% to 80% of women with RA have improvement of their symptoms during pregnancy. Although some women with RA may have a slight risk of miscarriage or low-birth-weight babies, the vast majority of women have normal pregnancies without complications. However, many drugs for rheumatoid arthritis -- including methotrexate ( Otrexup, Rheumatrex, Trexall) and leflunomide ( Arava) -- can cause birth defects. These same medications may also cause birth defects if they are taken by men who father children. Therefore, it's important to talk to your doctor about altering treatment several months before you or your spouse try to get pregnant. With the right treatment and prenatal care, babies born to moms with rheumatoid arthritis are as healthy and happy as any. Experts disagree whether rheumatoid arthritis reduces fertility in women or men. It's true that many women with RA take longer to conceive than women without rheumatoid arthritis. Inconsistent ovulation, decreased sex drive, or having sex less often due to pain and fatigue are possible explanations. For men, acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis temporarily reduce sperm count and function, and can cause erection problems and decreased libido. For both men and women, effective treatment for RA improves sexual symptoms and function. In well-treated rheumatoid arthritis, fertility in most men and women is probably normal. New biologic drugs for RA have created a new era of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, according to rheumatologists. With early and aggressive treatment, most people with RA can avoid joint deformities and major disability. For most women, that means being present and active throughout your children's years at home. While bad days from RA symptoms may be unavoidable, doctors believe most women will keep their independence for decades, and possibly their lifetimes. As soon as you're considering starting a family, see your rheumatologist. Some drugs need a months-long ""washout"" period before trying to conceive. And that goes for men as well as women; although unproven, methotrexate might result in sperm problems that could cause birth defects. If you're taking leflunomide for RA, even more advance planning is necessary. Due to its long half-life, leflunomide needs to be stopped two years before trying to conceive a baby, although there are ways to ""wash"" it out of your system quicker. Your rheumatologist will help you decide on a treatment plan that includes both control of your RA symptoms and safety for your baby. Low-dose prednisone, forexample, is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine are also considered safe. While evidence is limited for biologic medicines like etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi), infliximab ( Remicade), and infliximab-abda ( Renflexis) or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), biosimilars, many rheumatologists are confident in their relative safety during pregnancy. One way to avoid the risk of pregnancy problems from RA medications is to simply not take any. Under a doctor's supervision, some women quit RA drugs ""cold turkey"" when they begin trying to conceive. This method has its own risk, of course: possible progression of joint damage from flares during the time when you are off treatment. In certain women, though, some rheumatologists endorse the approach, with close monitoring for disease activity. Interestingly, pregnancy usually has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, albeit temporary. About 70% to 80% of women experience improvement in their RA symptoms during pregnancy. In many of these women, drugs for RA may be safely reduced or even eliminated during pregnancy. For about one-quarter of women, though, rheumatoid arthritis activity continues during pregnancy, or gets worse. Unfortunately, the respite from RA symptoms during pregnancy is short-lived. Most women relapse after delivering their babies. Again, remembering the potentially harmful effects of some rheumatoid arthritis drugs on the fetus, it's essential to avoid pregnancy until you're ready. Experts say that used properly, a variety of methods are appropriateand effective, such as: Condoms Oral contraceptives Vaginal ring Intrauterine device ( IUD) Although controversial studies have suggested oral contraceptives might prevent rheumatoid arthritis in some women, there is no evidence that they help control RA symptoms."
405,""" Congenital heart defect"" is another way of saying your heart had a problem when you were born. You may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be very serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems during pregnancy. You might not get symptoms until adulthood, or you may not get any at all. Doctors don't always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families. Things that make them more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome Taking certain medications, or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy A viral infection, like rubella ( German measles) in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. For instance: Heart valve defects: One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can't get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart's ""walls"": It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn't. Issues with the heart's muscle: These can lead to heart failure, which means the heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels: In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. It's possible for you to have a heart-related birth defect and not have symptoms. If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure. You might not need any treatment. Or you may need medications, surgery, or other procedures. If you have congenital heart disease, you'll need to see a heart specialist on a regular basis. People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (a condition doctors call endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist. Take antibiotics before you have any medical work that may cause bleeding, like dental work and most surgeries. Check with your doctor about the type and amount of antibiotics that you should take."
406,"Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens your bones, making fractures more likely. It's most common later in life, especially in women after menopause. But it's possible for children and teens to develop juvenile osteoporosis. This most often happens in children between ages 8 and 14. It sometimes develops in younger children during growth spurts. It's a serious problem, because it strikes when a child is still building up his bone strength. You build about 90% of your bone mass by the time you're 18 to 20. Losing bone mass during prime bone-building years can put someone at risk for complications such as fractures. There are two kinds of juvenile osteoporosis: secondary and idiopathic. Secondary osteoporosis means that another medical condition is to blame. This is by far the most common kind of juvenile osteoporosis. Some of the diseases and causes that can lead to osteoporosis in children include: Juvenile arthritis Diabetes Cystic fibrosis Leukemia Celiac disease Osteogenesis imperfecta (""brittle bone disease"") Homocystinuria (a genetic metabolic disorder) Hyperthyroidism Hyperparathyroidism Cushing's syndrome Malabsorption syndromes Anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders Kidney disease Sometimes, juvenile osteoporosis is a direct result of disease itself. For example, with rheumatoid arthritis, children may have lower than expected bone mass, especially near arthritic joints. The so-called female athlete triad can also lead to osteoporosis in young women. It's a syndrome of three conditions that include lack of energy caused by poor eating habits and missed periods. Certain drugs can also lead to juvenile osteoporosis. These can include chemotherapy for cancer, anticonvulsant medicines for seizures, or steroids for arthritis. If your child has one of these conditions, talk to his doctor about checking on his bone density. Idiopathic osteoporosis means that doctors don't know what caused the disease. This type of juvenile osteoporosis is much less common. It seems to be more common in boys than in girls. It usually starts just before puberty. The child's bone density may mostly recover during puberty, but still not quite be normal when bone mass peaks as an adult. The signs and symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis include: Pain in the lower back, hips, knees, ankles, and feet Trouble with walking Fractures in the legs, ankles, or feet Juvenile osteoporosis is hard to define. Bone density scans are the most accurate way to detect lowered bone mass early on, but they need to be interpreted carefully to make a clear diagnosis in children. Instead, doctors usually diagnose juvenile when there are signs that a child has a fragile skeleton. This might show up when a child's bone breaks without something like a bad fall or other trauma, and the child has a low bone mineral density score. Your child's doctor will make recommendations based on the cause of your child's juvenile osteoporosis. If another disease is to blame, she'll treat it. If a medication is responsible, your child may be able to take a different medicine or a lower dose. None of the osteoporosis drugs that adults can take are approved for use in children. It's very important to protect your child's bones from fracture. He may need to use crutches or other supports. He may also need to avoid types of exercise, such as contact sports, that could cause a fracture. Your doctor can tell you what's OK. All children, including those with juvenile osteoporosis, need a lifestyle that helps build healthy bones. This includes a diet rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, and as much safe physical activity as possible. It's best to avoid caffeine. Many experts also suggest that children with juvenile osteoporosis get bone density tests at least every other year into adulthood."
407,"Millions of children in America with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) have been helped in school, activities, and home life by taking medications. But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics. At high doses, it may make some people more likely to have seizures and can cause hallucinations."
408," A coccyx injury results in pain and discomfort in the tailbone area (the condition is called coccydynia). These injuries may result in a bruise, dislocation, or fracture (break) of the coccyx. Although they may be slow to heal, the majority of coccyx injuries can be managed with cautious treatment. The coccyx is the triangular bony structure located at the bottom of the vertebral column. It is composed of three to five bony segments held in place by joints and ligaments. The majority of coccyx injuries occur in women, because the female pelvis is broader and the coccyx is more exposed. Most tailbone injuries are caused by trauma to the coccyx area. A fall onto the tailbone in the seated position, usually against a hard surface, is the most common cause of coccyx injuries. A direct blow to the tailbone, such as those that occur during contact sports, can injure the coccyx. The coccyx can be injured or fractured during childbirth. Repetitive straining or friction against the coccyx (as happens in bicycling or rowing) can injure the coccyx. Sometimes, the cause of coccyx injuries is unknown. Less common causes of coccyx injuries include bone spurs, compression of nerve roots, injuries to other parts of the spine, local infections, and tumors. Severe localized pain and tenderness may be felt in the tailbone area. If the injury is traumatic, a bruise may be visible in this area. The pain is generally worse when sitting for prolonged periods of time, or with direct pressure to the tailbone area. Bowel movements and straining are often painful. Some women may experience pain during sexual intercourse. If you have the signs and symptoms of a coccyx injury or unexplained discomfort in the tailbone area, contact your doctor. It may be necessary for the doctor to decide if the injury is traumatic or if the pain is caused by other, more serious, problems. Injuries to the region of the tailbone rarely require a visit to the emergency department. However, if you are concerned about your symptoms, it is wise to call a doctor or visit the nearest hospital's emergency department. The cause of a coccyx injury is largely determined based on a medical history and a physical exam. Occasionally, X-rays are taken. The entire vertebral column (spine) may be examined. A neurologic exam may be performed. A rectal exam may also be performed. For this exam, the doctor inserts a finger into your rectum to feel the area of the coccyx and determine if there is a dislocation or a fracture that can be felt and if direct pressure against the coccyx reproduces your pain. Rarely, if the cause of discomfort is unknown, a local anesthetic may be injected into the tailbone area to determine whether the origin of the pain is from the coccyx or another part of the vertebral column. X-rays may be taken to determine whether there is a fracture or dislocation. However, X-rays occasionally may not reveal these injuries. Some doctors recommend X-rays in both the standing and seated positions to better determine the presence of a fracture or dislocation. Tailbone injuries are often extremely painful, so home remedies aim to control pain and avoid further irritation to the area. Avoid sitting down for long periods of time. When seated, avoid sitting on hard surfaces and alternate sitting on each side of the buttocks. Also, lean forward and direct your weight away from the tailbone. For traumatic injuries, apply ice to the tailbone area for 15-20 minutes, four times a day, for the first few days after the injury. Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen to reduce pain and improve your ability to move around. Do not take NSAIDS if you have kidney disease, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, or are also taking a blood thinner -- such as Coumadin -- without first talking with your doctor. In that case, it is safer to take acetaminophen, which helps lessen pain but does not reduce inflammation. You can purchase a ""doughnut"" cushion or pillow to sit on. This cushion has a hole in the middle to prevent the tailbone from contacting the flat surface. Eat foods high in fiber to soften stools and avoid constipation. In addition to home care, a doctor may be able to provide further relief of pain with other medical and, rarely, surgical interventions. Stronger pain medications may be prescribed at the discretion of your doctor. Stool softeners may be prescribed to prevent constipation. Injections of local anesthetics into the tailbone are sometimes required for continuing pain. Rarely, the coccyx may be surgically removed. Follow-up is recommended at the discretion of your doctor and depends on the severity of the injury and the progress you are making with medical treatment. Most people do not require follow-up if their coccyx injury is improving with medical treatment. People with chronic tailbone pain, for whom medical therapy has not worked, require more frequent follow-up and may be referred to other medical or surgical specialists. Most tailbone injuries are accidental (such as a slip on ice) and therefore cannot be entirely avoided. Wear proper protective padding when participating in contact sports that can potentially lead to coccyx injuries. The prognosis for tailbone discomfort depends on many factors. The original cause of the problem (whether from a fall or other trauma, tumor, or infection) If traumatic, the severity of the injury (a bruise, fracture, or dislocation) Your ability to comply with medical treatment Your natural ability to recuperate and heal The majority of cases of traumatic coccyx injury get better within several weeks of the injury with proper medical treatment. A few people suffer from chronic discomfort despite proper medical treatment. This can be an extremely frustrating and debilitating problem."
409,"In about 46,000 people per year in the U. S., pancreatic cancer will arise, grow, and spread, often before it's ever discovered. As with many types of cancer, the causes of pancreatic cancer are mysterious. Although certain risk factors have been identified, the story is far from complete. Pancreatic cancer develops when a cell in the pancreas acquires damage to its DNA that causes it to behave and multiply abnormally. A single cancer cell grows and divides rapidly, becoming a tumor that does not respect normal boundaries in the body. Eventually, cells from the tumor travel elsewhere in the body (metastasize) through the blood or lymphatic system. No one knows exactly how the process of DNA damage leading to pancreatic cancer occurs. Analyzing pancreatic cancers removed by surgery shows certain mutations that occur in nearly all cases, and others that vary between people. Some of these mutations occur randomly. Others occur in response to things we do or experience in the environment. Some mutations may be inherited. When enough mutations accumulate, a cell becomes malignant and a tumor begins to grow. No one understands the underlying causes of pancreatic cancer, but certain risk factors have been identified. These factors are present more often in people who get pancreatic cancer than in people who don't. There are multiple pancreatic risk factors, although most are only weakly associated with the disease. Many people with pancreatic cancer don't have any one specific risk factor. About one in 76 people will develop pancreatic cancer. This represents the average risk of the condition. People with any of the risk factors are at slightly higher risk than the general population: Genetics. Five percent to 10% of people with pancreatic cancer have an immediate family member who also had it. Several different genes have been associated with the increased risk, although no ""pancreatic cancer gene"" has yet been identified. Diabetes. People with diabetes are not necessarily more likely to get pancreatic cancer but the two have been linked. Smoking. Cigarette smoking is well known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. The more a person smokes, the higher the risk. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk returns to about that of someone who never smoked. Obesity and inactivity. In a study of 88,000 nurses, those who were obese (body mass index higher than 30) were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Those who exercised frequently were about half as likely to get pancreatic cancer, compared to those who did not exercise at all. Pancreatic cysts and chronic pancreatitis. People who have one or both of these are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Diet. A diet high in fat and meat (especially smoked or processed meat) has been linked to pancreatic cancer in animal studies. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables decreased pancreatic cancer risk in other studies. Still other studies suggest there's no identifiable link between diet and pancreatic cancer. Lycopene and selenium. Studies have shown low levels of these nutrients in some people who developed pancreatic cancer. That's not proof that low levels of lycopene and selenium cause pancreatic cancer, though. Any diet that includes lean meat and red or yellow vegetables should provide adequate lycopene and selenium. Eliminating your risk factors for pancreatic cancer won't reduce your risk entirely. But eating a healthy diet, keeping a healthy weight, and exercising frequently will improve overall health, and reduce your risk of other health problems."
410,"Everyone gets headaches from time to time. And most of us have caffeine in what we drink and eat every day. Have you considered whether there's a connection? It's possible for caffeine to both cause and cure a headache. When your head hurts, you want relief fast. Whether it's a run-of-the-mill tension headache or a migraine, caffeine can help. That's why it's an ingredient in a lot of popular pain relievers. It can make them as much as 40% more effective. Sometimes you can stop the pain in its tracks just by having caffeine alone. Caffeine helps reduce inflammation, and that can bring relief. It also gives a boost to common headache remedies. Whether you use aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, they work faster and better and keep the pain away for longer when combined with caffeine. A very rare condition called hypnic headaches responds especially well to caffeine. These strike older people, waking them in the middle of the night with severe pain. Doctors typically tell people who get these to have a cup of coffee before bed. Oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches. Since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain. Withdrawal: It's easy for your body to get so used to the effects of caffeine that when you don't have it in your system, you have withdrawal. A headache is one of the symptoms. This can happen when you have caffeine regularly, even as little as a cup of coffee a day. Too Much Medication: Caffeine can also a factor in what's known as a medication overuse, or rebound headache. This can happen when you take too much of any kind of pain reliever or take it too often. When the medicine wears off, the pain comes back worse than before. When you combine caffeine with pain relievers this condition is more likely. Be aware of how caffeine affects you, and pay attention to how much of it you drink and eat. If you get migraines, or if you find yourself having headaches frequently, you may want to try to cut down on caffeine or avoid it completely. It's best to do that gradually. For example, if you normally have 2 cups of coffee in the morning, start by cutting back to one. If you quit suddenly, it can take up to a week to get past the withdrawal symptoms. Keep track of your headaches and what seems to help. Get good sleep, and drink plenty of water. A nutritious diet and daily exercise can also help. Try to manage stress. You might be able to beat a headache with relaxation techniques, meditation, or massage instead of using medicine or caffeine."
411,"Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or legs -- especially on just one side of the body Slurred or unusual speech Trouble seeing in one or both eyes Trouble walking, dizziness, or balance problems Sudden confusion Severe headache Tell emergency personnel the exact time when you first noticed symptoms. Depending on the type of stroke, there is a medicine that may reduce long-term effects if given within four and a half hours of when the first symptom appearing. The sooner is better. If the person is diabetic, check the blood glucose (sugar) level. Treat low glucose with a glucose tablet, glass of orange juice or other sugary drink or food, or a glucagon injection (if the person is not able to swallow). At the hospital, a doctor will examine the person and run tests to confirm the diagnosis and to see if the stroke was caused by clots or from bleeding in the brain. Tests may include an MRI or a CT scan. Treatment may include medication, lifestyle changes, and possibly surgery."
412," Your 3-month-old is growing bigger and becoming more aware every day. By this age, your baby should be settling into a schedule, and giving you some much-needed rest! This portion of Web MD's month-by-month guide describes a few of the baby milestones you can expect your child to reach at three months. Those innate reflexes -- such as the startle reflex that your baby displayed during the first couple of months -- should be fading or gone by now. You've probably also noticed that baby's neck strength is improving. When you hold him upright, you should see very little or even no head wobbling. Three-month-old babies also should have enough upper-body strength to support their head and chest with their arms while lying on their stomach and enough lower body strength to stretch out their legs and kick. As you watch your baby, you should see some early signs of hand-eye coordination. Your baby's hands can open and shut, come together, swipe at colorful dangling toys, briefly grab a toy or rattle, and go straight into the mouth. Your 3-month-old's nervous system is maturing, and his stomach can accommodate more milk or formula. Those changes should allow your baby to sleep for a stretch of six or seven hours at a time, which translates into a good night's sleep for you. If your baby does wake up in the middle of the night, wait about 30 seconds before heading into the nursery. Sometimes, babies will cry for a few seconds and then go back to sleep. When you rush in at the first sound of fussing, your baby won't learn how to fall back asleep on his own. When the cries don't stop and you do need to go into your baby's room in the middle of the night, stick to the essentials. Feeding and changing should be done in the dark, if possible, and then it's right back into the crib. Eventually, he will get the idea that nighttime is for sleeping only. Your baby's daytime sleep schedule should also become more routine by now. Most 3-month-old babies take a few naps of about 1 1/2 to 2 hours each day. Your 3-month-old's hearing and vision are improving. Babies this age turn their heads and smile at the sound of their parents' voices, and they love listening to all kinds of music. Your baby will still prefer to look at brightly colored toys. That's because sharp contrasts are easier to see. Faces are absolutely fascinating to 3-month-old babies. Look at him and he will stare back into your eyes. Your infant will also gaze intently at his own reflection in a crib mirror. At three months, your baby is becoming more of a unique human being. This is the stage that child psychiatrist Margaret Mahler referred to as ''hatching,'' when babies come out of their ''shells'' and begin to react and relate to the world around them. Part of this hatching process involves interacting with people and smiling for pleasure, otherwise known as social smiles. By the third month, crying is no longer your baby's primary method of communication. In fact, 3-month-old babies should cry for no more than an hour each day. If the crying exceeds this, or seems excessive to you, schedule a visit with your pediatrician, because reflux or another medical problem may be behind the tears. Instead of crying, your baby is starting to communicate in other ways, such as cooing and making vowel sounds (''oh'' and ''ah,'' for example). Engage your little one in conversation by responding to these sounds and narrating what you are doing when you are together. Say, '' I'm going to change your diaper now,'' or, '' It's time for lunch!'' Your baby will listen raptly to the sound of your voice and watch facial expressions as you talk. Eventually, he will start forming his own sounds and making his own gestures. Having conversations is also a great way to bond with your baby. Every baby is a little different. Don't be alarmed if your 3-month-old misses a milestone, especially if he was born prematurely. However, do call your pediatrician if your baby hasn't done the following things by three months: Responded to noises Followed people or objects with his eyes Smiled Reached for objects A number of experts offer advice on parenting, particularly on how to get your baby to sleep through the night. Listen to the advice, but trust your instincts. If letting your baby cry it out (the Ferber method) doesn't work for your baby and it goes against your beliefs as a parent, don't do it. You might hear from a friend or family member that starting your baby on solid foods now will help him sleep through the night. But you need to wait at least one more month. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't recommend that babies eat anything but breast milk or formula until they are between 4 months and 6 months old."
413,"If you or someone you love has thyroid cancer, you want to know what treatments are available and what to expect. This depends on several things â starting with what stage of cancer you have. It's easy to get swamped by the numbers, letters, and unfamiliar words, even when you're not under stress. This article will help you make better sense of what is happening based on the cancer's stage. The thyroid is a gland at the base of your throat. It makes hormones that help your body work properly. There are four main types of thyroid cancer: Papillary (the most common type) Follicular Medullary Anaplastic If your doctor finds cancer, he'll begin the process of staging. He'll run tests to see if it has spread to other parts of your body. The American Joint Committee on Cancer created the system that's most often used to describe the stages of thyroid cancer. It's called the â TNMâ system, and it focuses on these three things: T -- How big is the main tumor, and has it spread to other areas of the body? N -- Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? ( These are bean-shaped cells that help your body fight infection). M -- Has the cancer spread, or metastasized, to other areas of the body or organs, namely the lungs, liver, and bones? After your doctor runs tests to find out what type of thyroid cancer you have, he'll add a number to each letter listed above. The higher the number, the more advanced is that aspect of the cancer. ( For example, T2- T4 means a larger tumor than T1). Next, your doctor will group this information into stages. These are represented by the Roman numerals I through IV. For the most advanced cases, the letters â A,â â Bâ and â Câ also are used to indicate how far the cancer has spread. What type of cancer you have, as well as your age, will have some bearing on your stage. Here's what each stage of thyroid cancer means, grouped by types: Stage I -- The tumor can be any size. It may have spread nearby tissues or nearby lymph nodes. But it hasn't spread to other parts of the body. Stage II -- The tumor is any size. Cancer may have spread to your lymph nodes. It also has spread to other parts of your body, like your lungs or bones. Stage I -- You only have cancer in your thyroid. The tumor is 2 centimeters (about the size of a nickel) or smaller. Stage II -- You only have cancer in your thyroid. The tumor is more than 2 centimeters but less than 4 centimeters. Stage III -- The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters and has spread to tissues near your thyroid, or it's smaller and has reached your nearby lymph nodes. If you are at stage IV, it means the cancer has spread. Your doctor assigns the letters â A,â â Bâ and â Câ to show how far. Stage IVA -- The cancer has spread beyond your thyroid. It now is under your skin, or it affects your larynx, esophagus or trachea. A smaller tumor in more distant lymph nodes is also considered stage IVA. Stage IVB -- The tumor has grown toward your spine or into nearby large blood vessels, like the carotid arteries. These carry blood to your brain, face, and neck. It might have also spread to your lymph nodes. Stage IVC -- The cancer has spread beyond the thyroid, and to distant sites of the body. It may be in your lungs, bones, and lymph nodes. The following things apply to everyone who has this type of cancer, no matter their age. Stage I -- The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. It's only in your thyroid. Stage II -- It's larger than 2 centimeters and found only in your thyroid. Or, it's any size but has spread to tissues beyond your thyroid. It hasn't spread to your lymph nodes. Stage III -- It may be smaller or larger than 2 centimeters and may also be in the tissues beyond your thyroid. The cancer is now in the lymph nodes near your voice box and windpipe. Stage IV -- As with follicular and papillary thyroid cancer, stage IV means that the cancer has spread to distant sites in your body, and the letters â A,â â B,â and â Câ indicate where it has gone. This is a fast-growing type of thyroid cancer. For this reason, it's described only as stage IVA, IVB, or IVC. By the time your doctor finds it, it may have already spread to your neck. Here's what each stage means: Stage IVA -- Cancer is in your thyroid. It may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage IV -- It has spread beyond your thyroid. It may be in your lymph nodes. Stage IVC -- It has spread to other areas of your body such as your lungs and bones. It may also be in your lymph nodes."
414,"Foods rarely trigger an asthma attack. But the symptoms of a severe allergic reaction to some foods can mimic asthma symptoms. The first step is to know if you have a food allergy. Any abnormal reaction to a food is considered an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions can either be: Food allergy: When your immune system reacts to proteins in foods that usually are safe or harmless. Your doctor can do skin tests to find out if you're sensitive to certain foods. Food intolerance: When your body responds to the food, not your immune system. Examples include food poisoning, reactions to chemicals in food or drinks such as caffeine, or reflux. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Tree nuts Food preservatives can also trigger an asthma attack. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and can be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods For most people, the usual symptoms of food allergies are hives, rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you have food allergies that trigger symptoms of an asthma attack, you will likely have these allergy symptoms, followed by coughing and wheezing. And if not caught quickly, anaphylaxis -- swelling of the throat, cutting off your airway -- may result. If you suspect certain foods are asthma triggers for you, talk to your doctor. She can give you allergy skin tests to find out if you're allergic to these foods. There are simple ways to say safe: Avoid the food trigger. Try not to come into contact with the food you're allergic to. Always read labels and ask how foods are prepared when you eat out. Consider allergy shots. They can train your immune system to not overreact. The doctors will give you allergy shots (immunotherapy) -- a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy. After repeated shots over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction. Ask your doctor if you're a candidate for allergy shots. Sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT) is an alternative to allergy shots. You let the medicine dissolve under your tongue instead of getting a shot. Keep epinephrine with you. If your allergies are severe, you should keep two epinephrine shot kits with you that are always easy to get to. If you have any sign of anaphylaxis, don't hesitate to use the epinephrine auto-injector, even if you aren't sure your symptoms are allergy-related. Using the auto-injector as a precaution won't hurt you and might save you. Dial 911 after you give yourself the shot. Children who have both asthma and food allergies are more likely to have both near-fatal or fatal allergic reactions to food and severe asthma, particularly if the asthma isn't well-controlled. Food allergies can make persistent asthma more likely in young children."
415,"If you've ever owned or spent time with a friendly dog, you probably know puppy love can calm anxiety and lift your mood. That's why you often see canines at cancer centers. Therapy dogs can bring comfort to people being treated for cancer, and they may help them get better, too. What are therapy dogs? They're specially trained animals who visit with adults and children in the hospital to help them feel better both emotionally and physically. Most of these dogs live at home with their owners and make routine visits to cancer facilities. The visits usually last less than 2 hours, and the animals typically stay with each person for about 15 or 20 minutes. Dogs can go to rooms, treatment areas like chemotherapy suites, and lounges or group areas. Sessions look a lot like play. A visit can involve hugging, petting, or talking to the dog. Some people read to the pup, play with it, or even walk it. Therapy dogs come in all shapes, sizes, and breeds, including golden retrievers, poodles, dachshunds, pugs, and German shepherds. But certain canines match up better with specific people. For example, an active child may do better with an active dog who likes to play and can fetch a ball. If you're not feeling well or are in pain, a calm dog who can lie on the bed with you may be a better choice. What are the benefits? Cancer diagnoses and treatments are stressful. Studies show that spending time with a therapy dog lowers blood pressure and levels of the ""stress hormone"" cortisol. At the same time, it boosts levels of feel-good hormones. Therapy dogs may help lessen pain, too. They might trigger the release of endorphins, which ease discomfort. They can help with physical therapy, too. When you pet a dog, that can help improve your sensory and fine motor skills. A canine may even help you with the all-important first step: getting out of bed. Walking with a dog on a leash and playing games with it can help your balance and coordination. What should I know? A therapy dog should be trained, insured, and registered by a formal animal-assisted therapy program. The dog must also: Be at least 1 year old Have lived in its owner's home for at least 6 months Be house trained Enjoy spending time with people, not just put up with it Have no history of biting or aggression Be able to walk on a leash (they're required to) Know basic commands such as ""sit,"" ""down,"" ""stay,"" ""come,"" and ""leave it."" Therapy dogs may also know "" Go say hello"" and "" Paws up,"" which directs them to stand with their two front feet on a stool so you can reach them for petting if you're in bed. It's up to you if you'd like a visit. If you don't like dogs, are allergic to them, or have a higher risk of infection because of chemotherapy, you probably should skip it. If your immune system is suppressed, make sure you get an OK from your doctor before spending time with any animal. Are there risks? You can rest assured that any therapy dog will be gentle and friendly. In order to become one, a canine needs to have the right temperament. If they don't, they won't be certified. The dogs are screened regularly by a vet and kept current on all their shots, including rabies. It's possible for a dog to pass on diseases to people or injure them. But such things rarely, if ever, happen with trained, registered therapy dogs. Cleanliness is always top of mind. Handlers are required to carry (and use) an alcohol-based sanitizer at all times. Anyone who comes in contact with the dog should wash their hands before and afterward. The dogs are usually bathed the day before a therapy session and brushed right before seeing patients. The therapy vest many of the animals wear helps catch loose hair. Dogs that get on beds sit on a protective cover like a sheet. The animals shouldn't come in contact with wounds or equipment, and they aren't allowed to visit patients who are eating or drinking. How do I arrange a visit? Dozens of therapy dog organizations across America offer visits. Most service a local area, but some will bring a pup wherever you are. Some therapy dogs make regularly scheduled visits to facilities, say once or twice a week. If you're just not up for it when the dog comes, you can reschedule for next time. Check with your hospital liaison to get help setting one up."
416,"Here are answers to your frequently asked questions about hypertension, commonly called high blood pressure. While the cause of high blood pressure in most people remains unclear, inactivity, poor diet, obesity, older age, and genetics -- can all contribute to the development of hypertension. The blood pressure reading is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is written as systolic pressure, the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats, over diastolic pressure, the blood pressure between heartbeats. For example, a blood pressure reading is written as 120/80 mm Hg, or ""120 over 80"". The systolic pressure is 120 and the diastolic pressure is 80. The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has classified blood pressure measurements into several categories: Normal blood pressure is systolic pressure less than 120 and diastolic pressure less than 80 mm Hg. Elevated is systolic pressure of 120-129 and diastolic pressure less than 80 mm Hg. Stage 1 Hypertension is systolic pressure of 130-139 or diastolic pressure of 80-89 mm Hg. Stage 2 Hypertension is systolic pressure of 140 or greater ordiastolic pressure of 90 or greater. Several potentially serious health conditions are linked to high blood pressure, including: Atherosclerosis: a disease of the arteries caused by a buildup of plaque, or fatty material, on the inside walls of the blood vessels; hypertension contributes to this buildup by putting added stress and force on the artery walls. Heart Disease: Heart failure (the heart is not strong enough to pump blood adequately), ischemic heart disease (the heart tissue doesn't get enough blood and oxygen), and hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickened, abnormally functioning heart muscle) are all associated with high blood pressure. Kidney Disease: Hypertension can damage the blood vessels and filters in the kidneys, so that the kidneys cannot excrete waste properly. Kidney disease can also cause high blood pressure, when electrolytes (including sodium) cannot be adequately secreted from the body. Stroke: Hypertension can lead to stroke, either by contributing to the process of atherosclerosis (which can lead to blockages and/or clots), or by weakening the blood vessel wall and causing it to rupture. Eye Disease: Hypertension can damage the very small blood vessels in the retina. High blood pressure often doesn't have any symptoms, so you usually don't feel it. For that reason, hypertension is usually diagnosed by a health care professional during a routine checkup. If you have a close relative with hypertension, or other risk factors, it is especially important to pay attention to your blood pressure reading. If your blood pressure is extremely high, you may have unusually strong headaches, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or poor exercise tolerance. If you have any of these symptoms, seek an evaluation promptly. High blood pressure treatment usually involves making lifestyle changes and, if necessary, drug therapy. Lifestyle changes for high blood pressure include: Losing weight Quitting smoking Eating a healthy diet, such as the DASH diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains and low in salt and fat Reducing the amount of salt in your diet Regular aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking) Limiting alcohol consumption Seeking treatment for sleep apnea Commonly prescribed high blood pressure drugs include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers (alpha-adrenergic antagonists). If you are over age 60, the goal of hypertension treatment is a systolic pressure of 150 and a diastolic pressure of 90. The goal of treatment is 140/90 for those under age 60. For people over 65, the goal bp is less than 130/85. As is true with any medication, high blood pressure drugs have side effects. Among the most common are the following: Diuretics: headache, weakness, low potassium blood levels ACE inhibitors: dry and persistent cough, headache, diarrhea, high potassium blood levels Angiotensin receptor blockers: fatigue, dizziness or fainting, diarrhea, conjestion, high potassium blood levels Calcium channel blockers: dizziness, heart rhythm problems, ankle swelling, constipation Beta-blockers: dizziness or lightheadedness, decreased sexual ability, drowsiness, fatigue, low heart rate Alpha-blockers: dizziness, headache, pounding heartbeat, nausea, weakness, weight gain A healthy diet, such as the DASH ( Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, is effective in helping to lower high blood pressure. The DASH diet calls for a certain number of daily servings from various food groups, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The following steps can also help: Eating more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods Eating less of foods that are high in saturated fat and cholesterol, such as fried foods Eating more whole grain products, fish, poultry, and nuts Eating less red meat and sweets Eating foods that are high in magnesium, potassium, and calcium Eating foods with less sodium If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, it's important to see your doctor on a regular basis. He or she can answer your questions during these visits. However, there may be other times when you may need to speak to your doctor. For instance: If you aren't responding to the prescribed treatment and your blood pressure is still high If you are having any side effects from the blood pressure medication; if this happens, your doctor may wish to adjust the dosage of the medication or put you on another medication. Some drugs that you take for another condition may increase blood pressure. These include amphetamines, methylphenidate ( Concerta, Metadate, Methylin, Ritalin), corticosteroids, hormones (including birth control pills), certain migraine medications, cyclosporine, and erythropoietin. Also, many over-the-counter medications that contain pseudoephedrine and ephedrine (for example, allergy and cold medicines and appetite suppressants) can increase blood pressure. Don't stop taking any prescribed medication, including high blood pressure drugs, without talking to your doctor."
417,"Drink plenty of fluids even if you don't feel thirsty. Children are especially prone to dehydration. Drink bottled or boiled water, bottled or canned soft drinks, or clear broths for the first 24 hours. Avoid caffeinated, sugary, and alcoholic drinks, which can worsen diarrhea. If you have diarrhea more than 4 times a day, or are more at risk of dehydration (kids and seniors), use premixed oral rehydration solutions available at drug stores. They provide a balance of water and electrolytes (potassium and sodium) lost in your stools. If you do not feel like eating solid foods at first, you may start the BRAT diet -- bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast -- or salted soda crackers, boiled potatoes, and cereals after 24 hours. Avoiding dairy products for the first 24 hours may help. Slowly advance to regular foods. Over-the-counter medications may reduce cramping and control traveler's diarrhea, but antimotilty drugs like loperamide ( Imodium) or diphenoxylate ( Lomotil) should not be used if you have bloody diarrhea, fever, or pain. If diarrhea is bloody, or if you have a fever or abdominal pain, see a healthcare provider immediately. Do not take over-the-counter drugs. If diarrhea continues after several days despite home treatment, see your healthcare provider. He or she may prescribe an antibiotic. If diarrhea still persists, the healthcare provider may check your stool for bacteria or parasites. Take a child to a doctor if symptoms include bloody diarrhea, dehydration, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit. See a health care provider if nausea or vomiting is severe enough to prevent rehydration or if you feel woozy or have a rapid heartbeat."
418,"Men who don't have sperm in their semen have a condition called azoospermia. It happens to about 1% of all men and 15% of infertile men. There aren't really any symptoms that you'd notice, but if you've been trying to get your partner pregnant without success, this condition could be the cause. You might have a problem that keeps your testicles from making sperm or that stops sperm from getting out of your body. There are three main types of azoospermia: Pretesticular azoospermia: Your testicles are normal, but your body can't get them to make sperm. It might happen because of low hormone levels or after you've had chemotherapy. This type is pretty rare. Testicular azoospermia: Damage to your testicles keeps them from making sperm normally. It can happen because of: An infection in your reproductive tract, such as epididymitis and urethritis A childhood illness such as viral orchitis, which causes swelling of one or both testicles A groin injury Cancer or its treatments, like radiation Genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter's syndrome Post-testicular azoospermia: Your testicles make normal sperm, but something keeps them from getting out, like: A blockage in the tubes that carry sperm from your testicles to your penis. This is called obstructive azoospermia. A vasectomy Retrograde ejaculation, when semen goes into your bladder instead of out of your penis during an orgasm About 40% of men with azoospermia have the post-testicular type. If you've been trying without luck to get your partner pregnant, your doctor might check you for this condition. First, you'll give samples of your semen, and a lab will examine them with a high-powered microscope. If the results show no sperm in your semen on two separate occasions, then you've got azoospermia. Your doctor will then try to figure out what's causing the problem. She'll give you a complete physical exam, ask you about your medical history, and test your blood to measure your hormone levels. If your hormone levels are normal, your doctor may order a scrotal or transrectal ultrasound to look for an obstruction. A MRI may confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes, surgery is the only way to find the obstruction. If you don't have a blockage, genetic tests can find out if you have a problem in your genes. There are a few types of treatment that can help men with azoospermia who want to have children. If you have the obstructive type, surgery can remove the blockage. The more recent your blockage, the more likely it is that the surgery will be successful. Sperm retrieval can help men with nonobstructive azoospermia or those who have a blockage but don't want surgery. One way to do this is to use a tiny needle to draw sperm from a testicle. Then, you can freeze the sample to use later in in vitro fertilization ( IVF). If you have a testicular biopsy, your doctor can retrieve sperm at the same time, so you won't need a second surgery."
419,"You probably call it hay fever, but your doctor might refer to it as allergic rhinitis. It's most likely to strike when pollen ramps up in the spring and summer. You don't have to be exposed to hay to have it. And no matter what name it goes by, it causes these symptoms: Prolonged, sometimes violent sneezing Itchy nose, throat, and roof of mouth Stuffy, runny nose Postnasal drip that causes coughing Watery, itchy eyes Head and nasal congestion Ear pressure or fullness Fatigue Sneezing When to call your doctor: Your symptoms become so severe that they stop you from living a normal life. You can't control it with over-the-counter medications. You get an infection in congested sinus cavities. The symptoms of that are a fever, facial pain, postnasal drip, bad breath, and sinus or tooth pain or tenderness."
420,"Most people with rheumatoid arthritis have some pain. You can take steps to keep it from stopping you. Tell your doctor how you feel. He may want to change your medications or their doses. It's important for you let him know what's going on. Don't say â I'm fine,â or, â It's OKâ if it's really not. Take a breathing break. Quietly tune in to your breaths. Breathe in and out normally. Just notice each one. If other thoughts come up (and they will), let them go and turn your attention back to your breath. It's a simple way to tune in and calm down. Even a few minutes a day can help. Keep doing things you enjoy. The activities you love help you feel good inside and out. If some are hard to do when your RA flares up, ask your doctor or a physical therapist for tips to make them easier. Use heat, cold, and massage. Put an ice pack on an inflamed area. Use heat to warm up a stiff joint. Gentle massage can also give quick relief for mild symptoms. Notice your emotions. If your pain starts to make you feel bad a lot of the time -- you're depressed, angry, or anxious often -- tell your doctor, or talk with a professional counselor. It may help to do cognitive behavioral training, where you learn new, positive ways to handle pain and other problems. Join a support group. You'll be able to talk with people who know what you are going through because they've been in the same situation. Exercise. It makes your joints feel better. Even if you're in pain, there probably are some exercises you can do. Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist to get ideas about which activities (such as swimming, biking, or brisk walking) could work for you. Eat a balanced diet. Go for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. A registered dietitian can give you ideas about meal plans and recipes. Drink alcohol only in moderation. Don't smoke! It often takes several tries to quit, but it's worth it."
421,"Your ankles ache and your fingers are stiff and swollen. Could it be rheumatoid arthritis ( RA)? Tests may provide a clue. Doctors diagnose RA based largely on your medical history and a physical exam. You may also get lab tests, including the following. This test finds immune system chemicals, called antibodies, that target CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide), which is present in about 60% to 70% of people with RA. You could have these antibodies years before you get RA symptoms. This test can also predict cases of RA that could become severe. Drawbacks: It misses 10% to 15% of cases of RA. Rheumatoid factor ( RF) is part of the immune system's overactive response. It shows up in the blood of about 70% to 80% of people with RA. High levels of it are linked to more severe cases. Drawbacks: It misses 20% to 30% of cases of RA. It also shows up in other conditions, including: Chronic hepatitis Chronic viral infection Dermatomyositis Infectious mononucleosis Leukemia Scleroderma Sjogren's syndrome Lupus It's uncommon, but some healthy people can have RF in their blood test results. People with lupus often have high levels of these immune system chemicals. So do some, but not all, people with RA. Drawbacks: By itself, this test does not diagnose RA. This test gauges how much inflammation is in the body. It's usually higher than normal in people with RA and other inflammatory diseases. Doctors may use this test to see whether treatment has lowered inflammation. Drawbacks: The test doesn't diagnose RA or any other disease. It also doesn't show why someone has inflammation. C-reactive protein is a sign of inflammation. A high CRP could mean someone has an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. But the test doesn't diagnose any condition. Many doctors consider it to be a better test than the âsed rateâ to measure inflammation. You may get this test to see how well your RA treatment is working. Drawbacks: Like the sed rate, the CRP test only tells you that there is inflammation. It does not show the cause. Also, not all people with RA have high CRP levels. Sometimes doctors order tests to analyze samples of joint fluid, also called synovial fluid. They remove it from the joint space with a needle. Drawbacks: This test can't specifically show that you have RA. But finding fluid with evidence of inflammation supports the diagnosis. X-rays of the joints help find and track rheumatoid arthritis. Drawbacks: X-rays aren't sensitive enough to show early RA damage. And they only show harm to joints and bones, not soft tissue like ligaments, tendons, or muscles."
422,"Well-controlled blood sugars help children with diabetes grow and develop normally. Your doctor will help you figure out what levels are right for your child, since targets change as kids get older. Test your child's blood sugar several times a day so you'll know what you need to do to adjust it. Your goal is simple: Get it into the target range when it isn't. What causes ups and downs? Food Exercise Growth and hormones Illness Stress and other emotions Medication No one expects a growing child's blood sugar levels to be normal all the time. And when your child enters puberty, his hormones could cause problems with blood sugars changing wildly. Remember, the numbers on the meter aren't ""good"" or ""bad"" -- they're just numbers. They give you information about how to keep your child healthy. Since you or your child might not notice symptoms, testing is the best way to avoid dangerously high and low levels. Help kids learn to manage their diabetes on their own. Encourage good habits. Praise your child when he tests, regardless of the result. Don't let him feel bad or blame him when his levels are out of range. Offer support to get him back on track."
423,"When your family dog doesn't want to eat and is throwing up, you hope it's a passing thing.  Many times, it is -- but it could be a condition called pancreatitis. If so, he'll need treatment. The condition happens when the pancreas becomes inflamed. That's an organ near the stomach that helps digest food and control blood sugar. Pancreatitis can come on all at once and then pass, or it can stay for longer periods. Often, a dog: Loses appetite Vomits Has belly pain Other symptoms are: A fever or low body temperature Diarrhea No energy A hard time breathing Dehydration Irregular heartbeat If your dog has some of these problems for more than a day, or if these symptoms keep coming back, take him to the vet. It could be pancreatitis, or it could be something else. Either way, you should get it checked out. Your vet might make a diagnosis based on symptoms alone. Usually, though, she'll need to do blood tests or an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make an image of what's going on inside the body. Experts aren't sure what causes the pancreas irritation, but some breeds, especially schnauzers, are more prone to it. Older dogs and ones who are overweight are also more likely to get it. Sometimes, the condition comes on as a side effect to a drug, or after surgery. More commonly, a fatty meal, like bacon grease or table scraps, triggers it. Dogs usually recover from mild cases, but if it's severe, it can sometimes lead to death. If your vet can figure out what caused the pancreatitis, he'll try to deal with that first. For instance, if it was a reaction to a drug, he may take him off it. If it's related to diet, he may put him on prescription food. Sometimes it's hard to tell what causes it, and there's no clear treatment to fight it. The focus instead becomes keeping the dog as comfortable as possible until the attack passes. For the first 24 hours, your vet may recommend no food or water, or may continue to give your pet food. Pain medications are usually given by injection. These things give the pancreas a rest. Giving your dog IV fluids is also a common practice for pancreatitis. When he gets home, you'll need to give him lots of water to make sure he doesn't get dehydrated. He may need medication for pain, too. He may also get drugs to help ease nausea and vomiting. When your dog starts eating again, make sure it's a low-fat diet. Look for food that's easy to digest. Discuss food options with your vet. If this is a single, sudden attack, it's a good idea to stick with this diet for a week or so. However, if your dog has experienced several episodes, then this new way of eating will be for life. Watch your dog's diet. Make sure he doesn't have too much high-fat food. Don't cave to his puppy-dog eyes, even on special occasions. Your dog doesn't need to eat human food. Keep your garbage secure. Vets report more cases of pancreatitis during the holidays, when people are eating more fatty foods and so are their pets."
424,"Can food be medicine? Sometimes, yes. It's becoming clear in recent years that what you eat can be highly effective in preventing or reversing some health problems, especially chronic constipation. Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. There are some serious medical conditions that can cause chronic constipation. Make sure you see your doctor for a medical evaluation. If you are healthy and looking for safe and effective long-term relief for chronic constipation, you might find help on your grocer's shelves. Hundreds of foods and plant-based fiber products are available to relieve constipation -- naturally. Dietary fiber refers to the edible parts of plants or carbohydrates that cannot be digested. Fiber is in all plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. You can also find a form of fiber called chitin in the shells of crustaceans such as crab, lobster, and shrimp. No, some fibers are soluble in water and others are insoluble. Soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool, helping the stool pass more quickly through the intestines. Most plant foods contain some of each kind of fiber. Foods containing high levels of soluble fiber include dried beans, oats, oat bran, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, apples, strawberries, peas, and potatoes. Foods high in insoluble fiber include wheat bran, whole grains, cereals, seeds, and the skins of many fruits and vegetables. Go for whole-grain breads, cereals, and pastas. Cereal fibers generally have cell walls that resist digestion and retain water within the cellular structures. Wheat bran can be highly effective as a natural laxative. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The fiber found in citrus fruits and legumes stimulate the growth of colonic flora, which increases the stool weight and the amount of bacteria in the stool. Encouraging the growth of certain bacteria in the colon may help promote a healthy intestine. The average American gets about 15 grams of fiber daily, much less than we need, according to the American Dietetic Association. Women younger than 51 should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily. Men younger than 51 should aim for 38 grams of fiber daily. Women 51 and older should get 21 grams of fiber daily. Men 51 and older should get 30 grams daily. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends eating at least nine servings (2 cups) of fiber-filled fruits and vegetables each day, including apples, oranges, broccoli, berries, pears, peas, figs, carrots, and beans. Some people get stomach cramps and gas when they increase their intake of fiber. Change your diet gradually and increase fluids to reduce discomfort. Often called "" Nature's Remedy,"" prunes contain sorbitol, which has a natural, laxative effect in the body. Dried plums (yes, prunes!) are also high in disease-fighting antioxidants and have both insoluble and soluble fiber. One cup of pitted, uncooked prunes contains 12 grams of fiber. Three dried plums have 3.9 grams of fiber. Then try foods that contain psyllium seed husk, bran, and methylcellulose, or try fiber supplements. These natural products increase stool weight and have a laxative effect. Be sure to drink a lot of water when taking any of these products, as they can clog up the intestines and cause constipation. Fiber must have water in order to sweep the colon and move the stool out of your body. It's best to get fiber from food. But if you can't eat enough fruits and vegetables to make a difference, then opt for fiber supplements. Examples include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. With psyllium powder, mix the powder in a glass of water one to three times daily. Be sure to drink enough water along with this psyllium powder drink. The drink may cause you to feel bloated until you get used to the fiber. A high-fiber diet ends chronic constipation for many people. But those who have slow transit or pelvic floor dysfunction may respond poorly to increased dietary fiber. If you have a change in frequency of bowel movements and develop acute constipation, talk to your doctor. The constipation could be caused by an underlying medical condition."
425,"Medulloblastoma is the most common kind of cancerous brain tumor in children under age 16. It's typically found between ages 3 and 8. About 500 children in the U. S. are diagnosed with a medulloblastoma each year. They're more common in boys than in girls, and they happen less often in adults. These tumors start near the base of the skull -- in the cerebellum. This is the part of the brain that controls balance and motor skills. The tumors tend to grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the brain, spinal cord, and bone marrow. Doctors don't know why these tumors appear, but people with some conditions, including Li- Fraumeni syndrome and Gorlin syndrome, are more likely to get them. In rare cases, they can be passed from parents to their children. Some of the first symptoms include: Behavioral problems Changes in handwriting Clumsiness or other balance problems Headaches Nausea or vomiting in the morning Tilting the head to one side Vision problems Once the medulloblastoma has spread to the spinal cord, you also might notice: Back pain Bladder and bowel control problems Trouble walking If your child has symptoms, his pediatrician will want to do a few tests to find out what's going on. These may include a physical exam and a neurological exam, which checks reflexes, senses, and muscle strength among other things. The doctor also may recommend the following: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the inside of your child's brain and spine. CT scan (computerized tomography): An X-ray machine takes detailed pictures of your child's brain from different angles. PET scan (positron emission tomography): Radiation is used to make 3-dimensional color images so the doctor can find the cancer cells. Your child's treatment will depend on whether the cancer has spread. The doctor probably will recommend one or more of the following: Surgery: This is usually the first step. The goal is to cut out as much of the cancer as possible without affecting nearby areas of the brain. Your child's doctor will also take a small piece of the tumor (called a biopsy) to confirm that it's cancer. Chemotherapy: The doctor will likely suggest this after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. It's given through an IV or with pills. Radiation therapy: This is also used to kill cancer cells. It uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation. It also can slow the growth of tumors the doctor couldn't remove during surgery. Proton therapy: A low dose of radiation is sent directly to the tumor. This is more precise than radiation therapy and can prevent damage to healthy tissue and organs. About 70% to 80% of children who are treated for an average-risk tumor (one that isn't difficult for doctors to get to) are free of cancer five years after their diagnosis."
426,"Kidney cancer -- also called renal cancer -- is a disease in which kidney cells become malignant (cancerous) and grow out of control, forming a tumor. Almost all kidney cancers first appear in the lining of tiny tubes (tubules) in the kidney. This type of kidney cancer is called renal cell carcinoma. The good news is that most of kidney cancers are found before they spread (metastasize) to distant organs. And cancers caught early are easier to treat successfully. However, these tumors can grow to be quite large before they are detected.  The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They lie in your lower abdomen on each side of your spine. Their main job is to clean your blood, removing waste products and making urine. Doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer. But certain factors appear to increase the risk of getting kidney cancer. For example, kidney cancer occurs most often in people older than age 40. These are some other risk factors for kidney cancer: Smoking . If you smoke cigarettes, your risk for kidney cancer is twice that of nonsmokers. Smoking cigars may also increase your risk. Being male. Men are about twice as likely as women to get kidney cancer. Being obese. Extra weight may cause changes to hormones that increase your risk. Using certain pain medications for a long time. This includes over-the-counter drugs in addition to prescription drugs. Having advanced kidney disease or being on long-term dialysis, a treatment for people with kidneys that have stopped working Having certain genetic conditions, such as von Hippel- Lindau ( VHL) disease or inherited papillary renal cell carcinoma Having a family history of kidney cancer. The risk is especially high in siblings. Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as asbestos, cadmium, benzene, organic solvents, or certain herbicides Having high blood pressure. Doctors don't know whether high blood pressure or medication used to treat it is the source of the increased risk. Being black. The risk in blacks is slightly higher than in whites. No one knows why. Having lymphoma. For an unknown reason, there is an increased risk of kidney cancer in patients with lymphoma. Having these risk factors does not mean you will get kidney cancer. And it's also true that you can have none of them and still get the disease. In many cases, people may have no early symptoms of kidney cancer. As the tumor grows larger, symptoms may appear. You may have one or more of these kidney cancer symptoms: Blood in your urine A lump in your side or abdomen A loss of appetite A pain in your side that doesn't go away Weight loss that occurs for no known reason Fever that lasts for weeks and isn't caused by a cold or other infection Extreme fatigue Anemia Swelling in your ankles or legs Kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of your body may cause other symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Bone pain Maybe you've had kidney cancer symptoms such as pain in your side, weight loss, or extreme fatigue. Or maybe your doctor has found a lump in your side during a routine exam or a sign of kidney cancer during a test for another disease. Regardless, to confirm a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you will need a thorough physical exam, health history, and tests. Your doctor will feel your abdomen and side for lumps and check for fever and high blood pressure, among other things. You will also answer questions about your health habits, any past illnesses, and types of treatment. To make a diagnosis of kidney cancer, your doctor will also order one or more tests like these: Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems. Blood tests show how well your kidneys are working. Intravenous pyelogram ( IVP) involves X-raying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract, highlighting any tumors. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys. It can help tell if a tumor is solid or fluid-filled. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys. This may also require an injection of dye. CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body. You may need an injection of a contrast agent to create better pictures. Renal arteriogram. This test is used to evaluate the blood supply to the tumor. It is not given often, but may help diagnose small tumors. It has other uses, as well. Unlike with many other cancers, your doctor may be pretty certain about a diagnosis of kidney cancer without a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A doctor may use a needle biopsy to remove a sample of tissue, which is then examined under a microscope for cancer cells. The biopsy may also tell the grade of the cancer -- how aggressive the cancer is likely to be. Often the surgeon will simply remove the entire tumor and then have a sample of tissue examined. Once your doctor makes a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you may need other tests to tell if the cancer has spread within your kidney, to the other kidney, or to other parts of your body. When cancer spreads from the place where it first started, it has metastasized. You might need a CT scan or MRI. A chest X-ray can show whether the cancer has spread to your lungs. A bone scan can see if it is in your bones. These tests will help your doctor determine the stage of kidney cancer. Your prognosis depends on your general health, as well as the grade and stage of your kidney cancer. These are the stages of kidney cancer. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer. Stage I A tumor 7 centimeters or smaller that is only in the kidney Stage II A tumor larger than 7 centimeters that is only in the kidney Stage III A tumor that is in the kidney and in at least one nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the kidney's main blood vessel and may also be in nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the fatty tissue around the kidney and may also involve nearby lymph nodes A tumor that extends into major veins or perinephric tissues, but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia Stage IV Cancer has spread beyond the fatty layer of tissue around the kidney, and it may also be in nearby lymph nodes Cancer may have spread to other organs, such as the bowel, pancreas, or lungs Cancer has spread beyond Gerota's fascia (including contiguous extension into the ipsilateral adrenal gland) Once you have a diagnosis and know your stage of kidney cancer, you and your doctor can plan treatment. You may want to gather information to help you feel more informed about your decision. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for treatment. This could include an urologist, a medical or radiation oncologist, or a surgeon. Before beginning treatment, many people find it helpful to get a second opinion about the diagnosis of kidney cancer and the treatment plan. Kidney cancer is one of the more common cancers to undergo spontaneous regression, in which it may return to an eralier stage. However, the incidence is quite low (approximately 0.5%). There are several standard types of treatment for kidney cancer. In most cases, surgery is the first step. Even if surgery removes the entire tumor, though, your doctor may suggest an extra treatment to kill any remaining cancer cells that can't be seen. Surgery for kidney cancer These are the main types of surgery for kidney cancer. Which type you have depends on how advanced your cancer is. Radical nephrectomy removes the kidney, adrenal gland, and surrounding tissue. It also often removes nearby lymph nodes. It is the most common surgery for kidney cancer and can now be done through a small incision with a laparoscope. Simple nephrectomy removes the kidney only. Partial nephrectomy removes the cancer in the kidney along with some tissue around it. This procedure is used for patients with smaller tumors (less than 4 cm) or in those patients in which a radical nephrectomy might hurt the other kidney. You can survive with just a part of one kidney as long as it is still working. If the surgeon removes both kidneys or if both kidneys are not working, you will need a machine to clean your blood (dialysis) or a new kidney (kidney transplant). A transplant is possible if your cancer was found only in your kidney and a donated kidney is available. If surgery can't remove your kidney cancer, your doctor may suggest another option to help destroy the tumor. Cryotherapy uses extreme cold to kill the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation uses high-energy radio waves to ""cook"" the tumor. Arterial embolization involves inserting material into an artery that leads to the kidney. This blocks blood flow to the tumor. This procedure may be done to help shrink the tumor before surgery. Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses. Substances for biologic therapy are made by your body or in a lab. Examples of biologic therapy for metastatic kidney cancer include interferon alpha or interleukin-2. There are many new immunotherapies being actively studied for kidney cancer. Targeted therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs or other substances to find and target cancer cells with less toxicity to normal cells. One type of targeted therapy is anti-angiogenic agents. These keep blood vessels from feeding a tumor, causing it to shrink or stop growing. Another type of targeted agent is known as multikinase inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These are oral drugs that block an enzyme pathway which allows cancer cells to grow. A third type of targeted therapy is known as m- TOR inhibitors. There are two of these drugs available, one oral and one by IV. They block a pathway which allows blood vessels to help tumor cells grow. Each of these drugs has a unique place in the management of advanced kidney cancer. Radiation therapy for kidney cancer Often used to help with symptoms of kidney cancer or in patients who cannot have surgery, this treatment uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or halt their growth. External radiation therapy sends radiation to the cancer from a machine outside the body. Chemotherapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplying. Less effective for kidney cancer than for other types of cancer, chemotherapy is mostly used for a certain type of kidney cancer in which there spindle cells (sarcomatoid variant). Because doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer, it is not clear how to prevent the disease. However, certain factors are linked to kidney cancer, so you can take certain steps to lower your risk -- quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, manage your blood pressure, and avoid being exposed to harmful chemicals."
427,"Your arms and legs feel tingly again. Your eyes start to blur, and you see spots and colored flashes. Now you feel lightheaded and smell strange odors. You've been here enough to know what's next. You've got a migraine. You know how yours start, but have no idea why you get them. What makes you more likely than some other people to get these awful headaches? And what exactly is a migraine? It's a disabling condition that causes an extremely painful headache that is accompanied by nausea or vomiting, and sensitivity to lights and sounds. The head pain that happens with migraine is usually a severe, pounding headache that can last hours or even days. But migraine is much more than just a headache. Other symptoms vary from person to person, but you may see spots, have blurred vision, or smell strange odors. You might be sensitive to light, feel sick to your stomach, and even vomit. Doctors aren't totally sure what causes migraine headaches, but they think imbalances in certain brain chemicals may play a role. Your genes and other things are also likely reasons. While researchers haven't been able to pinpoint a cause, they know that several things raise your chances of having migraines, including: 1. Your genes. If someone in your family gets migraine headaches, you're more likely to get them than someone without that family history. 2. Your age. Migraine headaches can hit at any point in your life, but you're more likely to get your first one in your teens. The headaches tend to peak in your 30s and become less severe later in life. 3. Your gender. Women are about three times more likely to get them than men. 4. Nerve signals and brain chemicals. The trigeminal nerve, located in your head, runs your eyes and mouth. It also helps you feel sensations in your face and is a major pathway for pain. When your serotonin level drops at the start of a migraine, this nerve may release chemicals called neurotransmitters that travel to the brain and cause pain. 5. Hormonal changes. Shifts in the hormone estrogen can bring on migraines in women. Medications like birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy can bring on headaches or make them worse. But some women have fewer migraines when they take these medications. 6. Emotional stress . This is one of the most common migraine triggers. That's because when you're stressed, your brain releases chemicals that cause your âfight or flightâ response. Anxiety, worry, and fear can create even more tension and make a migraine worse. 7. Certain foods. Salty, processed foods and aged cheeses like blue cheese are known triggers. And the artificial sweetener aspartame, and flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate, or MSG, may cause them, too. 8. Skipping meals. If you miss a meal, your blood sugar could drop, triggering a headache. 9. Alcohol and caffeine. Do you ever get a raging headache after that glass of wine? Alcoholic drinks and drinks high in caffeine can be migraine triggers. 10. Sensory overload. Bright lights, loud sounds, and strong smells can bring on these headaches in some people. 11. Changes in your sleep pattern. If you get too much or too little sleep, you may get a migraine. Traveling between time zones? Jet lag can be a cause, too. 12. Physical strain . An intense workout, like heavy exercise or even sex, can cause a migraine. You should still be active, but you might do better with a more moderate pace. 13. Changes in weather. This is a big trigger. So is a change in the overall air pressure. 14. Too much medication. If you have migraines and take medications for them more than 10 days in a month, you may be setting yourself up for what's called a rebound headache. Your doctor will probably call it a medication overuse headache. While you might not be able to prevent migraine triggers altogether, some simple things -- like regular, good-quality sleep, a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management -- may help you stop them before they start."
428,"Shingles (herpes zoster) results from a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that also causes chickenpox. With shingles, usually the first thing you may notice is a tingling sensation or burning pain on one side of your body or face. Within days, tiny clusters of red bumps quickly evolve into a group of painful blisters which can pop and get crusty with pus. Unless you are immunocompromised, the rash almost never crosses the midline of your body (it's unilateral) because it is localized to one nerve root. The area can be very painful, itchy, and tender. After one to two weeks, the blisters heal and form scabs. Up to 15% of people with herpes zoster develop deep pain called postherpetic neuralgia that follows after the infection has run its course. It can continue for months or even years, especially in older people. The incidence of shingles and of postherpetic neuralgia rises with increasing age. In fact, more than 50% of cases occur in people over age 60. Shingles usually occurs only once, although it has been known to recur, usually in people with weakened immune systems. Shingles arises from varicella-zoster, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Following a bout of chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in the spinal nerve cells. But it can be reactivated years later when the immune system is suppressed by: Physical or emotional trauma A serious illness Certain medications, like steroids Medical science doesn't understand why the virus becomes reactivated in some people and not in others."
429,"When someone hits you -- or you bump into something hard -- it can break the small blood vessels beneath your skin. That's where a bruise forms. This happens because the blood leaks out and has nowhere else to go. It stays there until your body absorbs it while you're healing. Once you're bruised, you'll have that telltale black-and-blue mark on your skin for up to 2 weeks. The bruise should change colors as it heals. You may also have some pain and swelling. It will hurt most in the first few days after your injury. When you're bruised, there are simple things you can do to try to help the healing process along. These tips may help your bruise go away more quickly: Put ice on your bruise right after you get injured. That can reduce the size of your bruise, which may allow it to heal faster. The cold temperature from an ice pack makes the blood in that area flow more slowly. It may reduce the amount of blood that leaks out of your vessels. Don't put ice directly on your bruise -- protect your skin by wrapping the ice in a washcloth or paper towel. Remove the ice from your skin after about 10 minutes. Leaving it on too long could harm your skin. It's OK to put ice on your bruise several times a day, as long as you take a break after every time you do it. Peas, yes. Steak, no. You may have seen people in old movies or cartoons putting raw steaks on their bruises -- especially on black eyes. Don't do this yourself. It's not safe to handle raw meat or place it against your eye or another body part, since it may be loaded with bacteria. Steaks and other raw meats don't have special healing powers that can help a bruise. Raw meat tends to be cold, so that's why it may have been used to soothe sore spots in decades past. If you don't have any ice in your freezer, reach for a bag of frozen peas instead of a steak. Place the whole bag of veggies on your bruise for 10 minutes at a time to ease the pain, just like you would with ice. Stop what you're doing when you get hurt. That can keep the bruise from getting worse. If you get kicked during a soccer game, head off the field. Get off your feet. This slows down the blood flow to your bruise. That should keep it from becoming worse than if you kept running around. You may want to massage the sore spot when you're resting, but it's a bad idea. That can make the injured spot worse. You may break more blood vessels under the skin and make the bruised the area larger. After you're injured, it helps if you raise it above the level of your heart. This trick uses gravity to help keep your bruise as small as can be. When the sore spot is below the level of your heart, the blood there pools more easily, which can make the bruise larger. But when the sore spot is lifted above your heart, more blood will flow back to your heart. For best results, combine steps: Rest the bruise and raise it above the level of your heart at the same time. You can also place ice on the injured spot in 10-minute segments. Your pain should begin to subside about 3 days after you were bruised. In the meantime, if the bruise really hurts or is swollen, you can take over-the-counter drugs to relieve your pain. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen can be used, though there is a slight increase in bleeding especially in elderly patients or in those already on a blood thinner."
430,"If you have scalp psoriasis, the itchy, painful scales may keep you awake at night. Nearly half the people who have it also have sleep problems. Luckily, there are easy ways to get more rest. Moisture can soothe your scalp and calm the itch. Take a warm shower before you go to sleep every night. Wash your hair each time. Try an over-the-counter shampoo for people with psoriasis. Look for one with tar, ketoconazole, or salicylic acid. Dandruff shampoo may also help. To give it time to work, leave it on your scalp for 5 minutes before you rinse it out. If your doctor gave you a cream or other medicine to use during your shower, put it on your wet scalp before you shampoo. Leave it on for the prescribed period of time, then wash and rinse as usual. Always use conditioner. It will help keep your skin moist. Shampoo alone can dry out your scalp. After your shower, gently rub any over-the-counter creams or scale softeners that you have into your scalp. If your doctor has prescribed medicine for you to leave on, apply it now. Put a dry shower cap over your hair before you slip into bed. This will keep it damp and hold medicine in. It may make your head sweat as you sleep, adding even more moisture. How you unwind at the end of the day can help you nod off. Go to bed at the same time every night. Keep your bedroom cool. Choose sheets, pillows, blankets, and pajamas in soft fabrics. Relax for an hour before bed. Avoid gadgets with bright screens like TVs, computers and smartphones. Get out of bed if you can't sleep. Do something quiet until you feel tired, but again, no screen time. Your sleep problems could be tied to a psoriasis flare. If the itching and pain keep you awake for more than a couple of nights, call your dermatologist. She can suggest a new treatment. Control stress when you can, at work and at home. Learn some techniques to relax. Try to exercise every day, and leave enough time to rest at night. Scrapes and sunburns can trigger psoriasis. Be gentle when you scratch your head. Wear sunscreen and a hat when you go outdoors. To lower chances that you'll get strep throat or another illness, wash your hands often. Don't share forks or spoons with others."
431,"Psoriasis turns your skin cells into type A overachievers: They grow about five times faster than normal skin cells. And your body can't keep up. The old ones pile up instead of sloughing off, making thick, flaky, itchy patches. Why do these cells go a little haywire? There's more going on under the surface of this skin disease. Researchers think something sets off your immune system. The exact reason is a mystery. But it's likely a combination of genetics and triggers. Little bits of your DNA, called genes, are instructions for your cells. They control things like your eye and hair color, if you can taste certain things, and other ways your body works. Some genes are only active at certain times. When you have psoriasis, the genes that control your immune system signals get mixed up. Instead of protecting your body from invaders as it's designed to do, it promotes inflammation and turns skin cells on overdrive. Scientists have found about 25 genes that are different in people with psoriasis. They think it takes more than one to cause the disease, and they're looking for the main ones. About 10 in every 100 people have genes that make them more likely to get psoriasis, but only two or three of them actually do. The disease often shows up or flares during puberty. Menopause can also trigger it. During pregnancy, your symptoms may get better or even go away. But after the baby's born, you might have a flare. Heavy drinkers have a higher risk, especially younger men. Alcohol can make treatments less effective, too. Lighting up can double your risk of getting psoriasis. If you also have relatives with the disease, you're nine times more likely to get it. And smoking makes it harder to get rid of symptoms. It's closely linked with a hard-to-treat type called pustular psoriasis, which affects the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. Scientists think your immune system may respond to emotional and mental pressures the same way it does to physical problems like injuries and infections. Some treatments can make psoriasis worse. These include: Lithium, which treats bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses High blood pressure and heart medicines, including propranolol ( Inderal) and other beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and quinidine Antimalarial medicines, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil), and quinacrine Indomethacin ( Indocin), which treats inflammation Psoriasis usually is worse in the beginning stages of HIV infection, but then it gets better after you start certain treatments. Strep infections, in particular, are linked with guttate psoriasis, which looks like small, red drops. Kids will often have strep throat before their first flare. Earaches, bronchitis, tonsillitis, or a respiratory infection such as a cold, the flu, or skin problems. A little natural sunlight is good for most people with psoriasis. But for a few, the sun makes their condition worse. So can a bad sunburn, so protect your skin if you're going to be outside. A cut, scrape, bug bite, infection, or too much scratching can trigger the condition. People who are obese tend to get plaques in their skin creases and folds. Your psoriasis might be worse in the winter. Dry air, less natural sunlight, and cold temperatures can make symptoms worse. Keep your skin moist, and try a humidifier at home."
432,"The signs of a black eye include bruising and swelling of the eyelid and soft tissue around the injured eye, sometimes accompanied by broken blood vessels along the white of the eye, called a subconjunctival hemorrhage. The discoloration starts out deep purple or blue, then may turn green or yellow before disappearing, usually in about a week. There was loss of consciousness as a result of the injury. Black eyes appear affecting one or both eyes after a head injury; you should be examined by a doctor for possible skull fracture. You have blurry or double vision. You can't move your eyeball in all directions. Any of the symptoms below may indicate damage to the eyeball, which should be evaluated and treated by an eye care specialist: Your eyeball hurts. You have an open cut around the eye. You have blurred vision, or see multiple images or floating spots. You are bleeding from the eye. You experience unusual sensitivity to light or other vision changes."
433,"Viral hepatitis, such as hepatitis A ( HAV), hepatitis B ( HBV) and hepatitis C ( HCV), is diagnosed by your symptoms, a physical exam and blood tests. Sometimes imaging studies such as a sonogram or CAT scan and a liver biopsy are also used. What are the types of Hepatitis ? There are several types of hepatitis, but the three most common in the U. S. are: Hepatitis A â It is considered highly contagious but is not a long-term infection and usually has no complications. Your liver usually heals within two months. Preventable with a vaccination, it can be spread by eating or drinking something that has been contaminated with the stool of a person who has the virus. Hepatitis B â While it can lead to long-term liver damage, most children and adults recover within 6 months. You can spread the virus even though you show no symptoms. A pregnant woman who is infected by the virus can pass it along to her newborn. Also, preventable through vaccine, hepatitis B is spread by: Having sex with someone who's infected Sharing dirty needles Having direct contact with infected blood or the body fluids of someone who's got the disease Hepatitis C â Usually a long-term infection, those infected often don't show symptoms. It can lead to scarring of the liver or cirrhosis. There is no vaccine to prevent it. It is spread by: Sharing dirty needles Having direct contact with infected blood or the body fluids of someone who's got the disease Have had a blood transfusion prior to screenings put in place in 1992 It is possible but less common to contact it through sex with someone who is infected Who's at Risk for Hepatitis Infection? You are at increases risk hepatis A if you meet one or more of these criteria: You knowingly have had direct contact with persons who have hepatitis A Have traveled to a country that is known to have a high incidence of HAV infection Have been in close contact with someone who has traveled to a country with a high rate of infection Are a male in a sexual relation with another male Use drugs Have a clotting factor disorder You work with primates The following groups of people should be screened for hepatitis B virus: People born in areas where HBV is endemic Men who have sex with men Intravenous drug users (both present and former users) Anyone with chronic kidney disease HIV-infected people Pregnant women Family members, household members, and sex partners of HBV-infected people (even if sex occurred on only one occasion) People who have had more than one sex partner within 6 months People who will need to be on medicines that will weaken their immune system. People with hepatitis C Children born to mothers who have HBV People with certain high liver function blood tests For hepatitis C, the CDC recommends that you have a blood test if any of the following is true: You have received an organ transplant or transfusion before July 1972. You have been notified that you received blood or an organ transplant from a donor who later tested positive for the disease You have ever injected drugs, even once many years ago You received a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before July 1992 You received a blood product used to treat clotting problems that was made before 1987 You were born between 1945 and 1965 You have had long-term kidney dialysis You have signs or symptoms of liver disease You have HIV You have a known exposure to HCV You have persistent elevations of a liver blood test called ALT (alanine aminotransferase levels) Children born to HCV-positive mothers Otherwise, routine screening for hepatitis typically is not recommended unless you have symptoms or signs (such as abnormal liver-related blood tests) of the condition. Many people with hepatitis will not have any symptoms at all. When they do occur, symptoms of all three of the most common types of hepatitis are very similar and may include: Dark urine Stomach pain Yellowing of skin or eyes Pale or clay-colored stool Low-grade fever Loss of appetite Fatigue Feeling sick to the stomach If you have hepatitis A or B, you may also have achy joints. See your doctor as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms. If you have symptoms or signs of viral hepatitis, your health care provider can perform a blood test to check for the presence of an antibody. If you have hepatitis B or C, more blood samples may be necessary later -- even if the symptoms have vanished -- to check for complications and determine if you have progressed from acute (infected within the past six months) to chronic (having the virus for greater than six months) disease. Most people have vague or no symptoms at all; hence, viral hepatitis is often referred to as a silent disease. Your healthcare provider may also require a liver biopsy, or tissue sample, in order to determine the extent of the damage. A biopsy is commonly performed by inserting a needle into the liver and drawing out a fragment of tissue, which is then sent to a lab to be analyzed. The treatment for viral hepatitis depends on the type and stage of the infection. Over the last several years, excellent treatments for both hepatitis B and C have become available. More and improved treatments are being evaluated all the time. Your primary care doctor should be able to provide adequate care of your hepatitis. However, if you have severe hepatitis, you may require treatment by a hepatologist or gastroenterologist -- specialists in diseases of the liver. Hospitalization is normally unnecessary unless you cannot eat or drink or are vomiting. Hepatitis A usually requires minimal treatment and your liver usually heals within 2 months. Make sure you stay hydrated and well-nourished. While a vaccination can prevent you from getting hepatitis A, once you have had it, you cannot be re-infected. Doctors sometimes recommend drug therapy for people with hepatitis B and C. Antiviral medication for hepatitis B includes adefovir ( Hepsera), entecavir ( Baraclude), interferon, lamivudine ( Epivir), peginterferon, telbivudine, and tenofovir ( Viread). Until recently, the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C was a course of peginterferon plus ribavirin for people with genotype 2 and 3, and peginterferon plus ribavirin plus a protease inhibitor for people with genotype 1. These treatments had been shown to be effective in from 50% to 80% of those infected with hepatitis C but the side effects were very difficult for people to tolerate. Treatment now centers around direct acting antiviral drugs ( DAAs). These medicines are highly effective for most people with hepatitis C and are interferon-free and often ribavirin-free. This means they typically have fewer side effects. The treatments are often simpler- consisting of fewer pills for a shorter amount of time. DAAs are available as either single drugs or combined with other medicines in one pill. Elbasvir-grazoprevir ( Zepatier), ledipasvir-sofosbuvir ( Harvoni), and sofosbuvir-velpatasvir ( Epclusa) and are once daily combination pills. Depending on the type of hepatitis C infection, these can often cure the disease in 8 to 12 weeks. Other treatment options include: ombitasvir-paritaprevir-rritonavir plus dasabuvir ( Viekira Pak, Viekira XR); ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir ( Technivie), or some combinations of daclatasvir ( Daklinza), peginterferon, ribavirin, or sofosbuvir ( Sovaldi). Ask your doctor what's best for you, based on your medical needs. Hepatitis in Pregnant Women If you are pregnant, your doctor will test you for hepatitis B; if you are infected with the virus, your baby will be given immune globulin shots and a hepatitis vaccination. This will help protect your baby from contracting the virus. In addition, it may be recommended that a mother with active HBV receive treatment with an antiviral medication during the third trimester of pregnancy. Hepatitis E can be fatal to a pregnant woman during her third trimester, and if the mother has hepatitis B, the baby is likely to contract the disease at birth. Other Points to Consider If your hepatitis, either viral or nonviral, is in the acute stage (occurred within the last six months), avoid alcoholic beverages, as your body's efforts to process alcohol puts an added strain on an already injured liver. Also, be aware that your sexual partners, especially if you have hepatitis B, are at risk of contracting the disease. Hepatitis C is difficult to pass through sexual contact, unless there is blood-to-blood contact. Most adults recover completely from acute hepatitis A and B within six months."
434,"Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML) is a type of blood cancer. It usually begins in cells that turn into white blood cells. Sometimes, though, AML can start in other types of blood-forming cells. Acute myeloid leukemia starts in the bone marrow. This is the soft inner parts of bones. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells don't mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, often called blast cells, keep building up. You may hear other names for acute myeloid leukemia. Doctors may call it: Acute myelocytic leukemia Acute myelogenous leukemia Acute granulocytic leukemia Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia Without treatment, AML can quickly be life-threatening. Because it's ""acute,"" this type of leukemia can spread quickly to the blood and to other parts of the body, such as the: Lymph nodes Liver Spleen Brain and spinal cord Testicles Each person is different, and how acute myeloid leukemia affects them depends on certain things, including how well the cancer responds to treatment. Your outlook is better if: You are younger than 60. You have a lower white blood cell count when you're diagnosed. You do not have a history of blood disorders or cancers. You do not have certain gene mutations or chromosome changes. Doctors often don't know why someone gets AML. But they do know about some of the ârisk factorsâ for the condition. Those are things that make you more likely get it. Acute myeloid leukemia risk factors include: Smoking Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene (a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke), pesticides, ionizing radiation, certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubin, melphalan, and mitoxantrone Exposure to high doses of radiation Certain blood disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders (for example, chronic myelogenous leukemia) A parent, brother, or sister who has had AML Although there is no way to prevent AML, you may lower your risk by not smoking and avoiding exposure to chemicals."
435,"Call your health care provider right away if you have: Unusual or severe cramping or abdominal pain Changes in your baby's movement after 28 weeks gestation (if there are less than 10 movements in 2 hours) that you notice while sitting still or lying down Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath that seems to be getting worse Signs of premature labor including: -- Regular tightening or pain in the lower abdomen or back -- Any bleeding in the second or third trimester (which may be normal after a vaginal exam or intercourse) -- Fluid leak -- Severe pressure in the pelvis or vagina ( Pressure is normal in 2nd and 3rd trimesters.) Also call your health care provider if you have any of the following conditions during pregnancy: A fever over 100 ° Fahrenheit Severe or persistent vomiting Severe diarrhea Fainting spells or dizziness Pain, burning, or trouble urinating Unusual vaginal discharge Repeated vaginal bleeding Swelling in your hands, fingers, or face Blurred vision or spots before your eyes Sore, cracked, or bleeding nipples Severe headaches Pain or cramping in your arms, legs, or chest If you aren't sure if a symptom is serious, but you just don't feel like yourself, trust your instincts and call your provider. If there is a problem, you will get prompt attention. If there isn't, you will be reassured."
436,"Anyone can develop high levels of triglycerides, a type of blood fat, but certain factors can make them likelier in women. You're more likely to have high triglycerides if you are overweight, don't exercise, have diabetes, have increased waist circumference, or have a family history of high triglycerides. That's true for men and women alike. Hypothyroidism, lupus, and treatment with corticosteroids can also raise triglyceride levels. Women are more likely to get high triglycerides if they: Take birth control pills that include estrogen Are pregnant; pregnancy can temporarily raise triglyceride levels. Have been through menopause Have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), a hormonal disorder in which women have higher levels of male hormones; PCOS can also raise the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes. Take oral estrogens or hormone replacement therapy Take prescription drugs such as tamoxifen or, to a lesser degree, raloxifene ( Evista) that target estrogen levels; doctors call this class of drugs "" SERMs,"" which stands for ""selective estrogen receptor modulators."" Your lifestyle can make a big difference in your triglyceride levels. Ask your doctor what lifestyle changes you should make, the best ways to do that, and how long it will take to make a difference in your triglyceride levels. Getting more exercise, losing extra weight, and upgrading your diet -- such as avoiding processed and sugary foods -- are likely to be on your to-do list. You should also ask your doctor whether any of your medications (such as birth control pills or hormone replacement) are linked to your high triglycerides. If so, your doctor will probably recommend changing your prescription. If those changes aren't enough, your doctor may prescribe medications such as niacin, statins, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids. Even so, lifestyle changes will be part of the plan to lower your triglycerides for good."
437,"Children who have allergic asthma cough, wheeze, and get short of breath when they breathe in pollen, mold, or other allergy triggers. It's important to treat the condition so it doesn't lead to other serious health problems. Kids can avoid their triggers, but they can also take medicines to prevent asthma and allergy symptoms. If your child has symptoms of allergic asthma, see his pediatrician, an allergist, or a pulmonologist, a doctor who specializes in asthma treatment. The doctor will write up an asthma action plan. This plan describes which medicines your child should take, how often he should take them, and what to do during an asthma attack. Children can take most of the same medicines as adults, though they sometimes take lower doses. Doctors prescribe two types of medicines to manage children's asthma symptoms: Quick-relief medicines widen the airways to stop asthma attacks when they happen. Some kids use these medicines before they exercise. Albuterol ( Pro Air HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA) is the most common quick-relief medicine. Long-term controller medicines prevent asthma attacks before they start. They're for kids who get asthma symptoms more than twice a week, nighttime symptoms more than twice a month, or those who've been to the hospital for asthma recently. They include: Budesonide ( Pulmicort) Fluticasone ( Flovent) Montelukast ( Singulair) Salmeterol ( Advair) Many kids use both types of medicine. They take long-term control medicines every day and carry quick-relief medicines with them in case of an asthma attack. Though kids often take the same medicines as adults, they can take them in different ways: Nebulizer. A machine turns the medicine into a mist your child breathes in through a mask. This approach works even for infants and toddlers. Inhaler. Your child presses the device while he takes a breath to release the medicine into his lungs. He can use a tube called a spacer to make it easier to breathe in the medicine. Chewable pills. One medicine, montelukast, comes in a form your child can swallow. Allergy medicines treat symptoms like sneezing, a runny nose, and watery eyes. You can buy some of these medicines over the counter. Others need a doctor's prescription. Antihistamines block the effects of histamine -- a chemical the body releases in response to an allergy trigger, like mold or dust mites. Your child can take these medicines as a syrup, chewable tablet, or nasal spray. Because some antihistamines cause drowsiness, you might want to give them to your child right before bedtime. What about decongestants to get rid of a stuffy nose? Doctors say these medicines aren't a good idea for children. If your child needs relief, ask his doctor about treatments that will help. Immunotherapy makes kids less sensitive to their allergy triggers. This treatment comes as a series of shots, or as tablets that go under your child's tongue. Doctors give allergy shots once or twice a week to start and then at longer intervals (every 2 weeks, then once a month). Each shot has a dose of your child's allergy trigger -- like pollen or ragweed -- that gets larger with each shot. After 6 to 12 months on this treatment, children shouldn't react as strongly to their trigger. You can try a few other ways to prevent allergy and asthma symptoms in your child: Dust and vacuum your home often to get rid of dust, pollen, and pet dander. Wash your child's sheets and blankets in hot water at least once a week. Clean up any mold that's collected in damp areas of your home, like the bathroom. If your child is allergic to pollen, keep him indoors with the windows closed on days when the pollen count is high. Get him a flu shot at the start of each fall."
438,"Got a cough? Experts say it's the top reason people see a doctor -- more than 30 million visits a year. Your first step toward relief is to find out the cause. Then consider your symptoms. With that info, you can choose the best treatment. A cough is supposed to protect you. It gets out stuff that doesn't belong in your lungs and windpipe, like inhaled dirt or food. Here are the common triggers. Viruses. Colds and the flu are the most common causes. While annoying, coughs that are âproductiveâ get germy mucus out of your lungs when you're sick. Most will go away in a few days. After a cold, though, some ""dry"" coughs last weeks or months. That could be because coughing irritates your lungs, which leads to more coughing, which irritates your lungs, and so on ... Allergies and asthma . If you have them, inhaling a trigger like mold can cause your lungs to overreact. They're trying to cough out what's bothering them. Irritants. Even if you're not allergic, things like cold air, cigarette smoke, or strong perfumes, can set off a hacking spell. Postnasal drip . When you're congested, mucus drips down from your nose into your throat, and makes you cough. You can get postnasal drip from colds, flu, sinus infections, allergies, and other problems. Acid reflux . When you have heartburn, stomach acids back up into your throat, especially at night. They can irritate your windpipe and make you cough. Other causes. Many other problems -- lung inflammation, sleep apnea, and drug side effects -- can be triggers. Get coughs that won't go away checked out to make sure you don't have a separate problem. That depends on the cause. Options include: Medicines. Over-the-counter cough remedies can help in a number of ways. Suppressants lessen your urge to cough. Expectorants thin mucus and make it easier to hack up. Home remedies. You can drink warm fluids, inhale warm, moist air, and use cough drops. Add a spoonful of honey to hot tea, or choose a cough drop that has it. Never give honey to a child under a year old -- it can make them very sick. Avoid triggers. If you have allergies or asthma, remove allergens from your home. Keep pets out of your bedroom. Use air conditioners to filter air during pollen season. You won't see the effects right away, but if you stay away from what bothers you, you'll start to feel better. Treatment for another problem. Coughs triggered by asthma, acid reflux, sleep apnea, and other medical conditions need special treatment -- often medicine. Talk to your doctor. Time. Common viruses are the most likely causes. Sometimes, the cough can last weeks or months after the virus is gone. Over time your airways will heal and the cough will stop. Most lingering coughs are harmless. But you can't figure out the causes on your own. If your cough isn't getting better after 1 week, it's time to call your doc. See him as soon as you can if your cough interferes with your daily life and ability to work, or if it comes with any of these other symptoms: Trouble breathing Chest pain Ongoing heartburn Coughing up blood Fever or night sweats Trouble sleeping"
439,"Skin cancer is the most common of all human cancers, with 1 million people in the U. S. diagnosed each year with some type of the disease. Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a transformation and grow and multiply without normal controls. Here are the cancer basics: As the cells multiply, they form a mass called a tumor. Tumors are cancerous only if they are malignant. This means that they encroach on and invade neighboring tissues (especially lymph nodes) because of their uncontrolled growth. Tumors may also travel to remote organs via the bloodstream. This process of invading and spreading to other organs is called metastasis. Tumors overwhelm surrounding tissues by invading their space and taking the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive and function. There are three major types of skin cancers: basal cell carcinoma ( BCC), squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC), and melanoma. The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. Other unusual types of skin cancer include Merkel cell tumors and dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans. Here are the basics on skin cancers: The vast majority of skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas. While malignant, these are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. They may be locally disfiguring if not treated early. A small but significant number of skin cancers are malignant melanomas. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that tends to spread to other parts of the body. These cancers may be fatal if not treated early. Like many cancers, skin cancers start as precancerous lesions. These precancerous lesions are changes in skin that are not cancer, but could become cancer over time. Medical professionals often refer to these changes as dysplasia. Some specific dysplastic changes that occur in skin are as follows: Actinic keratosis is an area of red or brown, scaly, rough skin, which can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. A nevus is a mole, and abnormal moles are called dysplastic nevi. These can potentially develop into melanoma over time. Moles are simply growths on the skin that rarely develop into cancer. Most people have 10 to 30 moles on their body that can be identified as flat or raised, smooth on the surface, round or oval in shape, pink, tan, brown or skin-colored, and no larger than a quarter-inch across. If a mole on your body looks different from the others, ask your health care provider to take a look at it. Dysplastic nevi, or abnormal moles, are not cancer, but they can become cancer. People sometimes have as many as 100 or more dysplastic nevi, which are usually irregular in shape, with notched or fading borders. Some may be flat or raised, and the surface may be smooth or rough (""pebbly""). They are often large, at a quarter-inch across or larger, and are typically of mixed color, including pink, red, tan, and brown. Recent studies show the number of skin cancer cases in the U. S. growing at an alarming rate. Fortunately, increased awareness on the part of Americans and their health care providers has resulted in earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. Ultraviolet ( UV) light exposure, most commonly from sunlight, is overwhelmingly the most frequent cause of skin cancer. Other important causes of skin cancer include the following: Use of tanning booths Immunosuppression, or impairment of the immune system, which protects the body from germs or substances that cause an allergic reaction Exposure to unusually high levels of radiation, such as from X-rays Contact with certain chemicals, such as arsenic (miners, sheep shearers, and farmers) and hydrocarbons in tar, oils, and soot (which may cause squamous cell carcinoma) The following people are at the greatest risk of skin cancer: People with fair skin, especially types that freckle, sunburn easily, or become painful in the sun People with light (blond or red) hair and blue or green eyes Those with certain genetic disorders that deplete skin pigment , such as albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum (a disease in which DNA repair mechanisms, especially in response to ultraviolet light, is impaired) People who have already been treated for skin cancer People with numerous moles, unusual moles, or large moles that were present at birth People with close family members who have developed skin cancer People who had at least one severe sunburn early in life People with burns unrelated to sunburn People with indoor occupations and outdoor recreational habits Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are more common in older people. Melanomas are one of the most common cancers in younger people, especially in people ages 25 to 29. The risk of melanoma rises with age. Skin cancer symptoms depend on the type of skin cancer that has developed. A basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) usually looks like a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, or shoulders. Others signs include: Small blood vessels may be visible within the tumor. A central depression with crusting and bleeding (ulceration) frequently develops. A BCC often appears as a sore that does not heal. A squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) is commonly a well-defined, red, scaling, thickened bump on sun-exposed skin. It may ulcerate and bleed, and left untreated, may develop into a large mass. The majority of malignant or cancerous melanomas are brown-to-black pigmented lesions. Other signs of a cancerous melanoma include: A change in size, shape, color, or elevation of a mole The appearance of a new mole during adulthood, or new pain, itching, ulceration, or bleeding of an existing mole The following easy-to-remember guideline, "" ABCDE,"" is useful for identifying malignant melanoma: Asymmetry -- One side of the lesion does not look like the other. Border irregularity -- Margins may be notched or irregular. Color -- Melanomas are often a mixture of black, tan, brown, blue, red, or white. Diameter -- Cancerous lesions can be larger than 6 mm across (about the size of a pencil eraser), although with early detection they will not reach this size. Evolution -- has a mole changed over time? Many people, especially those who have fair coloring or have had extensive sun exposure, periodically check their entire body for suspicious moles and lesions. Have your primary health care provider or a dermatologist check any moles or spots that concern you. See your health care provider to check your skin if you notice any changes in the size, shape, color, or texture of pigmented areas (such as darker or a change in areas of skin or moles). If you have skin cancer, your skin specialist (dermatologist) or cancer specialist (oncologist) will talk to you about symptoms of metastatic disease that might require care in a hospital. If you think a mole or other skin lesion has turned into skin cancer, your primary care provider will probably refer you to a dermatologist. The dermatologist will examine any moles in question and, in many cases, the entire skin surface. Any lesions that are difficult to identify, or are thought to be skin cancer, may then be checked. Tests for skin cancer may include: The doctor may use a handheld device called a dermatoscope to scan the lesion. Another handheld device, Mala Find, scans the lesion then a computer program evaluates images of the lesion to indicate if it's cancerous. A sample of skin (biopsy) will be taken so that the suspicious area of skin can be examined under a microscope. A biopsy is done in the dermatologist's office. If a biopsy shows that you have malignant melanoma, you may undergo further testing to determine the extent of spread of the disease, if any. This may involve blood tests, a chest X-ray, and other tests as needed. This is only needed if the melanoma is of a certain size. Skin cancer treatment for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is straightforward. Usually, surgical removal of the lesion is adequate. Malignant melanoma, however, may require several treatment methods -- depending on the size of the tumor -- including surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Because of the complexity of treatment decisions, people with malignant melanoma may benefit from the combined expertise of the dermatologist, a cancer surgeon, and an oncologist. Home treatment is not appropriate for skin cancer. These conditions require the care of a dermatologist or specialist in skin cancers. Be active in preventing and detecting skin cancer on yourself and others. Perform regular self-examinations of your skin and note any changes. Surgical removal is the mainstay of skin cancer treatment for both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. For more information, see Surgery. People who cannot undergo surgery may be treated by external radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the use of a small beam of radiation targeted at the skin lesion. The radiation kills the abnormal cells and destroys the lesion. Radiation therapy can cause irritation or burning of the surrounding normal skin. It can also cause fatigue. These side effects are temporary. In addition, a topical chemotherapy creams have been FDA approved for the treatment of certain low-risk nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients with advanced or many basal cell carcinomas are sometimes prescribed oral pills to block the growth of these cancers. Side effects include muscle spasms, hair loss, taste changes, weight loss and fatigue. In advanced cases of melanoma, immune therapies, vaccines, or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments are typically offered as clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies of new therapies to see if they can be tolerated and work better than existing therapies. Small skin cancer lesions may be removed through a variety of techniques, including simple excision (cutting it away), electrodesiccation and curettage (scraping the tumor and then burning the tissue with an electric needle), and cryosurgery (freezing the area with liquid nitrogen). Larger tumors, lesions in high-risk locations, recurrent tumors, and lesions in cosmetically sensitive areas are removed by a technique called Mohs micrographic surgery. For this technique, the surgeon carefully removes tissue, layer by layer, until cancer-free tissue is reached. Malignant melanoma is treated more aggressively than just surgical removal. To ensure the complete removal of this dangerous malignancy, 1-2 cm of normal-appearing skin surrounding the tumor is also removed. Depending on the thickness of the melanoma, neighboring lymph nodes may also be removed and tested for cancer. The sentinel lymph node biopsy method uses a mildly radioactive substance to identify which lymph nodes are most likely to be affected. Most skin cancer is cured surgically in the dermatologist's office. Of skin cancers that do recur, most do so within three years. Therefore, follow up with your dermatologist as recommended. Make an appointment immediately if you suspect a problem. If you have advanced malignant melanoma, your oncologist may want to see you every few months. These visits may include total body skin exams, regional lymph node checks, and periodic chest X-rays and body scans. Over time, the intervals between follow-up appointments will increase. Eventually these checks may be done only once a year. You can reduce your risk of getting skin cancer by following these guidelines: Limit sun exposure. Attempt to avoid the sun's intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Apply sunscreen every day. Use a sunscreen with sun protection factor ( SPF) of at least 30 both before and every 60 to 80 minutes during outdoor exposure. Select products that filter both UVA and UVB light. The label will tell you. If you are likely to sunburn, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid artificial tanning booths. Conduct monthly self-exams. Skin Self- Exams Monthly skin self-exams improve your chances of finding a skin cancer early, when it has done a minimum of damage to your skin and can be treated easily. Regular self-exams help you recognize any new or changing features. The best time to do a self-exam is right after a shower or bath. Do the self-exam in a bright room; use a full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror. Learn where your moles, birthmarks, and blemishes are, and what they look like. Each time you do a self-exam, check these areas for changes in size, texture, and color, and for ulceration. If you notice any changes, call your primary care provider or dermatologist. Check all areas of your body, including ""hard-to-reach"" areas. Ask a loved one to help you check if there are areas you can't see. Look in the full-length mirror at your front and your back (use the hand-held mirror to do this). Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows and look carefully at your palms, nails, forearms (front and back), and upper arms. Examine the backs and fronts of your legs. Look at your buttocks (including the area between the buttocks) and your genitals (use the hand-held mirror to make sure you see all skin areas). Sit down and examine your feet carefully, including the nails, soles and between the toes. Look at your scalp, face, and neck. You may use a comb or blow dryer to move your hair while examining your scalp. You may also enlist the help of a friend or family member. Although the number of skin cancers in the U. S. continues to rise, more skin cancers are being caught earlier, when they are easier to treat. Thus, illness and death rates have decreased. When treated properly, the cure rate for both basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) approaches 95%. The remaining cancers recur at some point after treatment. Recurrences of these cancers are almost always local (not spread elsewhere in the body), but they often cause significant tissue destruction. 2% of squamous cell carcinomas will eventually spread elsewhere in the body and turn into dangerous cancer. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually seen in people with compromised immune systems. In most cases, the outcome of malignant melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor at the time of treatment. Thin lesions are almost always cured by simple surgery alone. Thicker tumors, which usually have been present for some time but have gone undetected, may spread to other organs. Surgery removes the tumor and any local spread, but it cannot remove distant metastasis. Other therapies, such as radiation therapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy, are used to treat the metastatic tumors. Malignant melanoma causes more than 75% of deaths from skin cancer. Almost 91,300 people are expected to be diagnosed with melanoma in the U. S. in 2018, and an estimated 12,000 people will die from some form of skin cancer the same year. Living with skin cancer presents many new challenges for you and for your family and friends. You will probably have many worries about how the cancer will affect you and your ability to ""live a normal life,"" that is, to care for your family and home, to hold your job, and to continue the friendships and activities you enjoy. Many people with a skin cancer diagnosis feel anxious and depressed. Some people feel angry and resentful; others feel helpless and defeated. For most people with skin cancer, talking about their feelings and concerns helps. Your friends and family members can be very supportive. They may be hesitant to offer support until they see how you are coping. Don't wait for them to bring it up. If you want to talk about your concerns, let them know. Some people don't want to ""burden"" their loved ones, or prefer talking about their concerns with a more neutral professional. A social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful. Your dermatologist or oncologist should be able to recommend someone. Many people with cancer are profoundly helped by talking to other people who have cancer. Sharing your concerns with others who have been through the same thing can be remarkably reassuring. Support groups for people with cancer may be available through the medical center where you are receiving your treatment.

440,"Doctors may classify lung conditions as obstructive lung disease or restrictive lung disease. Obstructive lung diseases include conditions that make it hard to exhale all the air in the lungs. People with restrictive lung disease have difficulty fully expanding their lungs with air.  Obstructive and restrictive lung disease share the same main symptom: shortness of breath with exertion. People with obstructive lung disease have shortness of breath due to difficulty exhaling all the air from the lungs. Because of damage to the lungs or narrowing of the airways inside the lungs, exhaled air comes out more slowly than normal. At the end of a full exhalation, an abnormally high amount of air may still linger in the lungs. The most common causes of obstructive lung disease are: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis Asthma Bronchiectasis Cystic fibrosis Obstructive lung disease makes it harder to breathe, especially during increased activity or exertion. As the rate of breathing increases, there is less time to breathe all the air out before the next inhalation. People with restrictive lung disease cannot fully fill their lungs with air. Their lungs are restricted from fully expanding. Restrictive lung disease most often results from a condition causing stiffness in the lungs themselves. In other cases, stiffness of the chest wall, weak muscles, or damaged nerves may cause the restriction in lung expansion. Some conditions causing restrictive lung disease are: Interstitial lung disease, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease Obesity, including obesity hypoventilation syndrome Scoliosis Neuromuscular disease, such as muscular dystrophy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) Most commonly, people with obstructive or restrictive lung disease seek a doctor because they feel short of breath. Restrictive and obstructive lung diseases are identified using pulmonary function tests. In pulmonary function testing, a person blows air forcefully through a mouthpiece. As the person performs various breathing maneuvers, a machine records the volume and flow of air through the lungs. Pulmonary function testing can identify the presence of obstructive lung disease or restrictive lung disease, as well as their severity. A doctor's interview (including smoking history), physical exam, and lab tests may provide additional clues to the cause of obstructive lung disease or restrictive lung disease. Imaging tests are almost always part of the diagnosis of restrictive and obstructive lung disease. These may include: Chest X-ray film Computed tomography ( CT scan) of the chest In some people, a bronchoscopy may be recommended to diagnose the lung condition causing obstructive or restrictive lung disease. In a bronchoscopy, a doctor uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera and tools on its tip) to look inside the airways and take samples of lung tissue (biopsies). Obstructive lung disease and restrictive lung disease cause shortness of breath. In early stages of obstructive or restrictive lung disease, shortness of breath occurs only with exertion. If the underlying lung condition progresses, breathlessness may occur with minimal activity, or even at rest. Cough is a common symptom in restrictive and obstructive lung diseases. Usually, the cough is dry or productive of white sputum. People with chronic bronchitis, a form of obstructive lung disease, may cough up larger amounts of colored sputum. Symptoms of depression and anxiety are also common among people with obstructive lung disease and restrictive lung disease. These symptoms occur more often when lung disease causes significant limitations in activity and lifestyle. Obstructive lung disease treatments work by helping to open narrowed airways. Airways may be narrowed by spasms in the smooth muscles that are in the wall of the airways (bronchospasm). Medicines that relax these smooth muscles and improve airflow are called bronchodilators, and are inhaled. These include: Albuterol ( Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, Accu Neb, Pro Air HFA) Ipratropium ( Atrovent) Formoterol ( Foradil) Salmeterol ( Serevent) Tiotropium ( Spiriva) Combined medications like Combivent Respimat, Duo Neb, Anoro Ellipta, and Advair, which include a bronchodilator Theophylline ( Theo- Dur and other brand names) is a rarely used bronchodilator taken as an oral tablet. Inflammation also contributes to airway narrowing in obstructive lung disease. Inflamed airway walls may be swollen and filled with mucus, obstructing airflow. Various medicines help reduce inflammation in obstructive lung disease, including: inhaled corticosteroids ( Flovent, Pulmicort, Advair, QVAR, Alvesco, and others) oral corticosteroids (prednisone and others) montelukast ( Singulair) A program of regular exercise will improve symptoms of breathlessness in virtually all people with obstructive lung disease. Oxygen therapy may be necessary for some people. In severe cases of end-stage, life-threatening obstructive lung disease, lung transplantation can be considered as a treatment option. Few medicines are available to treat most causes of restrictive lung disease. Two drugs, Esbriet (pirfenidone) and Ofev (nintedanib), are FDA-approved to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. They act on multiple pathways that may be involved in the scarring of lung tissue. Studies show both medications slow decline in patients when measured by pulmonary function tests. In cases of restrictive lung disease caused by ongoing inflammation, medicines that suppress the immune system may be used, including: Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Azathioprine ( Imuran) Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate Supplemental oxygen therapy may be necessary. Mechanical breathing assistance may be helpful to some people with breathing difficulty from restrictive lung disease. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( Bi PAP) uses a tight-fitting mask and a pressure generator to assist breathing. Bi PAP is helpful for people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and some nerve or muscle conditions causing restrictive lung disease. In cases of obesity-related lung disease, weight loss and exercise can help reduce the resistance to breathing caused by excess fat. Severe, end-stage restrictive lung disease (such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) may be treated with lung transplantation. Regular exercise improves shortness of breath and quality of life in almost everyone with restrictive lung disease."
441," Arthritis means ""joint inflammation."" It causes pain and swelling in the body's joints, such as the knees or hips. There are many types of arthritis, but osteoarthritis is the most common. Also known as degenerative joint disease or age-related arthritis, osteoarthritis is more likely to develop as people get older. Osteoarthritis occurs when inflammation and injury to a joint cause a breaking down of cartilage tissue. In turn, that breakdown causes pain, swelling, and deformity. Cartilage is a firm, rubbery material that covers the ends of bones in normal joints. It is primarily made up of water and proteins. The primary function of cartilage is to reduce friction in the joints and serve as a ""shock absorber."" The shock-absorbing quality of normal cartilage comes from its ability to change shape when compressed. It can do this because of its high water content. Although cartilage may undergo some repair when damaged, the body does not grow new cartilage after it is injured. The changes in osteoarthritis usually occur slowly over many years. There are, though, occasional exceptions. The two main types of osteoarthritis are: Primary: More generalized osteoarthritis that affects the fingers, thumbs, spine, hips, and knees Secondary: Osteoarthritis that occurs after injury or inflammation in a joint, or as a result of another condition that may affect the composition of the cartilage, such as hemochromatosis Patients who have osteoarthritis of the hip sometimes have problems walking. Diagnosis can be difficult at first. That's because pain can appear in different locations, including the groin, thigh, buttocks, or knee. The pain can be stabbing and sharp or it can be a dull ache, and the hip is often stiff. The causes of osteoarthritis of the hip are not known. Factors that may contribute include joint injury, increasing age, and being overweight. In addition, osteoarthritis can sometimes be caused by other factors: The joints may not have formed properly. There may be genetic (inherited) defects in the cartilage. The person may be putting extra stress on his or her joints, either by being overweight or through activities that involve the hip. If you have any of the following symptoms of hip osteoarthritis, talk to your doctor: Joint stiffness that occurs as you are getting out of bed Joint stiffness after you sit for a long time Any pain, swelling, or tenderness in the hip joint A sound or feeling (""crunching"") of bone rubbing against bone Inability to move the hip to perform routine activities such as putting on your socks There is no single test for diagnosing osteoarthritis, but often it is diagnosed by an abnormal X-ray that shows characteristic features such as narrowing of the joint and spurring of the joint margins. Your doctor will take your medical history and perform a physical examination. This will include a check of how your hip is functioning and may uncover loss of motion. The main goal of treating osteoarthritis of the hip is to improve the person's mobility (ability to get around) and lifestyle. Part of this goal involves improving the function of the hip and controlling pain. Treatment plans can involve: Rest and joint care Use of a cane to take weight off the affected hip Nondrug pain relief techniques to control pain Losing excess weight Exercise Medications, including acetaminophen ( Tylenol), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen ( Advil), or a prescription pain medication Surgery Complementary and alternative therapies The hip joint is a ball-and-socket mechanism. The ball is located at the top of the thigh bone (femur). Total hip replacement surgery replaces the damaged ball with a metal ball. The hip socket is resurfaced using a metal shell and a plastic liner. Hip resurfacing is a surgical option that can provide relief while delaying hip replacement surgery. In hip resurfacing, the diseased hip joint surfaces are removed surgically and substituted with metal. However, the entire femur bone is preserved. That makes future hip replacement surgeries possible. Rather than removing the ball of the hip socket, the surgeon covers it with a metal cap. One method for preventing osteoarthritis of the hip is to maintain a healthy weight. In addition, you should exercise. Exercise strengthens muscles around joints. Such strengthening can help prevent wear and tear on cartilage in a joint. Your health care provider may be able to offer additional suggestions to minimize your risk for hip osteoarthritis."
442,"People use the words âsprainâ and âstrainâ almost interchangeably, to describe everything from a twisted ankle to a pulled hamstring. But they're not the same.  A sprain is a stretch or tear in a ligament. Ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to bones at joints. A strain is also a stretch or tear, but it happens in a muscle or a tendon. Tendons link muscles to the bones. Sprains usually happen when a person falls, twists, or is hit in a way that forces the body out of its normal position. The most common type of sprain is a sprained ankle. About 25,000 people sprain an ankle every day. Think of a runner who goes over a curb and catches her foot, twisting the ankle; or a baseball player who slides into a base and twists his knee. Wrist and thumb sprains are also common, particularly in sports like skiing, where it's not unusual to fall and land on an outstretched palm. Athletes in contact sports, like football, hockey, and boxing, have the biggest chance of strains. Even in noncontact sports like tennis, golf, or rowing, doing the same motions over and over can lead to strains of the hand and forearm. These injuries can happen when you work out at the gym, or they can happen at home or the workplace, especially if you do a lot of heavy lifting. The signs of most sprains or strains are very similar: pain and inflammation, and sometimes bruising, at the injured area. Depending on how bad the sprain or strain is, the pain may be mild, moderate, or severe. The worse the sprain or strain, the harder it is to use the affected area. Someone with a mild ankle sprain may just favor that ankle slightly. A more severe ankle sprain may cause much more pain and make it tough or impossible to walk. If you have a sprain, your doctor may mention its âgradeâ: Grade I is stretching of the ligament or a very mild tear, with little or no instability at the joint. Grade II is a more serious but still incomplete tear, with some looseness in the joint. Grade III is a completely torn or ruptured ligament. This is not a broken bone, but can feel like one since it's often impossible to put weight on the joint or use the affected limb because the joint isn't stable. Most people with mild sprains and strains can treat these injuries at home by following â RICEâ therapy (see below). For more severe cases, see a doctor, who may do X-rays to check that you don't have a fracture. You may also get an MRI to check on your ligaments. Even if you don't have a fracture, you may need other treatment, such as an ankle cast and/or crutches for a severe ankle sprain. In some cases, you may need surgery to repair the torn ligament or tendon. Physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises often help, too. Although the degree of pain and swelling are usually the best indicators of how severe a sprain or strain is, this is not always the case. Some injuries, like Achilles tendon tears, may cause only mild pain at first, but are actually more severe. See a doctor right away if any of these things happen: The pain and swelling don't start to ease within 24 to 72 hours. You cannot bear weight. Your symptoms get worse. The gold standard of care for sprains and strains is known as â RICEâ therapy. It stands for: Rest: Don't put weight on the injured area for 24 to 48 hours. This includes not lifting with an affected wrist or elbow. If you physically cannot put weight on an injured knee or ankle, see your doctor. Ice: Put a bag of ice on the injured area for 10 minutes at a time, and then take it off for at least 30 minutes over the course of the first 3 days. Wrap the ice in a damp cloth or put it in a plastic bag. ( Don't put ice directly on your skin). The cold constricts blood vessels and slows down the inflammatory process, which eases pain and swelling. But using ice for too long at a time can cause injury, so take breaks. Compression: You can either wrap an injured wrist, ankle, knee, or elbow in an elastic bandage, or buy a compression sleeve. Like ice, compression helps to keep the swelling down. Elevation: Lie down and place the injured area on a pillow, and raise it above the level of your heart. This will keep fluid from collecting in the area, so you don't have as much swelling. RICE therapy is particularly important during the first 24 to 72 hours after a sprain or strain happens. During this time, you can also take medication to curb pain. Check with your doctor to see what medicine is OK for you, and follow the instructions on the label exactly. If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. As your pain and swelling gets better, you can cut down on RICE therapy and start to use the affected area again. You'll need ice and compression less often, such as at the end of the day, as swelling and pain tend to flare up after use. You probably can't wait to get active again, but you shouldn't rush it. You could reinjure the area and make it worse. On the other hand, you shouldn't rest the injured area too long, or scar tissue could limit what you can do. It's best to rehab your injury gradually. Your doctor or a physical therapist can recommend certain exercises that can help you get back to your normal routine bit by bit, at a safe pace. For example, if you've sprained your ankle, you may begin by walking slowly on a flat treadmill, then move to an incline, then begin to jog. Someone with a sprained wrist may begin with range-of-motion exercises, and then move on to lifting very light weights. You can expect some discomfort during rehabilitation. But a sudden flare-up of severe pain is a signal to take a step back and move more cautiously. Talk to your doctor if this happens. The time frame for recovery depends on the severity of the injury and can vary from person to person. It may take just a few days for a slight sprain of an ankle to heal, or it may take months for a knee that needs surgery to reconstruct it. For most mild to moderate sprains and strains, you can expect to regain full mobility within 3 to 8 weeks. More severe injuries can take months for a full recovery. You should have an understanding before you leave your doctor's office or hospital about what you need to do to recover. Make sure you have answers to these questions: What is my injury? What's OK for me to do? What activities should I avoid? What can I safely take for pain and how often? How long will my recovery take? What can I expect during that time? When is it safe to return to full activity? When do I need to get my injury re-evaluated?"
443,"Print out these questions and answers to discuss with your doctor. Although research is ongoing, to date there is no known cure or way to prevent Parkinson's disease. Still, research in Parkinson's disease has made remarkable progress. There is very real hope that the causes, whether genetic or environmental, will be identified and the precise effects of these causes on brain function will be understood. These remarkable achievements give real hope for the future. Even though there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, by identifying individual symptoms and determining a proper course of treatment, most people with the disease can live enjoyable, fulfilling lives. Parkinson's disease is caused by the progressive impairment or deterioration of neurons (nerve cells) in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. When functioning normally, these neurons produce a vital brain chemical known as dopamine. Dopamine serves as a chemical messenger allowing communication between the substantia nigra and another area of the brain called the basal ganglia. This communication coordinates smooth and balanced muscle movement. A lack of dopamine results in abnormal nerve functioning, causing a loss in the ability to control body movements. To date, there is no known way to prevent Parkinson's disease. But, there are several treatment options, including drug therapy and/or surgery that can reduce the symptoms, and make living with the disease easier. The most common cause of tremor (involuntary shaking) is a condition called essential tremor. Both essential tremor ( ET) and Parkinson's disease ( PD) are movement disorders. A movement disorder can be defined as any disease or injury that interferes with an individual's movement. ET and PD are different conditions but are sometimes associated because they share many features. Essential tremor is a disease of the body's system of nerves characterized by tremors. Areas affected most often include the hands, arms, head, and sometimes the voice. Essential tremor does not affect life expectancy, but it can become disabling for many common activities, such as writing and eating. ET also does not increase the risk for Parkinson's disease. Symptoms of essential tremor include: Involuntary tremors that occur for brief periods of time A shaking voice Nodding head Tremors that worsen during periods of emotional stress Tremors that get worse with purposeful movement Tremor lessens with rest Tremors are the only symptom Difficulty with balance (rare) Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive brain and nerve disease that affects a small area of nerve cells (neurons) in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. These cells normally produce dopamine, a chemical (neurotransmitter) that transmits signals between areas in the brain. These signals, when working normally, coordinate smooth and balanced muscle movement. Parkinson's disease however, causes the neurons in the substantia nigra to die, leading to a lack of dopamine in the brain. The loss of dopamine leads to a loss of the ability to control body movements normally. Symptoms of Parkinson's include: Muscle rigidity Tremors Bradykinesia (the slowing down of movement and the gradual loss of spontaneous activity) Changes in walking pattern and posture Changes in speech and handwriting Loss of balance and increased falls Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing, resulting in lightheadedness or fainting) There are many important issues to be addressed when considering deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's disease. These issues should be discussed with a movement disorders expert or a specially trained neurologist. A movement disorders expert is someone who has trained specifically in movement disorders. One of the most important criteria is that you try drug treatment first. Surgery is not recommended if medications can adequately control the disease. However, surgery should be considered if you do not achieve satisfactory control with medications. Talk to your doctor to see if deep brain stimulation is right for you. The most important step you can take is to seek help as soon as you feel less able to cope with Parkinson's disease. Taking action early will enable you to understand and deal with the many effects of your condition. A mental health care provider can design a treatment plan to meet your specific needs. Strategies can be designed to help you regain a sense of control over your life and improve your quality of life. Other steps you can take include the following. Find out as much as you can about the illness. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don't isolate them. They will want to be involved in helping you. Do things you enjoy. Do not be afraid to ask your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider to repeat any instructions or medical terms that you don't understand or remember. They should always be available to answer your questions and address your concerns. Make use of resources and support services offered by your hospital and in your community. Learn to manage stress. This will help you to maintain a positive physical, emotional, and spiritual outlook on life. Being stressed out will only make the situation worse. You should try to organize a daily routine that will reduce stress, with down time for both you and your family members. If you are depressed -- and this is more than just feeling sad occasionally -- antidepressants can be prescribed to help lift your mood. Guided imagery is a proven form of focused relaxation that helps create harmony between the mind and body. Guided imagery coaches you in creating calm, peaceful images in your mind -- a ""mental escape."" This technique, which can aid any treatment or procedure, provides a powerful psychological strategy that enhances a person's coping skills. Many people dealing with stress feel loss of control, fear, panic, anxiety, helplessness, and uncertainty. Research has shown that guided imagery can dramatically counteract these effects. It can help people overcome stress, anger, pain, depression, insomnia, and other problems often associated with illnesses and medical/surgical procedures. It is clear that stress and depression can worsen the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. By using guided imagery, you can stay calm. If you have trouble with ""freezing"" in place: Rock from foot to foot to get moving again. Have someone place their foot in front of you, or visualize something you need to step over, to get moving again."
444,"If you're looking for a simple way to ease chronic constipation, drink plenty of fluids every day. Staying well-hydrated can be a key part of your plan to ""get things moving"" again. Water is important for your digestion. It keeps the food you eat moving through your intestines, and it keeps your intestines smooth and flexible, too. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of chronic constipation. The food you eat makes its way from your stomach to the large intestine, or colon. If you don't have enough water in your body already, the large intestine soaks up water from your food waste. This makes you have hard stools that are difficult to pass. There are other causes of chronic constipation too, including what you eat, traveling, medicines, irritable bowel syndrome, and pregnancy. Watch the amount of fluid you drink, listen to your body, and drink more liquids during exercise and hot weather. You get dehydrated when your body gets rid of more fluids -- usually through sweating or going to the bathroom more than normal -- than it takes in. Drinking too little water during exercise, hot weather, or daily activities can also cause your body to use up its stored water. Extra fluids help keep the stool soft and easy to pass, but drinking more liquids does not cure constipation. When it comes to thirst, most experts say you should let your body be your guide. The Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board suggests that women get 91 ounces of water each day from foods and drinks and men should get 125 ounces. Remember, this recommendation includes the fluids that you take in from your food. In general, for healthy, average people, 8 cups a day is a good goal. Talk to your doctor about how much water is good for you. People with some medical conditions may need to drink less than that. Others may need more than 8 cups a day. Fruit and vegetable juices, clear soups, and herbal teas are also good sources of fluids. Stay away from alcohol. It is a diuretic, which gets rid of water from your body and leads to dehydration. Caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and colas are also diuretics, but as long as you drink moderate amounts, they probably won't cause dehydration."
445,"If you've just been diagnosed with hepatitis C, you may wonder how you got it and worry about passing on the virus to a loved one. If you've had the disease for a long time without knowing it, you could dwell on every little incident in the past where you might have accidentally exposed a family member to the disease. It's important to remember that hepatitis C isn't easy to catch. If you take a few precautions, it's almost impossible to pass on the disease to someone else. Hepatitis C is spread only through exposure to an infected person's blood. High-risk activities include: Sharing drug use equipment. Anything involved with injecting street drugs, from syringes, to needles, to tourniquets, can have small amounts of blood on it that can transmit hepatitis C. Pipes and straws to smoke or snort drugs can have blood on them from cracked lips or nosebleeds. Get into a treatment program if you can. At the very least, don't share needles or equipment with anyone else. Sharing tattoo or piercing tools. Nonsterile items and ink can spread contaminated blood. Blood transfusions in countries that don't screen blood for hepatitis C. Nonsterile medical equipment. Tools that aren't cleaned properly between use can spread the virus. Blood or cutting rituals. Sharing the tools or exchanging blood can transmit hepatitis C. Medium-risk activities include: Sharing or not disposing of grooming and hygiene supplies. This includes razors, toothbrushes, nail clippers, or anything else that could have your blood on it. Cover any open wounds or sores with bandages. Carefully dispose of tampons, sanitary napkins, tissues, used bandages, and anything else that might have your blood on it. Unprotected sex. It's rare, but you can spread and catch it from sex, especially during menstruation or certain sex practices like fisting. It's more likely you'll spread it if you have HIV or another sexually transmitted infection. Pregnancy and birth. There's a small risk for a mother to pass the disease on to her child before or during birth. The odds go up if the mother has HIV. Needle-stick injuries. Health care workers and caregivers are most likely to get it this way. It cannot be spread through: Coughing Sneezing Hugging Kissing Breastfeeding (unless nipples are cracked or bleeding) Sharing utensils or glasses Casual contact Sharing food and water Mosquito or other insect bites That means everyday contact isn't risky. The odds of it spreading between people in a household are near zero. Hepatitis C can spread through sexual intercourse, but it's rare. And it's extremely rare among monogamous couples. In fact, the CDC considers the risk of sexual transmission between monogamous couples so low that it doesn't even recommend using condoms. Also, there's no evidence that hepatitis C is spread by oral sex. But you should avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes, and nail clippers, and sex during menstruation. If you have HIV or if you have multiple partners, you should take precautions. Using condoms will protect you and your partners. You might be more likely to get it if you: Inject or have injected street drugs (even once) Were born between 1945 and 1965 Got clotting factor concentrates made before 1987 Received a blood transfusion or solid organ transplants before July 1992 Got blood or organs from a donor who tested positive for hepatitis C Are on dialysis Are a health care worker who might be exposed to needle sticks Have an HIV infection Were born to an infected mother Are in jail or prison Use intranasal drugs Get a body piercing or tattoo with nonsterile instruments Yes. If you've been infected and cleared the virus, or you've been treated and cured, you can get the virus again. You can't give blood if you currently have symptoms or have ever tested positive for hepatitis C. But you can probably donate organs or tissue, since risk of transmission is low and hepatitis C is curable. While the odds of passing on the hepatitis C virus are low, you should still tell anyone at risk that you have hepatitis C. You should tell sexual partners, spouses, and family members. Your infection may be difficult to discuss, but anyone at potential risk must know. That way, they can get tested and treated if needed."
446,"When allergies strike, nasal sprays can help. There are many different types, and most work faster than pills. You can buy them at the drugstore, or your doctor can prescribe one to relieve a stuffy or runny nose. Decongestant sprays shrink swollen blood vessels and tissues in your nose that cause congestion. Oxymetazoline hydrochloride ( Afrin, Dristan, Sinex) and phenylephrine hydrochloride ( Neo- Synephrine) are some examples of these medicines. You can buy them over the counter. Don't use decongestant nasal sprays longer than three days. Using them longer can actually make your nose more stopped up. Ask your doctor before using them if you have glaucoma or high blood pressure that's not under control. Antihistamine sprays relieve congestion, itchy and runny nose, and sneezing. They are available by prescription and include azelastine ( Astelin, Astepro) and olopatadine ( Patanase). They usually cause less drowsiness than antihistamine pills, but they still may make some people sleepy. These sprays work very well to reduce congestion, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. They also help stop a drippy nose. They're often the first drug recommended for allergies, but it takes about a week before you'll notice your symptoms getting better. Examples of steroid nasal sprays available by prescription include beclomethasone ( Beconase, Qnasl), ciclesonide ( Zetonna), fluticasone furoate ( Veramyst), and mometasone ( Nasonex). Three medications can be purchased over the counter -- budesonide ( Rhinocort Allergy), fluticasone ( Flonase Allergy Relief), and triamcinolone ( Nasacort Allergy 24 HR). Side effects can include headache, sore throat, nosebleed, or cough. This nasal spray prevents your body from releasing histamines, chemicals that cause allergy symptoms like runny nose and sneezing. It can also help a stuffy nose. Some people see results in only 30 minutes. For it to work best, you need to start using it one to two weeks before allergy season starts and then use it one or more times every day. It doesn't work as well as steroid nasal sprays. You can buy Nasal Crom as a nasal spray at the drugstore. Cromolyn sodium is safe for most people. Ask your doctor before using it if you have wheezing from asthma or sinus pain. Side effects can include sneezing and nasal burning. This prescription nasal spray treats a runny nose by stopping the production of mucus. It doesn't relieve congestion or sneezing very well. If you have glaucoma or an enlarged prostate, you may not be able to use Atrovent. Side effects can include headache, nosebleeds, sore throat, or nasal irritation."
447,"Almost always, your skin will itch before a rash appears in eczema. Typically, eczema shows itself as: Patches of chronically itchy, dry, thickened skin, usually on the hands, neck, face, and legs (but it can occur anywhere). In children, the inner creases of the knees and elbows are often involved. If scratched, dry patches of skin and open sores with crusts may develop and may get infected. You develop an itchy rash and have a family history of eczema or asthma. The inflammation doesn't respond within a week to treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams. You may need more aggressive forms of treatment. You develop yellowish to light brown crust or pus-filled blisters over existing patches of eczema. This may indicate a bacterial infection that should be treated with an antibiotic. During a flare-up of eczema, you are exposed to anyone with a viral skin disease such as cold sores or genital herpes. Having eczema puts you at increased risk of contracting the herpes simplex virus. You develop numerous painful, small, fluid-filled blisters in the areas of eczema. You may have eczema herpeticum, a rare but potentially serious complication caused by the herpes simplex virus."
448,"If you have type 2 diabetes and take multiple insulin shots, you may want to ask your doctor about the insulin pump. Insulin pumps are small, computerized devices (about the size of a small cell phone) that allow for a continuous flow of a rapid-acting insulin to be released into your body. The pumps have a small, flexible tube (called a catheter) with a fine needle on the end, which is inserted under the skin of your abdomen and taped in place. The devices can be worn on a belt or placed in a pocket. The insulin pump is designed to deliver a continuous amount of insulin, 24 hours a day according to a programmed plan unique to each pump wearer. The user can change the amount of insulin delivered. Between meals and overnights, a small amount of insulin is constantly delivered to keep the blood sugar in the target range. This is called the basal rate. When food is eaten, a bolus dose of insulin can be programmed into the pump. You can measure how much of a bolus you need using calculations based on the grams of carbohydrates consumed. When using an insulin pump, you must monitor your blood glucose level at least four times a day. You set the doses of your insulin and make adjustments to the dose depending on your food intake and exercise program. Some health care providers prefer the insulin pump for diabetes because its slow release of insulin mimics how a normally working pancreas would release insulin. One large study concluded the insulin pump is a safe and valuable treatment option for those with poorly controlled blood sugar. Another advantage of the insulin pump is that it frees you from having to measure insulin into a syringe."
449,"Malignant hypertension is extremely high blood pressure that develops rapidly and causes some type of organ damage. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80. A person with malignant hypertension has a blood pressure that's typically above 180/120. Malignant hypertension should be treated as a medical emergency. In many people, high blood pressure is the main cause of malignant hypertension. Missing doses of blood pressure medications can also cause it. In addition, there are certain medical conditions that can cause it. They include: Collagen vascular disease, such as scleroderma Kidney disease Spinal cord injuries Tumor of the adrenal gland Use of certain medications, including birth control pills and MAOIs Use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine Malignant hypertension is rare. About 1% of people who have a history of high blood pressure develop this life-threatening condition. You are at greater risk of developing it if you are a man, African- American, or someone of lower economic status. Poor access to health care increases the risk. The main symptoms of malignant hypertension are a rapidly increasing blood pressure of 180/120 or higher and signs of organ damage. Usually, the damage happens to the kidneys or the eyes. Other symptoms depend on how the rise in blood pressure affects your organs. A common symptom is bleeding and swelling in the tiny blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the layer of nerves that line the back of the eye. It senses light and sends signals to the brain through the optic nerve, which can also be affected by malignant hypertension. When the eye is involved, malignant hypertension can cause changes in vision. Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include: Blurred vision Chest pain (angina) Difficulty breathing Dizziness Numbness in the arms, legs, and face Severe headache Shortness of breath In rare cases, malignant hypertension can cause brain swelling, which leads to a dangerous condition called hypertensive encephalopathy. Symptoms include: Blindness Changes in mental status Coma Confusion Drowsiness Headache that continues to get worse Nausea and vomiting Seizures High blood pressure, in general, makes it difficult for kidneys to filter wastes and toxins from the blood. It is a leading cause of kidney failure. Malignant hypertension can cause your kidneys to suddenly stop working properly. A diagnosis of malignant hypertension is based on blood pressure readings and signs of acute organ damage. If you have symptoms of malignant hypertension, the doctor will: Recheck your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs for abnormal sounds Examine your eyes to check for damage to the blood vessels of the retina and swelling of the optic nerve Order blood and urine tests that may include: Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) and creatinine levels, which increase if you have kidney damage Blood clotting tests Blood sugar (glucose) level Complete blood count Sodium and potassium levels Urinalysis to check for blood, protein, or abnormal hormone levels related to kidney problems Additional blood tests may be needed, depending on the result of the tests listed above. The doctor will also ask for imaging tests, including: Echocardiogram to check heart function and blood flow through the heart Electrocardiogram ( ECG) to check the heart's electrical function Chest X-ray to look at the shape and size of the heart structures and to detect fluid in the lungs Other imaging tests to evaluate the kidneys and their arteries Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital, often in an intensive care unit. The doctor will consider your symptoms and overall health when deciding what treatment plan is best for you. The goal of treatment is to carefully lower your blood pressure within a matter of minutes. You will receive blood pressure medicines through an IV, which is the quickest way to treat extremely high blood pressure. Once blood pressure is at a safe level, the medications may be switched to oral forms. If you develop kidney failure, you may need kidney dialysis. Other treatments depend on your specific symptoms and possible causes of the malignant hypertension. Untreated, malignant hypertension causes death. Complications of malignant hypertension also may include: Aortic dissection, which is a sudden rupture of the main blood vessel leaving the heart Coma Fluid in the lungs, called pulmonary edema Heart attack Heart failure Stroke Sudden kidney failure Immediate medical treatment decreases your chances for life-threatening complications."
450,"If someone you love has schizophrenia, knowing when to call the doctor isn't always easy -- and you can't always rely on your loved one to let you know he needs help. During a psychotic episode, he may not know the difference between what's real and what isn't. He could see and hear things that aren't there (hallucinations) or believe something is controlling his thoughts (delusions). He might even think that you're plotting against him. This can be scary and upsetting. But stay calm, trust your intuition, and remember that professional help is within reach. Most of the time your loved one won't suddenly lose complete control of himself. You'll probably notice signs leading up to a psychotic episode. Symptoms vary, but there are some common ones, including: Mistrustful or suspicious beliefs or ideas Unexpected outbursts Isolation from friends and family Noticeable mood changes Trouble sleeping Bizarre behavior Call your doctor for advice if your loved one's mood changes or his thinking seems unusual. If he's stopped taking his medication, but doesn't seem like he's going to hurt you or anyone else, encourage him to visit the doctor with you. If you're afraid help from your doctor isn't going to be fast enough, you may need call to 911. To decide when you should call for help, ask yourself these questions: Is your loved one threatening to harm himself or someone else, including you? Has he ever attempted suicide before? Is he unable to feed or dress himself? Is he living on the streets? If you answered âyesâ to any of these, call 911 or a local emergency number. Don't try to solve the situation on your own or put yourself at risk. If you think there's any chance that he will try to commit suicide, ask someone to stay with him while you call for emergency help. Most people with schizophrenia are not violent. But just like you would in any other situation, if you're scared for your safety, immediately call 911 and ask the dispatcher for the police. Tell them that your loved one is psychotic, and explain you need help controlling his behavior and getting him medical treatment. Ask the police not to show any weapons when they arrive so they don't alarm him more. If possible, someone should stay with you while you wait. And you should also call his doctor right away. No matter what, remember that you and your loved one deserve to get the help you need quickly, so you can get back on track with his wellness plan."
451,"With this condition, also known as crossed eyes or walleyes, your eyes aren't always aligned. That means they don't work together to look at an object. One may look in or out, or turn up or down. It can happen all the time or only when you're stressed out or sick. Some children are born with it. Your child's doctor will call this congenital strabismus. Many times, there's no clear cause. There may be a problem with the part of his nervous system that controls eye muscles. Or he could have a tumor or eye disorder. If it doesn't appear until later in life, it will cause double vision. If an adult's eyes cross without warning, he could have a serious condition like a stroke. If either one happens, see a doctor immediately. Young children can suppress vision in a weaker eye, which lets them avoid double vision. However, that may lead to ""lazy eye,"" a condition your doctor will refer to as amblyopia. Depth perception and peripheral vision (vision off to the side) may be affected. It can cause eyestrain and headaches. If your eyes cross when you're older, you may start to turn your head to see in certain directions and avoid double vision. Start treatment as soon as you can. If you don't, the condition could continue into adulthood. Most adults with crossed eyes were born that way. Talk to a pediatric ophthalmologist, an eye doctor who specializes in working with kids. He may start treatment with eyeglasses or a patch to force your child to use the off-kilter eye until he sees normally. Sometimes, farsightedness is to blame. Glasses may solve the problem. The main goal is to get the problem eye working like it should before your child turns 8 years old. After that, permanent vision loss can set in. Yes. It affects the muscles that move your child's eye. It works best when done during childhood, but adults can have it, too The surgeon opens the eyeball's outer layer to reach a muscle. To strengthen the muscle, the surgeon removes a small section from one end and reattaches at the same location. This makes the muscle shorter, which turns the eye toward that side. To weaken a muscle, the doctor moves it back or makes a partial cut across it. The eye turns away from that side. Any double vision after surgery should go away within a few weeks as the brain adjusts to improved sight."
452,"There are a lot of ways to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML) that can help bring your disease under control. To find the best one for you, you'll work closely with a specialist called a hematologist-oncologist, a doctor with special training in blood diseases such as leukemia. The goal is to destroy cells that contain the BCR- ABL gene, which leads to too many abnormal white blood cells. Your doctor will decide on a treatment plan based on the stage of your disease. He'll likely start you off with a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI). It blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase, which is made by the BCR- ABL gene and plays a role in the growth of abnormal blood cells. Your doctor will likely prescribe a TKI such as: Bosutinib ( Bosulif) Dasatinib ( Sprycel) Imatinib ( Gleevec) Nilotinib ( Tasigna) Ponatinib ( Iclusig) Most people get a quick response from these drugs. Your doctor will likely know in 3 to 6 months if your treatment works. You may go into ""remission"" while you take a TKI. That means that the abnormal gene is no longer in your cells. It doesn't mean that you're cured, but your CML is now under control. Always tell your doctor about any new symptoms. Some side effects that you might have from a TKI are: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Rash Headache Fatigue Lower blood cell counts Your doctor will set several goals to help him check if your treatment is doing its job. For instance, he'll look to see that you have: Normal blood cell counts with no signs of abnormal white blood cells, called a complete hematologic response. No blood or bone marrow cells that contain the "" Philadelphia"" chromosome, which creates the BCR- ABL gene. This is called a complete cytogenetic response. No sign of BCR- ABL in your blood, also called a complete molecular response. While you take TKIs, you'll get regular blood tests, including: Complete blood counts to check white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets Blood cell exams to check the percentage of abnormal blood cells Cytogenetic analysis, which looks for the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) tests to check for the BCR- ABL gene A typical schedule for testing may look something like this: During the first 3 months, you'll likely have a complete round of blood tests every 2 weeks. At 3 months, you may get a follow-up bone marrow study. After the third month, you'll have blood and bone marrow tests at least once every 6 months until you have a complete cytogenetic response. Once you have a complete cytogenetic and molecular response, you'll get a PCR test every 3-6 months and a cytogenetic analysis once every year. If your CML doesn't slow down after you are treated with two or more TKIs, your doctor may switch you to another drug such as omacetaxine mepesuccinate ( Synribo). It helps stop the growth of cancer cells. You get it as an injection. You've got some other options: Immunotherapy. It helps your immune system, your body's defense against germs, destroy the cancer. One example is a drug called interferon, which you take as an injection every day. Chemotherapy. It kills the abnormal cells in your body, but it doesn't work as well for CML as other types of leukemia. It's usually used if you're in the ""blast"" phase of the disease, a period when infections and bleeding are common and can be life-threatening. Allogeneic stem cell transplant. It's the only potential cure. The procedure is usually done if you're young and don't have any medical issues besides CML. It replaces abnormal white blood cells with stem cells you get from a donor and lets your body make healthy blood cells. But there are serious risks, including a disease called GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). When this happens, the new stem cells attack your normal cells by mistake. If other treatments don't work, an experimental drug may be an option. Researchers test new therapies in clinical trials, which could give you access to cutting-edge treatment not yet available to the general public. To find out more, talk to your doctor."
453," Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a type of mental illness. People with OCD can have either obsessive thoughts and urges or compulsive, repetitive behaviors. Some have both obsessions and compulsions. OCD isn't about habits like biting your nails or always thinking negative thoughts. The disorder can affect your job, school, and relationships and keep you from living a normal life. Your thoughts and actions are beyond your control. An obsessive thought, for example, is to think that your family members might get hurt if they don't put their clothing on in the exact same order every morning. A compulsive habit, on the other hand, might be to wash your hands 7 times after touching something that might be dirty. Although you may not want to think or do these things, you feel powerless to stop. Many people with OCD know that their thoughts and habits don't make sense. They don't do them because they enjoy them, but because they can't quit. And if they do stop, they feel so bad that they start again. Obsessions and compulsions can involve many different things, like a need for order or cleanness, hoarding, and intrusive thoughts about sex, religion, violence, and body parts. Obsessive thoughts can include: Fear of germs or getting dirty Worries about getting hurt or others being hurt Need for things to be placed in an exact order Belief that certain numbers or colors are âgoodâ or âbadâ Constant awareness of blinking, breathing, or other body sensations Unfounded suspicion that a partner is unfaithful Compulsive habits can include: Washing hands many times in a row Doing tasks in a specific order every time, or a certain âgoodâ number of times Repetitive checking on a locked door, light switch, and other things Need to count things, like steps or bottles Putting items in an exact order, like cans with labels facing front Fear of touching doorknobs, using public toilets, or shaking hands Doctors aren't sure why some people have OCD. Certain areas in the brain may not look normal in people with OCD, but more research is needed. OCD is slightly more common in women than in men. Symptoms often appear in teens or young adults. Stress can make symptoms worse. There may be a gene or genes linked to OCD, but this is still unknown. You are more likely to get the disorder if you have: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Depression, anxiety or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Your doctor may do a physical exam and bloodwork to make sure that your symptoms aren't caused by something else. She will also talk with you about your feelings, thoughts, and habits. If your thoughts and habits keep you from doing what you want to do for at least an hour a day, you may have OCD. There's no cure for OCD. But with treatments, you may be able to lessen how much your symptoms interfere with your life. Your doctor may prescribe medicine, send you to talk therapy, called psychotherapy, or both."
454,"Recovery from hip replacement surgery can be a long process. What should you expect? Everyone's case is different, but here's a rough outline of what will happen after hip replacement surgery -- from the day of the operation to three months later. Day of Your Hip Replacement Surgery You'll check in several hours before your scheduled surgery. Expect to stay for 3 to 4 days. The procedure will probably last about 2 to 3 hours. Recovery from anesthesia will probably take about 2 hours. Once you're fully awake, you'll go to your hospital room. You will likely stick to a liquid diet for the rest of the day. You will need medication to help with pain and to prevent infection and blood clots. 1 to 2 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery You'll get out of bed -- with assistance -- and start moving around using a walker or crutches. You will see physical and occupational therapists. They will help you learn how to move safely with minimal pain. You probably won't be able to do certain movements for a few weeks. The day after surgery, you can usually begin eating a normal diet. You'll see many different people from the hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, and case workers. You'll likely shift from intravenous ( IV) to oral pain medications. 3 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery Walking will likely be easier. You may be able to walk to the bathroom without help. You will be discharged from the hospital if you are doing well. Some people stay longer if they have complications. Depending on your situation, you may go straight home or to a rehab facility, where you'll recover. 4+ Days After Hip Replacement Surgery Follow your doctor's instructions for taking care of your incision. Keep the area dry and stick to sponge baths to prevent infection. Do not let your incision get wet, like in a tub. Report any signs of infection -- such as increased redness, drainage from the incision, or fever -- to your doctor right away. Keep doing the suggested physical therapy exercises. You may get home visits from nurses and the physical therapist. You should need less pain medication. Move about as much as possible. This will help maintain good blood flow in your legs and help prevent blood clots. 10 to 14 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery The staples from your incision will be removed. At this point, you can start taking baths or showers. 3 to 6 Weeks After Hip Replacement Surgery You may be able to do most light activities. You'll likely be able to walk without a walker or crutches. You may be able to drive again 10 to 12 Weeks After Hip Replacement Surgery You may be able to return to all of your normal activities."
455,"If your doctor has told you that you have a fibroadenoma in your breast, don't panic. It's not cancer. These lumps are one the most common breast lumps in young women. Many times, they will shrink and disappear with no treatment. In other cases, doctors can remove them. A fibroadenoma is a benign, or noncancerous, breast tumor. Unlike a breast cancer, which grows larger over time and can spread to other organs, a fibroadenoma remains in the breast tissue. They're pretty small, too. Most are only 1 or 2 centimeters in size. It's very rare for them to get larger than 5 centimeters across. Usually, a fibroadenoma won't cause any pain. It will feel like a marble that moves around beneath your skin. You may describe the texture as firm, smooth, or rubbery. In some cases, though, you won't even be able to feel it at all. Since they're usually painless, you might not notice one until you feel a lump while you're in the shower. Other times, a doctor might find it on a mammogram or ultrasound. Unlike breast cancer, a fibroadenoma doesn't cause nipple discharge, swelling, redness, or skin irritation around the breast. Doctors don't know what causes them. They may be related to changing levels of hormones, since they often appear during puberty or pregnancy and go away after menopause. There are a few different kinds: Simple fibroadenomas. They look the same all over when you view them under a microscope. Complex fibroadenomas. These are bigger and tend to affect older women. They might have cells that grow rapidly. Juvenile fibroadenomas. These are the most common type of breast lump found in girls and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18. They can grow large, but most shrink over time. Some disappear. Giant fibroadenomas. They can grow to larger than 2 inches. They may need to be removed it they press on or replace other breast tissue. Fibroadenomas are very common. About 10% of women have one of these breast lumps, often without ever knowing. They most often appear in women between the ages of 15 and 35, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Some researchers have found that women with a family history of breast cancer are more likely to get fibroadenomas. Most women only have one. But about 10% to 15% of women who get them have more than one, either at the same time or over time. If you find a lump in your breast, you should see your doctor. You can't tell for sure what it is by how it feels. Your doctor will likely feel the lump so he can gauge its texture and size. Even if he thinks it might be a fibroadenoma, he'll recommend that you get more tests to confirm it. You may get an ultrasound or a mammogram, depending on your age and whether you're pregnant. Both are quick scans that you'll get in the doctor's office. A radiologist will then check the images of your breast tissue to see if it's a fibroadenoma or something else. The only way for a doctor to get know for sure that it's a fibroadenoma is through a biopsy, which means taking a sample of the lump to test in a lab. Based on the results of your examination and scan, your doctor will decide whether he needs to get extra confirmation from a biopsy. To do a biopsy, a doctor will insert a thin needle into your breast and pull out a small sample from the lump. You might not need any treatment. If your fibroadenoma is small, your doctor may recommend simply waiting to see whether the lump grows or shrinks rather than trying to remove it right away. Similarly, if you get a fibroadenoma during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, your doctor might wait until your hormone levels return to normal levels to see if the lump disappears on its own. If you've had more than one fibroadenoma removed in the past, and tests confirmed that that's what they were, your doctor also may delay removing any new lumps. If your fibroadenoma gets larger, the doctor suspects that it might, or he isn't sure whether a lump is a fibroadenoma or not, he'll likely recommend removing any lumps. This will help confirm that a lump isn't cancer and that it doesn't grow and distort the surrounding breast tissue. Depending on the size, location, and number of fibroadenomas, doctors have several ways to take them out: Lumpectomy or excisional biopsy: This is a short surgery to remove a fibroadenoma. Cryoablation: The doctor uses an ultrasound machine to see your fibroadenoma. He'll hold a tool called a cryoprobe against your skin. It uses a gas to freeze the nearby tissue, which destroys the fibroadenoma without surgery. Most women won't need anything beyond routine screening tests. They'll continue to get any breast changes checked out by a doctor. Having a simple fibroadenoma may raise your risk of breast cancer, compared with women without fibroadenomas. But if yours was complex, it might mean a slightly higher risk of breast cancer later on. Unless you have other things that make breast cancer more likely, like close family members with the disease, your odds are still low. Either way, keep up with your regular checkups, and ask your doctor which screening tests you need and when."
456,"Your doctor will do some simple tests to get clues about how well your ticker is doing. He'll listen to your heart, take your heart rate, and check your blood pressure. You may get a blood test, too. Your doctor will feel your pulse to check your heart rate and rhythm. Each pulse matches up with a heartbeat that pumps blood through your arteries. Finding out your pulse helps your doctor judge the strength of your blood flow and blood pressure in different areas of your body. You can tell how fast your heart beats and whether it's regular by feeling your pulse. Your heart rate is the number of times your heart beats in 1 minute. To measure your pulse on your own: Get a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers. Count the number of taps you feel in 10 seconds. Multiply that number by 6 to find out your heart rate for 1 minute. Besides checking your pulse, your doctor can hear the opening and closing of your heart valves by using a stethoscope. Blood pressure is the force of the blood against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps it around your body. There are two ways it's measured: Systolic blood pressure. This is the pressure in your arteries when your heart squeezes. Diastolic blood pressure. It's the pressure in your when your heart is relaxed, between heartbeats. Normal blood pressure for an adult, when you're at rest, is less than 120 over less than 80. The 120 is the systolic pressure. The diastolic pressure is 79. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 or higher. Years of high blood pressure can stiffen and narrow your artery walls, which blocks the blood flow to your heart. It can lead to heart disease or heart attack. Your blood pressure may go up or down depending on your age, heart condition, emotions, activity, and the medications you take. One high reading doesn't mean you have high blood pressure. You need to measure it at different times while you're resting to find out your typical numbers. Your doctor may suggest a blood test to check your levels of sodium, potassium, albumin, and creatinine. Abnormal levels could suggest problems with organs like your kidneys and liver, possible signs of heart failure. A blood test can measure levels of your cholesterol, including LDL ""bad"" cholesterol and HDL ""good"" cholesterol. It can also help diagnose other conditions such as anemia or thyroid disease that can affect your heart."
457,"A migraines isn't just a headache. Along with the head pain, it also can cause nausea, dizziness, and sensitivity to light and sound. A loud noise or bright light that wouldn't bother most people can be extremely painful. Tell your doctor if you're sensitive to light or sound with your migraine. Knowing about these symptoms can help her choose the right way to help you with them. A migraine starts with overactive nerve cells in your brain. These cells send a message that makes some blood vessels wider and releases chemicals that cause the vessel to become inflamed. This leads to the throbbing pain you feel. Bright lights -- like the glare from a TV screen or the reflection of light off a window -- or loud sounds can trigger that reaction. And once you have the headache, you may be more sensitive to those things as well. Headaches are just one symptom of the overall migraine condition. Researchers have found that people who get migraines have extra connections in the parts of their brains that process light and sound. Those areas are more active than they are in people who don't get migraines, and that leads to a bigger response. About 80% of people who get migraine headaches are sensitive to light. That's called photophobia. People who only get the attacks from time to time are less likely to be light sensitive than those who have chronic migraines. Researchers think photophobia starts in your optic nerve, which carries messages from your eye to your brain. The response can be so extreme that you may need to wear dark sunglasses or lie down in a dark room to feel better. Being sensitive to loud noises, called phonophobia, often comes along with light sensitivity. One way to treat migraine pain and other symptoms is with medication. Migraine drugs come in two forms: Preventive agents that are taken on a daily basis to reduce attack frequency. These include antidepressants, beta-blockers, and anti-seizure drugs can sometimes help stop headaches before they start. You might need to take these every day. Acute therapies, like triptans and ergots, can help with the pain once you have a headache. They also can help with sound and light sensitivity. They work best if you take them as soon as possible after your headache starts. You can make a few small changes at home and at work to manage your light and sound triggers. To manage light sensitivity: Put blinds over your windows to prevent glare from sunlight. Use soft lighting. Don't use fluorescent bulbs, which can flicker. Flickering light can set off migraines in some people. Place lights away from areas where they might reflect and cause glare. Don't aim the light at a mirror, TV, wall, or computer screen. Adjust the brightness and angle of your computer screen to cut down on glare and reflections. Many people with migraines are most sensitive to red and blue light. Special sunglasses can filter these out. To manage sound sensitivity: Avoid concerts, movies, big parties, or other places you know will be loud. Wear noise-canceling headphones or earplugs. Cover your windows with heavy drapes (which will block light, too), and install thick carpet to absorb sounds in your home. Turn on a white noise machine. This gentle sound can drown out louder noises. You might not want to avoid sound entirely. If you surround yourself with silence, you can become even more sensitive, and that could lead to headaches that are more painful."
458,"To understand how high blood pressure can lead to erectile dysfunction, you first have to understand how erections work. Getting an erection is really a complicated process. In the shaft of the penis there are two side-by-side chambers of spongy tissue called the corpora cavernosa. They're mainly responsible for erections. Just below them is another chamber called the corpus spongiosum. The urethra, which carries semen and urine, runs through the center of it. The corpora cavernosa are made of small arteries and veins, smooth muscle fiber, and empty spaces. The chambers are wrapped in a sheath of thin tissue. When you get an erection, signals from the brain or nerve endings in the penis cause the smooth muscle of the chambers to relax and arteries to dilate, or open wider. This allows a rush of blood to fill the empty spaces. The pressure of blood flow causes the sheath of tissue around the chambers to press on veins that normally drain blood out of the penis. That traps blood in the penis. As more blood flows in, the penis expands and stiffens, and you have an erection. When the excitement ends, the smooth muscle contracts again, taking pressure off the veins and allowing blood to flow back out of the penis. Then the penis returns to a flaccid state. High blood pressure is a major cause of erection problems. A study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that about 49% of men ages 40 to 79 with high blood pressure had erectile dysfunction. Another study of men with high blood pressure, published in the Journal of Urology, found that 68% of them had some degree of erectile dysfunction. For 45% of the men, it was considered severe. High blood pressure keeps the arteries that carry blood into the penis from dilating the way they're supposed to. It also makes the smooth muscle in the penis lose its ability to relax. As a result, not enough blood flows into the penis to make it erect. Men with high blood pressure may also have a low testosterone level. Testosterone is the male hormone that plays a big role in sexual arousal. High blood pressure by itself can lead to erectile dysfunction. But some drugs for treating high blood pressure can actually be the cause as well. Diuretics -- or water pills -- and beta-blockers are the high blood pressure drugs most commonly linked to erectile dysfunction. Diuretics may cause erectile dysfunction by decreasing the force of blood flow into the penis. They may also decrease the amount of zinc in the body. Your body needs zinc to make testosterone. Beta-blockers dampen the response to nerve impulses that lead to an erection. They also make it more difficult for the arteries in the penis to widen and let in blood. What's more, they can make you feel sedated and depressed -- and the mind always plays some part in sexual arousal. Sometimes, the choices that some men with high blood pressure make can add to the problem. Smoking, especially, is one of those. Smoking increases blood pressure, and damages blood vessels and reduces blood flow all around the body. The power to take control of your blood pressure and sexual health is in your hands. By living a healthy lifestyle and working with your doctor, there's a chance you'll once again be able to have normal sexual function."
459," Sleep apnea is a condition in which you stop breathing while asleep. With sleep apnea, your breathing while you are asleep is interrupted by repeated pauses known as apneic events. The types of sleep apnea include: obstructive sleep apnea, which is the most common form of sleep apnea; central sleep apnea; and mixed (or complex) sleep apnea, which combines the two other types. Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems. It can increase the risk for stroke, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure. It may also increase the risk for accidents while working or driving, as some people with sleep apnea may fall asleep during those activities. In CSA, breathing is disrupted regularly during sleep because of the way the brain functions. It is not that you cannot breathe (which is true in obstructive sleep apnea); rather, you do not try to breathe at all. The brain does not tell your muscles to breathe. This type of sleep apnea is usually associated with serious illness, especially an illness in which the lower brainstem -- which controls breathing -- is affected. In infants, central sleep apnea produces pauses in breathing that can last 20 seconds. Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially adults older than age 65. This could be because they may have other medical conditions or sleep patterns that are more likely to cause CSA. Another factor, is being male. Men are more at risk for both CSA and obstructive sleep apnea. Being overweight is a risk factors for OSA but is generally not considered a risk factor for CSA. However, anyone can have any of the types of sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is often associated with other conditions. One form of central sleep apnea, however, has no known cause and is not associated with any other disease. In addition, central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea, or it can occur alone. Conditions that may be associated with central sleep apnea include the following: Congestive heart failure Hypothyroid Disease Kidney failure Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) Damage to the brainstem caused by encephalitis, stroke, injury, or other factors The main symptom of CSA is temporary stoppages of breathing while asleep. Although snoring is a very strong symptom of obstructive sleep apnea, snoring is usually not found with central sleep apnea. Symptoms may also include: Being very tired during the day Waking up often during the night Having headaches in the early morning Poor memory and difficulty concentrating Mood problems If you have any of these symptoms of central sleep apnea, or if a family member or bed partner notices that you stop breathing while sleeping, you should talk to your doctor or health care provider. If your doctor suspects you have central sleep apnea, he is likely to perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and recommend a sleep history. The next step will likely be an overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. This test is performed in a sleep lab under the direct supervision of a trained technologist. During the test, the following body functions may be monitored: Electrical activity of the brain Eye movements Muscle activity Heart rate Breathing patterns Air flow Blood oxygen levels After the study is completed, the technologist will tally the number of times that breathing is impaired during sleep and then grade the severity of sleep apnea. If CSA is associated with some other condition, such as congestive heart failure, that condition is treated, if possible. Some of the more conservative treatments for obstructive sleep apnea would likely benefit people with central sleep apnea as well. Some of these conservative treatments include: Losing weight if necessary, and then maintaining a healthy weight Avoiding the use of alcohol and sleeping pills, as these items make the airway more likely to collapse during sleep Sleeping on your side if you have apneic events when sleeping on your back, possibly using pillows or other devices to keep you in place Using nasal sprays or breathing strips to keep air flowing if you have sinus problems or nasal congestion Avoiding sleep deprivation Another treatment is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP), which is the preferred initial treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnea. The treatment has been beneficial in people with central sleep apnea, as well. This is especially true of people who have central sleep apnea associated with heart failure. With CPAP, patients wear a mask over their nose and/or mouth. An air blower forces air through the nose and/or mouth. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing during sleep. The pressure is constant and continuous. CPAP prevents airway closure while it is being used, but apnea episodes return when CPAP is stopped or is used improperly. Other styles and types of positive airway pressure devices are available for people who have difficulty tolerating CPAP. ASV ( Adaptive servo-ventilation) and BPAP ( Bilevel positive airway pressure) are other devices which deliver pressurized air. For patients with moderate to severe central sleep apnea, the FDA has recently approved an implantable device called the Remede System. The small machine is surgically placed under the skin in the upper chest area where it helps stimulate the nerve which moves your diaphragm when you breathe. It monitors your respiratory signals while you sleep and helps restore normal breathing patterns. Medications can be used under some circumstances. Several different medications aimed at improving CSA include acetazolamide, theophylline, and sedative-hypnotic agents."
460,"There are many different conditions that are recognized as mental illnesses. The more common types include:  Anxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Mood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness. The most common mood disorders are depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymic disorder. Psychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations -- the experience of images or sounds that are not real, such as hearing voices -- and delusions, which are false fixed beliefs that the ill person accepts as true, despite evidence to the contrary. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Impulse control and addiction disorders: People with impulse control disorders are unable to resist urges, or impulses, to perform acts that could be harmful to themselves or others. Pyromania (starting fires), kleptomania (stealing), and compulsive gambling are examples of impulse control disorders. Alcohol and drug are common objects of addictions. Often, people with these disorders become so involved with the objects of their addiction that they begin to ignore responsibilities and relationships. Personality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships. In addition, the person's patterns of thinking and behavior significantly differ from the expectations of society and are so rigid that they interfere with the person's normal functioning. Examples include antisocial personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and paranoid personality disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. The disturbing thoughts are called obsessions, and the rituals are called compulsions. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes his or her hands. Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD): PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster. People with PTSD often have lasting and frightening thoughts and memories of the event, and tend to be emotionally numb. Other, less common types of mental illnesses include: Stress response syndromes (formerly called adjustment disorders): Stress response syndromes occur when a person develops emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to a stressful event or situation. The stressors may include natural disasters, such as an earthquake or tornado; events or crises, such as a car accident or the diagnosis of a major illness; or interpersonal problems, such as a divorce, death of a loved one, loss of a job, or a problem with substance abuse. Stress response syndromes usually begin within three months of the event or situation and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated. Dissociative disorders: People with these disorders suffer severe disturbances or changes in memory, consciousness, identity, and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings. These disorders usually are associated with overwhelming stress, which may be the result of traumatic events, accidents, or disasters that may be experienced or witnessed by the individual. Dissociative identity disorder, formerly called multiple personality disorder, or ""split personality,"" and depersonalization disorder are examples of dissociative disorders. Factitious disorders: Factitious disorders are conditions in which a person knowingly and intentionally creates or complains of physical and/or emotional symptoms in order to place the individual in the role of a patient or a person in need of help. Sexual and gender disorders: These include disorders that affect sexual desire, performance, and behavior. Sexual dysfunction, gender identity disorder, and the paraphilias are examples of sexual and gender disorders. Somatic symptom disorders: A person with a somatic symptom disorder, formerly known as a psychosomatic disorder or somatoform disorder, experiences physical symptoms of an illness or of pain with an excessive and disproportionate level of distress, regardless of whether or not a doctor can find a medical cause for the symptoms. Tic disorders: People with tic disorders make sounds or display nonpurposeful body movements that are repeated, quick, sudden, and/or uncontrollable. ( Sounds that are made involuntarily are called vocal tics.) Tourette's syndrome is an example of a tic disorder. Other diseases or conditions, including various sleep-related problems and many forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, are sometimes classified as mental illnesses, because they involve the brain."
461,"Your knee is the largest joint in your body. The kneecap, or patella, is the bone that covers your knee. It helps give the joint strength and structure, which allows your legs to bend and turn safely. Because your knee has many working parts and carries a heavy load, it's prone to problems. If you have any of these issues with your kneecap, see your doctor so you can figure out the right treatment. Some of them can get better with physical therapy, while others may need surgery. Your kneecap can get knocked out of place, or dislocated, when your leg is planted and you suddenly change direction. It can also happen when something hits your leg and forces it in another direction. Signs that you've dislocated your kneecap include: The joint looks out of place, though it might move back on its own A popping sound or feeling Severe pain You can't straighten your leg or walk Sudden swelling Your knee also might dislocate without an injury because there's a problem with the structure. That's called patellar instability. It's most common in children and teens, though it can happen in adults, too. Structural issues might include: The kneecap rests in a notch at the end of the thigh bone called the trochlear groove. If that notch is very shallow or uneven, it's easier for the patella to slide out of place. Your ligaments are looser, making your joints more flexible and likely to dislocate. This is especially true of girls. Cerebral palsy and Down syndrome can cause muscle weakness and balance problems that affect kneecaps. Some children are born with unstable kneecaps. No matter the cause, symptoms of kneecap dislocation are the same. This happens when your kneecap slides a little out of place but doesn't dislocate entirely. It's also a type of patellar instability. Symptoms that your kneecap has subluxated include: Pain in the front of your knee A feeling that your kneecap is loose Your knee suddenly buckles In a fall, landing directly on your knee A direct hit to your knee, like slamming it against the dashboard in a car accident If you break your kneecap, your symptoms might include: Bruises You can't walk You can't straighten your knee or keep it straight when you raise your leg This catch-all term describes pain in the front of the knee and around the kneecap. Sometimes it's called ârunner's kneeâ or a âtrackingâ problem. If you have this condition, you might hurt when you: Go up or down stairs Kneel or squat Sit with your knees bent for a long time, such as during a movie or plane ride You might also hear popping or crackling in your knees when you climb stairs or get up after you've been sitting a long time. Patellofemoral pain syndrome can happen because of strain on your knees, like climbing too many steps. The pain might start because you've suddenly started to exercise more, such as going from working out 3 days a week to 6. Or maybe you've made your workouts more intense. Other things that might bring on patellofemoral pain syndrome: Poor exercise technique The wrong equipment, such as shoes Changing your exercise surface; for instance, running on streets after you've been running on a track Patellofemoral pain syndrome also may come from an alignment problem in how your knee works. When you have misalignment, or a patellar tracking issue, your kneecap can push to one side of the trochlear groove when you bend your knee. That irritates the area, causing pain. Tracking problems could come from overall alignment issues between your leg and hip. Weak thigh muscles can also be part of the problem. You can't avoid every possible injury to your kneecap. But you can take some simple steps to help keep your knees healthy: Wear the right shoes for your activity. Warm up before you work out. Do exercises to keep your thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstrings) strong and flexible. If you're going to make your workouts longer or more intense, do it gradually. Cut back on anything that causes knee pain. Stay at a healthy weight -- it lowers stress on your knees."
462,"When you have diabetes, your blood sugar (aka blood glucose) levels may be consistently high. Over time, this can damage your body and lead to many other problems. How much sugar in the blood is too much? And why is high glucose so bad for you? Here's a look at how your levels affect your health. They're less than 100 mg/d L after not eating (fasting) for at least 8 hours. And they're less than 140 mg/d L 2 hours after eating. During the day, levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/d L. For some people, 60 is normal; for others, 90. What's a low sugar level? It varies widely, too. Many people's glucose won't ever fall below 60, even with prolonged fasting. When you diet or fast, the liver keeps your levels normal by turning fat and muscle into sugar. A few people's levels may fall somewhat lower. Doctors use these tests to find out if you have diabetes: Fasting plasma glucose test. The doctor tests your blood sugar levels after fasting for 8 hours and it's higher than 126 mg/d L. Oral glucose tolerance test. After fasting for 8 hours, you get a special sugary drink. Two hours later your sugar level is higher than 200. Random check. The doctor tests your blood sugar and it's higher than 200, plus you're peeing more, always thirsty, and you've gained or lost a significant amount of weight. He'll then do a fasting sugar level test or an oral glucose tolerance test to confirm the diagnosis. Any sugar levels higher than normal are unhealthy. Levels that are higher than normal, but not reaching the point of full-blown diabetes, are called prediabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, 86 million people in the U. S. have this condition, which can lead to diabetes if you don't make healthy lifestyle changes that your doctor recommends. It also raises the risk for heart disease, although not as much as diabetes does. It's possible to keep prediabetes from becoming diabetes with diet and exercise. Why are high blood sugar levels bad for you? Glucose is precious fuel for all the cells in your body when it's present at normal levels. But it can behave like a slow-acting poison. High sugar levels slowly erode the ability of cells in your pancreas to make insulin. The organ overcompensates and insulin levels stay too high. Over time, the pancreas is permanently damaged. High levels of blood sugar can cause changes that lead to a hardening of the blood vessels, what doctors call atherosclerosis. Almost any part of your body can be harmed by too much sugar. Damaged blood vessels cause problems such as: Kidney disease or kidney failure, requiring dialysis Strokes Heart attacks Vision loss or blindness Weakened immune system, with a greater risk of infections Erectile dysfunction Nerve damage, also called neuropathy, that causes tingling, pain, or less sensation in your feet, legs, and hands Poor circulation to the legs and feet Slow wound-healing and the potential for amputation in rare cases Keep your blood sugar levels close to normal to avoid many of these complications. The American Diabetes Association's goals for blood sugar control in people with diabetes are 70 to 130 mg/d L before meals, and less than 180 mg/d L after meals."
463,"If you've been constipated for a while, you should find out why. If there's a problem with your how your lower intestinal tract (colon, rectum, and anus) are working, you have âfunctional constipation.â But if that's not the case, you could have âsecondary constipationâ -- that's when it's brought on by a medical problem or a medication you take. Some medications can cause constipation as a side effect. They include: Heartburn medications like aluminum or calcium antacids Certain depression medications Calcium channel blockers that control blood pressure Diuretics (water pills) Drugs to lessen or treat muscle spasms in your gut Iron pills to treat some kinds of anemia Epilepsy medications Painkillers such as morphine, codeine or other opioids If your doctor thinks it's something you're taking, talk to him about your other options. You may have something else going on that's slowing down your digestion. Several conditions are known to cause such problems: Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS) causes belly pain, gas, bloating, and a change in bathroom habits. If you have IBS with constipation ( IBS- C), you may notice that your symptoms flare and then normal bowel habits return. Sometimes, bouts of diarrhea or loose stools happen, too. Diabetes: Constipation is common for people with this condition. It's thought that diabetes may affect nerves in the colon, which can slow down the movement of stool. Hypothyroidism: This happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. This can slow down many of your body functions, including your bowels. Neurological diseases: Constipation is more common in people with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal injuries, and the neuromuscular disease muscular dystrophy. People with these conditions can have problems relaxing muscles in the pelvic floor which makes it hard to push stool out. Or their colons may work more slowly, leading to fewer bowel movements. Colon cancer: Constipation and/or a change in the color or shape of your stool can be a sign of this cancer. If it's red, maroon, or very dark, you could have blood in your stool. Crohn's disease: This causes irritation and swelling in any part of the digestive tract. If it happens in your rectum, you may get constipated. Diverticulosis: This happens when small pouches bulge out from the wall of your colon. Some people don't have symptoms. But you may have bloating, cramping, diarrhea, and constipation. These symptoms may get worse if the pouches get swollen or infected. That's a problem called diverticulitis. Pregnancy: About 2 in 5 pregnant women get constipated. It's usually more of a problem during the first few months. When you're expecting, your body makes more of the hormone progesterone. It acts as a muscle relaxant. That slows down the natural movement of your bowels, so waste doesn't move as fast through your system. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have one of these conditions. Make sure he's aware of all your symptoms. You'll probably need tests to find out what's going on. No matter the cause, your doctor can help you get the treatment to get things moving through your system again."
464,"Vascular diseases affect blood vessels. They lower blood flow to organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. If they cut blood flow to the penis, they can cause erectile dysfunction. These diseases may be the cause of ED in as many as 50% to 70% of men who have it. The good news is that lifestyle changes and drug treatments usually help fight the types of vascular disease that can cause erectile dysfunction. Usually, a vascular disease happens when cholesterol and other substances build up and block blood vessels. In some men, the arteries and veins in the penis, and the rest of the body, may not work properly. They may keep blood from flowing when they're not supposed to. Some common health conditions are linked with vascular disease and clogged arteries: Coronary artery disease (clogged arteries in the heart) High blood pressure Diabetes High cholesterol Obesity Peripheral vascular disease, which affects the blood vessels that send blood to the arms, hands, legs, and feet If you have one of these conditions, it's more likely that the problem can affect the blood vessels in your penis and cause erectile dysfunction. Also, smoking greatly raises your chances for clogged arteries and vascular disease. If you have erectile dysfunction, it helps to kick the habit. Your penis must store blood to keep an erection. If the veins can't keep blood there during an erection, you'll lose it. This is called venous leak. It may happen with vascular disease. It's also linked to diabetes, Peyronie's disease (a buildup of scar tissue in the penis that leads to curved, painful erections), some nerve conditions, and even severe anxiety."
465,"Doctors have a lot of tools that can treat melanoma. Generally, the earlier you and your doctor catch it, the simpler it is to handle. The treatment you get will depend on a few things: How deep the melanoma is in your skin Whether it has spread to other parts of your body Your general health Often, the first step is to remove the tumor from your skin, usually with surgery. Your doctor or surgeon will numb your skin and cut out the melanoma, plus some extra skin around it. You'll have stitches for 1-2 weeks. If it isn't deep, a doctor who treats skin, called a dermatologist, can do the operation during a regular surgery visit, and you can go home right after. This might be all you need, especially if the cancer is only in the top layer of your skin. If the tumor has grown deep into your skin or spread to other parts of your body, treatment is more complex. You might need surgery to remove lymph nodes near the melanoma to see if the cancer has spread there. For example, if the problem is on your arm, the surgeon might take out the lymph nodes under your armpit. Other options are: Immunotherapy. This approach uses drugs that help your immune system find and attack cancer cells. You might get them in a shot or go to a treatment center or hospital to get them through an IV every 2-4 weeks. If the melanoma is on your face, your doctor might prescribe a cream that revs up the immune cells only around the tumor, instead of in your whole body like the other drugs. Sometimes, immunotherapy drugs can make your body attack your healthy organs. If that happens, you'll need to stop taking them and get other treatment to stop the attack. Chemotherapy. These drugs travel through your body and attack cancer cells. Some chemotherapy drugs are pills, and others you get through an IV. Targeted therapy. Cancer happens when cells grow and divide too fast or don't die when they should. This can happen because of bad genes inside the cells. In targeted therapy, drugs go after changes in melanoma cells that make them grow out of control. This treatment tends to stop working well after a while. If that happens, you and your doctor will need to try another approach. Radiation. A specialist will zap the area with high-energy rays, which kill cancer cells. It's like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Clinical trials. Scientists are working on finding new treatments for melanoma. But they have to test them and compare how they work to current therapies before they become available for everyone. They do this in research studies called clinical trials. Your doctor might know if you can sign up for one. If you're accepted, you could get either a regular treatment that's already available or the one that scientists are testing. Your doctor might recommend more than one treatment at a time, like chemotherapy plus radiation. It depends on whether the cancer has spread and how far it has gone. Melanoma treatments might cause other kinds of health problems, including: Pain Scars Swelling in your arms or legs, called lymphedema. It happens when your body holds on to fluid because your lymph system is blocked or damaged. Infection Feeling tired Feeling sick to your stomach Constipation or diarrhea Anxiety or depression The side effects you have depend on the stage of your disease, how much treatment you get and how long it takes, and your general health. Some of them can last for a while after you finish treatment. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any side effects, even if you think they're no big deal. There are almost always ways to control them so you'll feel better. Melanoma can come back after treatment. It can show up where it was before, or it can start on other places on your skin or in an organ inside your body like your liver. Your doctor will want to watch you closely for signs that the disease has returned, so it's important to keep your appointments for checkups. How often you have to see your doctor depends on what stage your melanoma was in when you were diagnosed. Usually it's every 6-12 months for disease in the early stages, and every 3-6 months for more advanced ones."
466,"Stomach pain can range from a dull ache to a sharp twinge. It can make you feel nauseous, bloated, or full. You might have gas or diarrhea, or you might be constipated. It can bother you for a short while or for hours. With so many kinds of belly pain, it's no surprise that different things can cause it. Some are out of your control, like if you have appendicitis. But you can change a few habits to make other kinds less likely to happen. If you tend to take big bites and eat without chewing well, you can swallow air, which adds gas to your stomach and can lead to stomach pain. Take time to chew slowly and swallow without rushing. This also gives your brain time to realize you're full before you eat too much. Some people get belly pain between meals, when there's no buffer for the acid in your stomach. If this happens, eat smaller meals or snacks spaced out throughout the day so your stomach isn't empty for long periods. The opposite also can cause stomach pain. If you eat so much that you feel stuffed, your stomach is likely to hurt. Fatty, fried, or spicy foods could be behind your stomach woes. They can wreak havoc on your gut as your body digests them. They also can slow down the process and make you more likely to get constipated. If you eat more nutritious foods, with a focus on veggies and fiber, you'll digest things at a healthy speed, and your stomach will thank you. If you notice your stomach always cramps up after you drink a glass of milk or eat a certain thing, see your doctor. You might have a problem with dairy products (called lactose intolerance) or another kind of food. If your doctor finds an issue in your diet, she can help you find ways to stay away from it or eat less of it. It's a good idea to work with your doctor on this instead of trying to figure it out on your own. You could get on the wrong track and miss out on nutrients from some foods without really needing to. Water helps keep things moving in your gut so you stay regular. Pay attention to your body when you're thirsty, and have a glass of water, not soda. Carbonation can cause stomach pain because the fizz can lead to gas. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages can cause trouble for some people, too, so steer clear of them if they bother your stomach. A common cause of stomach pain is gastroenteritis, sometimes called a stomach bug or a stomach virus. It can cause diarrhea, nausea, fever, or a headache, too. The best way to prevent the spread of germs is to wash your hands often, especially before you eat, after you go to the bathroom, and when you've been in public places. Some people feel their hearts race or their palms sweat when they're stressed or anxious. And plenty of people have stomach pain. They may feel their stomachs churn or seem to tie up in knots. The obvious answer is to stay out of stressful situations when you can. Since that's not always possible, you can ease stress with things like exercise, meditation, hobbies, or hanging out with friends. If those don't work, it might help to talk with your doctor or a therapist about ways to manage it. You can't prevent all types of stomach pain, and in some cases, you may need medicine, surgery, or another kind of treatment. If you have sharp or severe stomach pain, get medical help right away. Some things that can cause stomach pain include: Appendicitis Gallstones Kidney stones Stomach ulcers Irritable bowel syndrome Colitis/ Crohn's disease (inflammation of your colon) Celiac disease (a digestive disorder that damages your colon) Ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilized egg is attached outside the uterus) Side effects of medication"
467,"We still have a lot to learn about the healing powers of food. But this much we know: Chicken soup can help clear your stuffy nose, and ginger seems to settle an upset stomach. That's not all. Dark greens such as spinach are loaded with vitamins A and C. And salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have an anti-inflammatory effect. Quite simply, a well-nourished immune system, your body's defense against germs, is better able to ward off infections. So eat healthy this cold season and throughout the year. Enjoy these recipes from the kitchen of Charlotte Mathis, MD. 1 chicken, cut into 8-10 pieces (remove skin, leave bone in) 8 cups of chicken broth (homemade is preferable, but unsalted, low-fat boxed or canned is fine**) 3 large cloves of garlic, chopped 1/2 cup chopped onion 2 carrots, peeled, thinly sliced 2 celery stalks, sliced 8 ounces dried wide egg noodles or 1 cup uncooked long-grain rice 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried thyme Pat chicken parts dry. Season pieces with salt and pepper. Brown chicken parts in a heavy Dutch oven with 1 teaspoon of canola oil over medium-high heat for about 6-8 minutes, turning once. Add chicken broth to the pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Cover partially and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer chicken to a large bowl. Cool chicken and broth slightly. Discard bones from chicken. Cut or pull apart chicken meat into bite-sized pieces and reserve. Spoon fat off top of chicken broth. Return broth to simmer. Add onion, carrots, celery, and thyme. Simmer until vegetables soften, about 8 minutes. ( You can prepare 1 day ahead, but be sure to store broth and meat separately in the fridge.) Stir in noodles, parsley, and reserved chicken. Simmer until noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. If you use rice, simmer until the rice is done. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup bowls, and garnish it with parsley if you want. ** You can make canned soup taste more like homemade if you simmer it for about 45 minutes with a couple of celery stalks, carrots, half a chopped onion, a bit of garlic, some peppercorns, and a bay leaf. Strain before using. 1/2 cup thinly sliced fresh ginger 6 cups water 2 cinnamon sticks 2 tablespoons honey or brown sugar lemon wedges for garnish if desired In a saucepan, simmer ginger, cinnamon, and water 20 minutes, or more for stronger tea. Add honey or sugar and strain tea through a sieve. It's great for a sore throat. 4 lemons several slices of ginger root honey to taste Juice several lemons, then scrub the peel well. Slice it thinly, and add to the juice. Cover all with plenty of boiling water, put a lid on it, and steep until cool. For added benefit, add several slices of ginger root before covering with water. Strain off the liquid, add honey and additional water to taste. Drink hot. NOTE: Never give honey to any child less than 12 months old. It can cause botulism food poisoning in this age group. 1 bag of fresh spinach or mixed salad greens 2 fennel bulbs (cleaned, cut in half lengthwise, and sliced thinly crosswise) For the dressing: 2 scallions, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, minced 2 tablespoons oriental sesame oil 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 tablespoon chopped, peeled fresh ginger 1 tablespoon honey (see note below) 1/4 cup canola oil Blend first seven dressing ingredients in food processor. With machine running, gradually add oil and process until well blended. ( You can prepare this 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature before you use it.) Toss fennel and greens with dressing. Enjoy! NOTE: Never give honey to any child less than 12 months old. It can cause botulism food poisoning in this age group. 4 salmon fillets with skin on salt, pepper to taste 3 tablespoons fresh herbs, such as chives, rosemary, or thyme For the salsa: 1 fennel bulb finely diced, plus 1 tablespoon minced fennel leaves 1/2 cup finely diced oranges 10 green olives pitted and minced 1 tablespoon fresh orange juice 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste Preheat oven to 250 degrees. While it's heating, make the salsa. In a medium bowl, stir together the fennel bulb and leaves, the diced orange, the olives, the juices, and salt and pepper to taste. Then, place salmon skin side down on a baking sheet sprayed with olive oil. Brush fish with a bit more olive oil, sprinkle salt and pepper, and press the herbs into the flesh. Set aside. When the oven is hot, ""slow-roast"" the salmon for 17 minutes. For safety, make sure that the fish reaches a temperature of 145 F. If you don't have a thermometer, make sure it flakes with a fork. Serve salmon with salsa on the side."
468,"Your first days and weeks with your newborn can be full of joy. But also full of diaper changes, naps, feedings, and questions about what's normal. As you get to know your baby, you'll learn her cues and the schedule that works best for her. But from sleep to diapers to mealtime, there are a few basics you can expect from your newborn. Most newborns will want to eat every 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Their feeding schedule usually depends on if you're breastfeeding or giving your baby formula. Breastfed babies generally eat more often than those on formula, because their tummies digest breast milk faster. There are many ways babies can tell you they're hungry. They may make sucking motions, put their hands or fingers in their mouths, or you may notice that your baby turns her head toward you and opens her mouth if you gently stroke her cheek. Babies do cry when they want to eat, but it's usually a late sign of hunger. Try to get your baby to burp during and after her feeding. If she stops eating and falls asleep, or turns her head away from the bottle, those are good signs she's had enough. If she cries toward the end, that may mean she's hungry for more. And keep the burp cloth handy -- most newborns spit up after feedings every once in a while. Newborns have six or more wet diapers and four or more poopy ones each day. For the first week or so, your baby's poops will look thick and black or dark green. That's called meconium, and it's the substance that filled her intestines before she was born. After that's out of her system, her poop will become soft and runny. If you breastfeed her, she will have light yellowish, seedy-looking poop. If she eats formula, it will be firmer and tan or yellow in color. After a few weeks, the pooping slows down. Breastfed babies can go a week with just one bowel movement, while formula-fed babies should poop at least once a day. Crying is the main way babies communicate, especially in their early days. The cries can be hard to decode, but you can think about her schedule or surroundings to figure out what's wrong. If it's been 2 hours since she last ate, there's a good chance she's hungry. If she's been up for an hour and a half, she's probably due for a nap. Babies can also get bored or overstimulated. If it's not time to feed your baby and she has a dry diaper, you can try a few other ways to soothe her: Tightly swaddle her in a large, thin blanket, to mimic how she was snuggled in the womb. Snuggle her to your chest and gently pat her on the back. Rock, walk, or bounce her. Move to a quiet place and turn on a calming sound, like a fan or a white noise machine. Offer a pacifier, or help her find her finger or thumb to suck. New babies often get tired after being awake just an hour or two. The first few weeks, your baby will snooze about 16 hours a day, usually in 2- to 4-hour stretches, any time of day or night. Many will fall asleep while they're eating or sucking, and that's just fine. Yawning, drooping eyelids, looking away, fussing, and eye rubbing are all signs of a sleepy baby. Always put your child on her back to sleep, on a firm sleep surface, with nothing else in the crib or bassinet -- just a mattress with a tightly fitted sheet. By the end of the first month, newborns start to fit their sleep into longer periods. But it will be a few more months before your baby gets into a predictable pattern of a morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon nap, and a longer stretch of sleep at night. In between all the eating, sleeping, and diaper changes, newborns have short periods when they're awake and alert. This is a great time to play with them. Your baby is learning the sound of your voice, the sight of your face, and your touch. Smile, sing, read, and talk to her, sway with her to music, make funny faces for her to imitate, and offer interesting objects for her to feel and look at. At this age, babies don't need toys -- your face and eyes, your baby's hands and feet, and simple objects like a rattle, shatterproof mirror, or colorful scarf will offer plenty of entertainment. This is also when you can introduce your baby to tummy time. A few minutes of play time on her belly each day will help her build stronger head and neck muscles and work on the coordination she needs to roll over and crawl -- some of the next big milestones she'll reach."
469,"There's no special asthma diet. We don't know of any foods that reduce the airway inflammation of asthma. Beverages that contain caffeine provide a slight amount of bronchodilation for an hour or two, but taking a rescue inhaler is much more effective for the temporary relief of asthma symptoms. However, a good diet is an important part of your overall asthma treatment plan. Just like regular exercise, a healthy diet is good for everyone. That goes for people with asthma, too. Obesity is associated with more severe asthma, so you want to take steps to maintain a healthy weight. What's more, many doctors suspect that the specific foods you eat might have a direct impact on your asthma. But further research needs to be done before we understand the exact connection between asthma and diet. If you are allergic to certain foods, you should avoid them. Allergies can trigger asthma symptoms. The incidence of asthma has risen in the United States during the past three decades, and many researchers believe that our changing diets have something to do with it. As Americans eat fewer and fewer fruits and vegetables and more processed foods, could it be that we're bumping up our risk of developing asthma? Several research studies have suggested this, and others are ongoing, but the connection between diet and asthma remains inconclusive. There's evidence that people who eat diets higher in vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, flavonoids, magnesium, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids have lower rates of asthma. Many of these substances are antioxidants, which protect cells from damage. One recent study of asthma and diet showed that teens with poor nutrition were more likely to have asthma symptoms. Those who didn't get enough fruits and foods with vitamins C and E and omega-3 fatty acids were the most likely to have poor lung function. A 2007 study showed that children who grew up eating a Mediterranean diet -- high in nuts and fruits like grapes, apples, and tomatoes -- were less likely to have asthma-like symptoms. However, it's not at all clear that deficiencies of these nutrients actually caused the asthma. And studies that have used specific vitamins and minerals to treat asthma have been unsuccessful. Why? Some researchers think that it might be the interaction of different vitamins, minerals, and other antioxidants that naturally occur in foods that have the health benefits. Therefore, it's unlikely that taking vitamins, minerals, or other food supplements will improve your asthma control and prevent symptoms of asthma. Regardless of the specific link between asthma and diet, we do know that good nutrition is important for anyone, and especially people with chronic diseases. If you're not getting the right nutrients, your body may be more susceptible to illness and have a harder time fighting the respiratory viruses that often trigger an asthma attack or severe asthma emergency. Given the murky evidence for a link between asthma and nutrition, there is no particular asthma diet. But it's a good idea to adhere to a healthy diet, anyway. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. We still don't know which fruits and vegetables might have an effect on asthma, so the best advice is to increase your intake of a wide variety of them. Eat foods with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids -- found in fish like salmon, tuna, and sardines and some plant sources, like flaxseed -- are believed to have a number of health benefits. Although the evidence that they help with asthma is not clear, it's still a good idea to include them in your diet. Avoid trans fats and omega-6 fatty acids. There's some evidence that eating omega-6 fats and trans fats, found in some margarines and processed foods, may worsen asthma, and other serious health conditions such as heart disease. Nutrition -- good or bad -- isn't the only way that asthma might be affected by diet. Here are some examples: Diets High in Calories. If you eat more calories than you burn, you'll gain weight. That's bad not only for your general health, but for your asthma specifically. People who are obese are more likely to have more severe asthma symptoms, take more medication, and miss more work than people who maintain a normal weight . Food Allergies . Many people have food intolerances such as lactose intolerance, but these are not true allergies and rarely worsen asthma. Only about 2% of adults with asthma have true food allergies to milk, eggs, shellfish, peanuts, or other foods. When exposed to even small amounts of the foods to which they have become allergic, these people can have life-threatening anaphylactic attacks, including bronchospasm, which requires immediate asthma medication. Preservative Sensitivities. Sulfites, which are used to keep food fresh and stop the growth of mold, can trigger temporary asthma symptoms in a few people with asthma. Sulfites can give off sulfur dioxide that can irritate the lungs. Sulfites are no longer added to fresh fruits and vegetables in the U. S. But they are still used in many processed foods, and may also be in condiments, dried fruits, canned vegetables, wine, and other foods. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder ( GERD). Up to 70% of all people with asthma also have GERD (reflux of stomach acid), which can make asthma more difficult to control. Sometimes, GERD doesn't cause typical heartburn symptoms. If you have GERD, you may need to take medicine. Weight loss is often all that is necessary to eliminate GERD. You should also try eating smaller meals and cutting down on alcohol, caffeine, and any foods that you notice trigger GERD symptoms. Avoid eating just before bedtime. There is no evidence that elimination of all dairy products from the diet improves asthma control, even in a minority of patients. That's simply a myth and can lead to osteoporosis, especially in patients who must regularly take corticosteroids to control their severe asthma. Before you make any big changes to your eating habits, it's always a good idea to talk to your health care provider or asthma specialist first. Depending on your asthma diagnosis -- and considering your general health and the severity of your asthma symptoms -- your health care provider might have specific advice for how to improve your diet."
470,"When you have lung cancer, you may notice that it even seems to affect your mouth. It could be dryer, or more sensitive, or painful, or have sores. Food might not even taste the way it usually does. Usually, those changes are related to the treatments, not the disease itself. But if your cancer spreads to your lymph nodes or other areas around your head or neck, it could cause problems like pain. No doubt about it: You need the lung cancer treatments. Every person is different -- you may or may not get the same side effects as someone else. If you do notice changes in your mouth or any other part of your body, work with your doctors to reduce or manage them. Some types of chemotherapy can affect your white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. That can affect your gums and the lining in your mouth. Likewise, certain kinds of radiation therapy can cause pain and stiffness, and even contribute to cavities in your teeth because of dry mouth. The top cause of lung cancer -- smoking -- may also be part of the problem. It raises your chance of getting conditions like gum disease (gingivitis) and mouth sores. If you quit tobacco, those problems become less likely, though they're still more likely than for a nonsmoker. When you get treated for cancer in your lungs or elsewhere in your body, you might have: Mouth sores. These can appear on the lining of your mouth and throat. They can make it hard to eat and drink. Dry mouth. This can make it hard to swallow and make you more likely to get infections and cavities. Bleeding or sensitive gums. Your doctor or dentist may call this gingivitis. Aches and pains in and around your jaw. Changes in the way food tastes. You might have less of an appetite, too, which can impact your ability to get enough healthy food. New cavities. Infections in your mouth. If you notice any of these things, tell your doctor, a nurse, or another member of your cancer care team. Although some of these side effects can be normal, they can sometimes be a sign that your treatment plan needs to change. Get a dental checkup before you start treatment for lung cancer. Don't delay your cancer care. But if it's possible, try to see your dentist at least a month ahead, in case your mouth needs time to recover from a dental procedure. Your dentist or periodontist should look at your teeth and gums. You may get dental X-rays, too. Exercise your jaw if you get radiation therapy. Three times a day, open and close your mouth as far as you can without feeling pain 20 times. This can help prevent and ease stiffness in your jaw muscles. Eat well. You may not have as much of an appetite when you're going through treatment. But try to keep eating healthy foods, which nourish your body. Skip spicy or acidic foods, and tobacco and alcohol, too. They can irritate sensitive tissues in your mouth. Suck on ice chips (don't chew them!) or sugar-free frozen pops during chemotherapy. These can ease mouth sores and dry mouth. Chomping on ice chips is really bad for your teeth and gums. Skip mouthwashes that contain alcohol, which can be drying. Look for an alcohol-free one that has fluoride. If you don't have any mouthwash, rinse with water regularly, which can clear your mouth and gums of food particles and bacteria. You may want to consider using a mix that has a quarter teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon salt in 1 quart of warm water. If you have mouth sores, rinse with plain warm water that has a little bit of salt in it. Your dentist can also prescribe a mouthwash that may help with sores. Gently brush your teeth, gums, and tongue after every meal, and before bed, too. If it hurts to brush, you can soften your toothbrush by soaking it in warm water before you use it. If toothpaste stings, brush with salt water -- add a quarter teaspoon of salt to 2 cups of water. Floss daily. If your gums are sore or bleed, ask your dentist if you should skip those areas. Most likely, you'll be able to keep flossing. Ask your dentist about using fluoride treatments to protect your teeth from cavities. Your dentist may make a tray for your teeth that you wear at night, or you may get a fluoride treatment at your next dental checkup. Keep your dentist up to date. She should know about your diagnosis and treatment plan, and see you for regular dental checkups throughout treatment. Talk to your cancer care team or cancer doctor about your dental health. Ask how treatment will affect your mouth and teeth, and what you should do now and later to stay healthy. You'll also want to confirm that it's safe to get dental care if you have teeth or gum problems."
471,"If your tonsils get infected once in a while, you usually can ride it out. But if you or your child get a lot of infections or they lead to other problems such as sleep apnea, you and your doctor might decide to take the tonsils out. Viruses or bacteria can cause tonsillitis. When you have it, you might get a sore throat and a fever. You may also notice your tonsils are red, swollen, and covered in a white or yellow coating. After the surgery, you can't get tonsillitis anymore. It can also help relieve sleeping problems and other issues caused by swollen tonsils. If you or your child need to have a doctor take them out, it helps to know how to get ready and what to expect. Along with the benefits of surgery, there are also some risks. For this kind of surgery, you'll get what's called general anesthesia, which makes you sleep through the operation so that you won't feel any pain while it's happening. Some people react to the drugs or gasses used for this. That's why your doctor will ask you lots of questions about your medical history. Other risks include: Bleeding. It's rare, but can happen and usually means you have to stay in the hospital longer. You may also have bleeding as you heal. Swelling. In the first few hours after surgery, your tongue and the roof of your mouth may puff up, which makes breathing harder. Infection. This is also rare, but it's a small risk with most surgeries. Your doctor will want to know about any medicines or supplements you take. This includes over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, as well as herbs and vitamins. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking certain medicines. For example, 2 weeks before surgery, you won't be able to take: Aspirin or any medicines that have aspirin Ginkgo biloba St. John's Wort Your doctor will also ask about: Reactions or allergies you have to medicines Problems that you or your family members have had with drugs used for anesthesia Bleeding problems that you or your family members have, such as issues with blood clotting Starting at midnight the night before the surgery, you won't be able to eat anything. You may be able to have some liquids, but check with your doctor to see what's allowed. If your child is having surgery, a few extra steps can go a long way to calm any concerns. You may want to: Ask your child questions so he can talk about his feelings, and you can make sure he's not confused about what's going to happen. Be very specific about how the surgery will help, telling him things such as âyou won't get sick as much or have as many sore throats.â Remind him that you'll be at the hospital the whole time. Talk about going to the hospital -- a good general rule is to talk 2 days ahead of time for a 2 year old, 3 days for a 3 year old, and so on. Tell your child that the doctor is taking just his tonsils out, nothing else, and he won't look any different. First, you'll get general anesthesia, so you won't be awake during the operation. To remove your tonsils, some doctors use a special knife called a scalpel. Other doctors prefer a tool that uses heat, sound waves (ultrasound), laser, or cold temperatures. They all work just as well, and your recovery time is the same with all of them. The surgery typically takes 20 to 45 minutes. After the surgery, you'll spend 2 to 4 hours in a recovery room before going home. As you wake up, you might feel sick to your stomach or even throw up. That's part of the anesthesia wearing off and is common. Young children may spend the night in the hospital. You might also spend the night if there were problems during the surgery or you have other health problems. It usually takes 10 to 14 days to heal. For adults, it might take a little longer. What to do for pain: The most common issue after surgery is pain. Almost everyone gets a sore throat. You may also hurt in your ear, neck, or jaw. Your doctor will let you know what medicines you can take for relief. What to eat and drink: One of the most important things you or your child can do for healing is to drink plenty of fluids. It can be hard with a sore throat, so you might want to start with water and popsicles. As far as eating, start with plain foods that are easy to swallow, such as applesauce. You can move on to ice cream and pudding as you work your way back to a normal diet. Physical activity: You need lots of rest even after minor surgery. Children and adults should delay any hard exercise, such as running, for 2 weeks. Generally, you're ready to get back to your typical routine when you can eat and drink as usual, sleep through the night, and don't need medicine for pain. Symptoms such as pain, snoring, and fever under 102 F are normal after surgery. But call your doctor if you notice these things: You feel weak, dizzy, lightheaded, or have a headache. This could mean you haven't had enough fluids. For your child: If's he's peeing only 2 to 3 times a day and crying without tears, that usually means he hasn't had enough to drink. You have a fever 102 F or higher. You throw up or still feel sick to your stomach more than 12 hours after surgery Go to the emergency room if you have: A hard time breathing Any bleeding (small bits of dark blood in your nose or spit are normal, but bright red blood means you need to be seen by a doctor.)"
472,"A plant-based diet can be good for your heart. If you're eating mostly or only fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, whole grains, and meat substitutes like soy, you may cut your odds of getting heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes, compared to a diet that includes a lot more meat. There are many different types of plant-based diets. The three most common ones are: Vegan : No animal products such as meat, eggs, or dairy products. Lacto-vegetarian: No meat or eggs, but dairy products are OK. Lacto-ovo-vegetarian: No meat, but dairy products and eggs are OK. You can eat a plant-based diet without going completely vegetarian. Some people call themselves ""flexitarians"" or ""semi-vegetarians,"" meaning that they occasionally eat meat, poultry, pork, or fish. You might also hear the term ""pescatarian,"" which means they eat a plant-based diet plus fish. Start eating more fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Depending on how far you want to take it, you can cut back on animal products, or cut them out. Check with a dietitian to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need. For example, you'll need to take a supplement or look for foods fortified with vitamin B12 if you totally cut out animal products. You'll also want to check on whether you're getting enough iron, calcium, and zinc. If you decide to swap dairy products for rice milk, nut milk, soy milk, or other plant-based alternatives, check the label to see how much calcium and vitamin D you're getting. To get enough protein without meat, favor beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, quinoa, or tofu. You'll still need to stick with your doctor's guidelines about fat, calories, sugar, and salt. It's possible to get too much of those whether you eat animal products or not."
473,"If you're seriously ill, you may have to manage not just your medical condition but physical, emotional, and practical matters as well. You may be in pain or too tired to get through the day. You and your loved ones may feel overwhelmed by endless decisions to make. A special kind of medicine called palliative care can help. It also goes by comfort or supportive care. Palliative doctors team up with your regular doctors to focus on symptoms like trouble breathing and stress. Unlike with hospice care, you can receive palliative care at any stage in your disease and continue to get treatments to cure it. Palliative medicine is a whole-person care that gives you an extra layer of support so you and your family can live better. Any adult or child can get it if they have a serious or ongoing condition, like: Cancer Heart failure Kidney or liver failure ALS ( Lou Gehrig's disease) HIV/ AIDS Multiple sclerosis Stroke Parkinson's disease Dementia Your team may include doctors, nurses, social workers, dietitians, volunteers, and even spiritual advisers. Its focus is not to treat or cure your disease, but to ease your symptoms and any side effects of treatment. These include: Pain Shortness of breath Fatigue Anxiety or depression Sleep problems Lack of appetite Constipation Your palliative care experts will ask what you may need and want. Maybe you'd like to feel well enough to leave the hospital or to move to the next step in your treatment. Or, you may want to get stronger so you can see your daughter play baseball or attend your son's wedding. Your team can help you reach those goals. The team can answer questions about treatment options, help you make decisions, and let your regular doctors know your wishes. You'll have more control over your overall care this way. The goals are the same for kids and adults: relieve pain and other symptoms. But children with serious illnesses aren't mini-adults -- they have their own specific needs. Some kids can't explain their pain or are too young to talk. Doctors and nurses trained in pediatric palliative medicine can help read your child's body language to figure out where and how much she hurts. Your child's team may also include: A child life therapist: This specialist helps your child understand her illness and provide a sense of normalcy so she can be a regular kid as much as possible. Art or music therapists: They work with your child to help her express feelings through art, music, poetry, or other creative outlets. The team can help you and your child with the emotions that go along with a serious illness. It can help you wade through the important health care decisions you'll have to make for your child, too. You don't have to be dying or have a terminal illness to get palliative care. You can start it as soon as you're diagnosed. If you get your symptoms under control early, you may be better able to get through the whole treatment. Hospice focuses on care, not cure. It's a specific type of palliative medicine for people who usually have 6 months or less to live and who have stopped treatments for their condition. If you feel palliative medicine might help you, ask for it if it's not offered. You can receive care at home, in the hospital, nursing home, or an assisted living center. Many private insurance plans pay for part of palliative medicine. Check with your insurer for specific benefits. This is separate from coverage for hospice care, which is often fully paid. If you have Medicare Part B (the Medicare plan that pays for doctor visits and outpatient care) or Medicaid, you may get some palliative coverage, depending on the treatment."
474,"Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) symptoms are different for each person who has this long-term disease. Some people have long periods with few or no symptoms. Others feel it for months at a time in an uptick of disease activity called a flare. Most people have persistent problems with episodes of worsening disease. New and earlier treatment is changing the overall picture, though. More people are having low disease activity or even remission. RA almost always affects your joints. It may take a few weeks or months for the first signs to show. The inflammation it causes results in classic symptoms like: Stiffness. The joint is harder to use and doesn't move as well as it should. It's especially common in the morning. While many people with other forms of arthritis have stiff joints in the morning, it takes people with rheumatoid arthritis more than an hour (sometimes several hours) before their joints feel loose. Swelling. Fluid in the joint makes it puffy and tender. Pain. Inflammation inside a joint makes it hurt whether you're moving it or not. Over time, it causes damage and pain. Redness and warmth. The joints may be warmer and show color changes related to the inflammation. RA usually starts in the hands, but it can affect any joint, including your: Elbows Feet Hips Jaw Knees Neck Shoulders Wrists If you have RA, you'll notice a symmetrical pattern. It shows up in the same joints on both sides of your body, like both wrists or both hips. It doesn't happen often, but RA can also affect a joint in your voice box. It can make your voice hoarse. Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms can go beyond your joints. You could also feel: Fatigue Muscle aches Poor appetite Bad all over (your doctor may call this malaise) Depression Extreme fatigue could be a sign of anemia, or a lack of healthy red blood cells. Your doctor will test for this as part of your RA diagnosis. Depression could also cause some of these symptoms. A chronic disease like RA can be hard to live with. Talk to your doctor if you think RA has you down. Some people with RA also get rheumatoid nodules. These are bumps under the skin. Most of the time they aren't painful and move easily when you touch them. Most often they appear on your elbows, but they might show up on other bony areas like: The underside of your forearm The back of your head The base of your spine Your Achilles tendon Tendons in your hand RA can damage your lungs or inflame the lining around them. This is called pleurisy. This may not cause symptoms. But you might notice shortness of breath. Your doctor can treat it with drugs that ease the inflammation in the lungs. Likewise, RA can inflame the lining around your heart (called pericarditis) or your heart muscle (called myocarditis). You probably wouldn't notice symptoms from that. There's a chance you could feel shortness of breath or chest pain. If you do, call your doctor. It can also raise your odds of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. The most common problems are: Cataracts: A clouding of the lens in your eye that affects your vision Dry eye syndrome: Whether it's medications or damage to your tear glands, your eyes can't make a healthy tear film. Scleritis: Inflammation and redness in the white part of your eye Bones: The chemicals that cause inflammation can also take a bite out of your bones. It often affects your hips and spine. Sometimes it's a byproduct of years of treating RA with steroids. Liver and kidneys: It's rare for RA to affect these organs. But the drugs that treat it can. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) and are bad for both. Cyclosporine can cause kidney disease. Methotrexate can damage your liver. Immune system: The medications you take can slow it down. This makes you more likely to get infections. Mucous membranes: You might be more likely to get a condition called Sjogren's syndrome that dries out moist places in your body like your eyes, mouth, and inside your nose. Muscles: When inflammation stops you from moving your joints, the attached muscles can get weak. Or you could get a condition called myositis that weakens them. The medications you take for RA can also be to blame. Nerves: RA causes symptoms that range from numbness and tingling to paralysis and sudden death. It can result from joint damage that RA causes, the disease process itself, or medications that treat it. Blood vessels: RA can cause inflammation of your blood vessels. It shows up as spots on the skin that look like ulcers."
475,"There are many different medications to treat ADHD, and finding the exact formula and dosage for your child can take some detective work. Your doctor may prescribe your child a low dose of a medicine, then raise it little by little until your child gets the greatest benefit with the fewest side effects. This is called titration. It can take several weeks. And don't be discouraged if the first medicine your child takes isn't the right fit. The doctor may try titration with two or three different types of medicine before finding the best match. Most of the side effects from these medications last for a short time as your child adjusts to the drug. Common side effects include sleeping problems, appetite loss, and not feeling as social. These often go away after a few weeks, so your doctor may encourage you to wait it out and see if they get better on their own. If they don't, your doctor can adjust the dosage or change the medication. Less common but more serious side effects can include hallucinations, tics, and depression. You may want to start during the weekend or over a school break so you can keep a close eye on your child for the first few days. You can also use this time to figure out the best time to take the medicine. For example, a younger child may need to take the medicine in the morning to focus throughout the school day, and a teen may need a stronger dose later in the afternoon to get through homework or to focus while driving home. What works at first may not continue to over time. Watch your child for symptoms and side effects as he grows and his schedule and lifestyle change. Check in with the doctor every 3 months or so to make sure your child is still on the right treatment."
476,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men in the United States. But thanks to many new life-saving treatments, heart attacks don't have to be fatal â- sometimes, they don't even slow you down too much. The trick is to know the signs and get help right away. Symptoms can vary from person to person and even from one episode to another in the same person. Some come on suddenly, and others give plenty of warning. Still, there are some common signs of heart attacks in men. This is the most common symptom of a heart attack in both men and women. Most often, it starts slowly with mild pain or discomfort. A sudden onset of severe symptoms is sometimes called a â Hollywood heart attack,â because of the typical way heart attacks have been portrayed in movies and television. A heart attack can happen this way, but it doesn't that often. The pain can be severe, but it doesn't have to be. It can be a feeling of âfullness,â squeezing, or pressure. It can even be mistaken for heartburn. The discomfort often happens in the left or center of your chest. The feeling may last for more than several minutes, or it may come and go. Pain or discomfort sometimes shows up in other areas because they're not getting enough blood. Usually, it's an area of the body that's above the waist, including the upper part of your stomach, your shoulders, one arm (probably the left) or both, your back, neck or jaw, even your teeth. Shortness of breath, called dyspnea, can happen with or without chest pain and may even be your only symptom. It can happen when you're being active or not and is probably due to congestion (fluid buildup) in your lungs. You may also find yourself coughing or wheezing. Feeling tired for no reason is another common sign. You might feel anxious, too. Nausea and vomiting are less common in men than women. Some people say they feel light-headed or dizzy. Another possible sign is breaking into a cold sweat The more symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack. But bear in mind, you may have no symptoms at all. These are called silent heart attacks and are more common the older you are or if you have diabetes. If you think there's any possibility that you're having a heart attack, call 911 right away."
477,"ADEM is a rare kind of inflammation that affects the brain and spinal cord. It damages the protective coating of nerve fibers, called myelin. Most often, children under age 10 will get it. While symptoms can be severe, they can be treated. Most people make a full recovery and don't have another attack. ADEM comes on suddenly and gets worse fast. When their myelin is damaged, nerves can't pass signals correctly. That can cause muscle weakness and problems with balance and moving smoothly. You may have trouble seeing if ADEM attacks the myelin on the optic nerve, which sends signals from your eyes to your brain. Other symptoms include: Fever Headache Sleepiness Behavior changes such as fussiness or confusion Nausea and vomiting Seizures Coma ADEM seems to be an autoimmune disease. That means your immune system attacks your body's own cells and tissues as if they were outside bacteria or viruses. Experts don't know exactly what triggers it, but it could be an overreaction to an infection. Most of the time, the attack happens when a child is getting over some common illness, like a cold or stomach bug. ADEM sometimes follows an immunization, particularly certain rabies shots and the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. No direct connection has been made though. Other times, nothing out of the ordinary happens before symptoms appear. No one test proves you have ADEM, but doctors most often use MRI (pictures of the brain made with a large magnet and radio waves) and a lumbar puncture (fluid drawn from around the spinal cord and then tested) to help diagnose it. The condition has a lot in common with multiple sclerosis and other diseases that damage myelin. They share some symptoms, like muscle weakness, numbness, loss of vision, and loss of balance. But MS is rare in children. Other differences can also help your doctor make the right diagnosis. Kids with ADEM may have a fever, a headache, seizures, or trouble thinking clearly. The disease usually appears soon after a viral illness. There's no such link with MS. An ADEM attack usually happens once, while multiple sclerosis involves many episodes over time. Tests of spinal fluid usually show certain proteins when you have MS, but not ADEM. With ADEM, spinal fluid usually has more white blood cells than normal. Damage to the brain from ADEM and damage caused by multiple sclerosis look different on an MRI. It's more widespread with ADEM. The doctor has to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms, too, like infections of the brain and spinal cord such as meningitis. The goal is to get the inflammation down quickly and stop the immune system attack. This will likely take a week or two in the hospital. Most people start with high doses of a powerful corticosteroid by IV for a few days. Your child may feel better within hours. They'll continue to take a steroid (as a pill or a liquid) for several weeks, in smaller and smaller doses. If your child can't have steroids or if they don't work, some procedures can calm the immune system. The doctor may filter their blood through a machine to remove the antibodies that their immune system is sending to attack the brain. This is called plasmapheresis. Or they could get shots of antibodies from a healthy person, which is called intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. After the hospital, they may need some combination of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They may have to stay in a rehab hospital for a while, or maybe they can go home and work with a therapist. Your child's doctor will probably want a follow-up MRI to make sure the inflammation is gone and no new scars have formed. Most of the time, a child who gets ADEM will recover completely. It will be a slow process, over 4 to 6 weeks. But it could be 6 months or up to a year before they're fully well. In some cases, kids don't get over all of their symptoms. They may have lasting vision damage or muscle weakness. They might have trouble in school if they've missed a lot of time, or perhaps as a lingering effect of the attack. About 8 times out of 10, ADEM happens only once. But sometimes you can get it again within a few months, especially if you don't take steroids for long enough. Your child might get MS later, but it's unlikely. In very rare cases, ADEM can be fatal."
478,"Cancer is defined as the uncontrollable growth of cells that invade and cause damage to surrounding tissue. Oral cancer appears as a growth or sore in the mouth that does not go away. Oral cancer, which includes cancers of the lips, tongue, cheeks, floor of the mouth, hard and soft palate, sinuses, and pharynx (throat), can be life threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. The most common symptoms of oral cancer include: Swellings/thickenings, lumps or bumps, rough spots/crusts/or eroded areas on the lips, gums, or other areas inside the mouth The development of velvety white, red, or speckled (white and red) patches in the mouth $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); Unexplained bleeding in the mouth Unexplained numbness, loss of feeling, or pain/tenderness in any area of the face, mouth, or neck Persistent sores on the face, neck, or mouth that bleed easily and do not heal within 2 weeks A soreness or feeling that something is caught in the back of the throat Difficulty chewing or swallowing, speaking, or moving the jaw or tongue Hoarseness, chronic sore throat, or change in voice Ear pain A change in the way your teeth or dentures fit together Dramatic weight loss If you notice any of these changes, contact your dentist or health care professional immediately. According to the American Cancer Society, men face twice the risk of developing oral cancer as women, and men who are over age 50 face the greatest risk. It's estimated that over 50,000 people in the U. S. received a diagnosis of oral cancer in 2019. Risk factors for the development of oral cancer include: Smoking . Cigarette, cigar, or pipe smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop oral cancers. Smokeless tobacco users. Users of dip, snuff, or chewing tobacco products are 50 times more likely to develop cancers of the cheek, gums, and lining of the lips. Excessive consumption of alcohol. Oral cancers are about six times more common in drinkers than in nondrinkers. Family history of cancer. Excessive sun exposure, especially at a young age. Human papillomavirus ( HPV). Certain HPV strains are etiologic risk factors for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( OSCC). It is important to note that over 25% of all oral cancers occur in people who do not smoke and who only drink alcohol occasionally. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with an early diagnosis of oral cavity and pharynx cancers is 84%. If the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, organs, or lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate drops to 65%. As part of your routine dental exam, your dentist will conduct an oral cancer screening exam. More specifically, your dentist will feel for any lumps or irregular tissue changes in your neck, head, face, and oral cavity. When examining your mouth, your dentist will look for any sores or discolored tissue as well as check for any signs and symptoms mentioned above. A biopsy may be needed to determine the makeup of a suspicious looking area. There are different types of biopsies and your doctor can determine which one is best. Many doctors don't use brush biopsies because while they're very easy, they still need a scalpel biopsy to confirm the results if the brush biopsy is positive. Also there are different types of scalpel biopsies, incisional and excisional, depending whether only a piece or the whole area is needed to determine what the nature of the problem is. Some doctors perform these biopsies with lasers. Oral cancer is treated the same way many other cancers are treated -- with surgery to remove the cancerous growth, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (drug treatments) to destroy any remaining cancer cells. To prevent oral cancer: Don't smoke or use any tobacco products and drink alcohol in moderation (and refrain from binge drinking). Eat a well balanced diet. Limit your exposure to the sun. Repeated exposure increases the risk of cancer on the lip, especially the lower lip. When in the sun, use UV- A/ B-blocking sun protective lotions on your skin, as well as your lips. You can take an active role in detecting oral cancer early, should it occur, by doing the following: Conduct a self exam at least once a month. Using a bright light and a mirror, look and feel your lips and front of your gums. Tilt your head back and look at and feel the roof of your mouth. Pull your checks out to view the inside of your mouth, the lining of your cheeks, and the back gums. Pull out your tongue and look at all surfaces; examine the floor of your mouth. Look at the back of your throat. Feel for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of your neck and under your lower jaw. Call your dentist's office immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of your mouth or any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above. See your dentist on a regular schedule. Even though you may be conducting frequent self exams, sometimes dangerous spots or sores in the mouth can be very tiny and difficult to see on your own. The American Cancer Society recommends oral cancer screening exams every 3 years for persons over age 20 and annually for those over age 40. During your next dental appointment, ask your dentist to perform an oral exam. Early detection can improve the chance of successful treatment."
479,"If you feel winded without even breaking a sweat, heart or lung disease could be to blame, but they're not the only causes. Some health problems that don't seem related to your lungs can make it hard to breathe. Red blood cells help carry oxygen throughout your body. Iron is key to this process, but sometimes you don't get enough in your food or your body has trouble absorbing it. This can lead to a condition called anemia. Warning signs: Besides shortness of breath and chest pain, you may feel tired, weak, and dizzy. Some people get pale skin and cold hands and feet. What helps? Your doctor may suggest you eat more iron-rich foods (lean meats, beans, dark leafy greens), take supplements, or get more vitamin C, which helps your body absorb more iron. People with severe anemia may need a transfusion of red blood cells. When you're stressed or worried, the muscles that help you breathe tighten. This makes you breathe faster than normal. You may feel like you're not getting enough air, which can make you panic and make your breathing even shallower. Warning signs: Sweating, chest pain, feeling faint. Some people feel like they have a lump in their throat. What helps? Try to stay calm. Sit or lie down and relax your shoulders as much as you can. Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, and out through pursed lips (like you're blowing out a candle) for 8. This can help bring your breath back to normal. Pollen, mold, and other allergens do more than cause itchy eyes and a runny nose. They can also irritate the airways in your lungs. This can trigger an asthma attack and make it hard for you to take normal breaths. Warning signs: Coughing, wheezing, chest tightness. Symptoms may last a few minutes or several days. What helps? An inhaler can reduce swelling in your airways right away. Long-term medicines will stop you from reacting as much to your allergy triggers. If germs come into your body through your nose and mouth, they can travel to your lungs and cause an infection. This is called pneumonia. Anyone can get it, but you're at higher risk if your immune system is weak, you have a lung disease like asthma, or you smoke. Warning signs: Chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain. You may also bring up thick mucus when you cough. What helps? The problem usually gets better with antibiotics. But some people need to go into the hospital for treatments that help their lungs fully heal. You can catch this parasite by walking barefoot through infected soil or by drinking or eating food that has hookworm eggs in it. Once hookworms get inside you, they grow in your intestines and feed on your blood. Over time, that makes your body have fewer red blood cells. Warning signs: Weakness, feeling tired, stomach pain, diarrhea, weight loss. If a child has hookworm, their physical and mental growth may be slowed. What helps? Hookworms are easy to treat. Your doctor will prescribe a few days of medicine that gets rid of the worms. It's a problem with your immune system, called an autoimmune disorder. It prevents your nerves and muscles from âtalkingâ to each other like they should. As a result, the muscles throughout your body get weak. Warning signs: Many people first show symptoms of it in their eyes. You may notice a drooping eyelid or double vision. Other signs may be trouble with speaking, swallowing, or smiling, feeling tired, and weakness in your arms and legs. What helps? For a few people, symptoms go away on their own. But most need drugs to get your nerves and muscles âtalkingâ again. Some people feel better if doctors remove their thymus gland, a central part of the immune system. Some types of cancer cause fluid to build up in the space between your lungs and chest wall. This can make it painful to take a deep breath. Warning signs: Feeling like there's a weight on your chest, coughing, fever. You may also feel rundown and tired. What helps: Your doctor could prescribe a drug that eases swelling or helps your body get rid of extra fluid. In some cases, he'll need to remove the fluid and treat the area so it doesn't fill again."
480,"It is no secret that a good night's sleep makes you feel better. Not only does sleep give your body time to rest and recharge, it may also be crucial to your brain's ability to learn and remember. During sleep, while your body rests, your brain is busy processing information from the day and forming memories. If you are sleep deprived, you are at risk of developing a number of serious health problems, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, and your ability to learn and retain new information may be impaired. This may not be news to anyone who has pulled an all-nighter cramming for a test only to find the facts and figures they knew at 2 a.m. could not be recalled the next day. Without adequate sleep, your brain becomes foggy, your judgment poor, and your fine motor skills hindered. Imaging and behavioral studies continue to show the critical role sleep plays in learning and memory. Researchers believe that sleep affects learning and memory in two ways: Lack of sleep impairs a person's ability to focus and learn efficiently. Sleep is necessary to consolidate a memory (make it stick) so that it can be recalled in the future. There are different types of memories. Some are fact-based, such as remembering the name of state capitals. Some are episodic -- based on events in your life, such as your first kiss. And some memories are procedural or instructional, such as how to ride a bike or play the piano. For something to become a memory, three functions must occur, including: Acquisition -- learning or experiencing something new Consolidation -- the memory becomes stable in the brain Recall -- having the ability to access the memory in the future Both acquisition and recall are functions that take place when you are awake. However, researchers believe sleep is required for consolidation of a memory, no matter the memory type. Without adequate sleep, your brain has a harder time absorbing and recalling new information. Sleep does more than help sharpen the mind. Studies show that sleep affects physical reflexes, fine motor skills, and judgment, too. One study showed that participants who were sleep deprived were more likely to think they were right when they were, in fact, wrong. Studies involving memory tests show that after a single night of sleep, or even a nap, people perform better, whether on a test, in the office, on the athletic field, or in a concert hall. Scientists don't know exactly how sleep enhances memory, but it appears to involve the brain's hippocampus and neocortex -- the part of the brain where long-term memories are stored. It is thought that during sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, where it reviews and processes memories, helping them to last for the long term. Researchers continue to investigate the stages of sleep involved in making certain types of memories. Some studies have shown that certain kinds of memories become stable during rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep -- the time when you dream. Other studies have found that some types of memories are most often secured during slow-wave, deep sleep. Scientists are getting closer to understanding what sleep does to our brain, but there are still many questions to be answered. What's certain is that sleep is a biological necessity -- we need it to survive. Unfortunately, in this day and age, few of us are able to get the sleep we need to function our best. Experts recommend adults get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Although this may not be attainable every night, it should be the goal. Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Get regular exercise, but do not exercise close to bedtime. Experts recommend allowing at least three hours between exercise and bed. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before going to sleep. Take time to unwind before going to sleep. Take a warm bath, read a book, drink some caffeine-free tea, and avoid any activities that can cause tension. Finish eating two to three hours before going to bed. Create a pleasant sleeping environment: make the room dark, cool, and comfortable. Use a sound machine, or other type of white noise device, to block out unwanted sounds. Do not watch TV or use the computer in bed. Use your bedroom for sleep and sex only. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including getting regular and quality sleep, can be a challenge, especially when you are stressed with a work deadline or test. But, remember (and you need sleep to do this! ), sleep is your friend. So, when it comes to learning and memory, sleep on it."
481,"Starting a family requires a bit more planning when you're a mother-to-be with diabetes. But you can take some simple steps to make sure your pregnancy and your baby are safe and healthy. One of your first tasks should be to set up an appointment about 3 to 6 months before you plan to conceive. At that visit, your doctor will: Order an A1 C test to find out if your diabetes is controlled well enough for you to stop using birth control Test your blood and urine for diabetes-related kidney complications Look for other problems linked with diabetes, like organ, nerve, or heart damage Take your blood pressure Rule out thyroid disease (if you have type 1 diabetes) Check your cholesterol and levels of a type of blood fat called triglycerides Suggest an eye exam to screen for glaucoma, cataracts, and retinopathy Recommend pre-conception counseling This is another important step for women with diabetes. This educational session will help you get physically and emotionally prepared -- and healthy -- for pregnancy. At this appointment, you and the doctor will discuss: Your weight: Try to reach your ideal body weight before you get pregnant. If you have a few extra pounds, losing them will help prevent complications from diabetes. If you're underweight, adding pounds can make you less likely to deliver a low-birth-weight baby. Your lifestyle: If you smoke or drink alcohol, you'll need to stop. Smoking during pregnancy affects both you and the baby before, during, and after birth. When you smoke, the nicotine (the addictive substance in cigarettes), carbon monoxide, and other toxins travel through your bloodstream and go directly to your baby. These substances can: Deprive you and the baby of oxygen Raise the baby's heart rate Boost the chances of miscarriage and stillbirth Increase the odds of a premature, low-birth-weight baby Make the baby prone to future problems with the lungs or breathing Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a pattern of birth defects that includes intellectual disability and certain physical problems. No amount of alcohol is known to be safe while pregnant, and there's no safe time during pregnancy to drink. Prenatal vitamins: At least one month before you get pregnant, start taking a daily vitamin that has folic acid. It's been shown to lower the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect like spina bifida, a serious condition in which the brain and spinal cord don't form normally. The CDC recommends you take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily before conception and throughout pregnancy. Most drugstores sell over-the-counter prenatal vitamins that don't require a prescription. Your blood sugar: The doctor will check to see if your blood sugar is in control. This is key, because you may not know you're pregnant until the baby has been growing for 2-4 weeks. High blood sugar during the first 13 weeks can cause birth defects, lead to miscarriage, and put you at risk for diabetes complications. Your medications: You'll need more insulin during pregnancy, especially the last 3 months. The doctor will tell you how to adjust your dose. If you take diabetes pills, the doctor may switch you to insulin, because some of these drugs can harm the baby. So can some high blood pressure treatments used with diabetes. Bottom line: Discuss all medications you take with your doctor. Meal planning: You'll need to make some changes while you're pregnant to avoid swings in blood sugar levels. You'll also need to take in more calories to feed your growing baby."
482,"Whether you had diabetes before you got pregnant or you developed diabetes during your pregnancy, you'll need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels. Tight control will help you avoid complications and long-term health problems for both you and your baby. You're eating differently because your body needs more energy to help your baby grow and be healthy. And your changing hormones affect how your body makes and uses insulin. In the later parts of your pregnancy, you may become more insulin resistant, so blood sugar builds up to higher levels. How often should you check your blood sugar? Pre-existing diabetes: Before and after meals and before bedtime Gestational diabetes: Before breakfast and after every meal; your doctor can tell you how long after eating you should check. If you are pregnant and have type 1 diabetes, your doctor might sometimes ask you to check your blood sugar in the middle of the night, around 3 a.m. Your doctor may recommend that you check your fasting urine ketones on a regular basis, as well. For every type of diabetes, if you're pregant you need to see your doctor at least once a month, perhaps as often as once a week."
483,"It's all about light. Light reflects off an object, and if that object is in your field of vision, it enters the eye. The first thing it touches is a thin veil of tears in the front. Behind this is your eye's front window, the cornea. This clear layer helps focus the light. On the other side is liquid called the aqueous humor. It circulates throughout the front part of your eye and keeps pressure inside constant After the aqueous humor, light passes through the pupil. This is the central round opening in your iris, the colored part of your eye. It changes size to control how much light gets in farther back. Next up is the lens. It works just like a camera to focus light. It adjusts shape depending on whether the light reflects off something near to you or far away. This light now pierces the center of the eye. It's bathed in moisture from a clear jelly known as the vitreous. Its final destination is the retina, which lines the back of your eye. It's like the screen in a movie theater or the film in a camera. The focused light hits cells called photoreceptors. Unlike a movie screen, the retina has many parts: Blood vessels bring nutrients to your nerve cells. The macula is the bull's-eye at the center of your retina. The dead center is called the fovea. Because it's the focal point of your eye, it has more special, light-sensitive nerve endings, called photoreceptors, than any other part. Photoreceptors come in two kinds: rods and cones. They're special nerve endings that convert the light into electrochemical signals. Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) is a layer of dark tissue beneath the photoreceptors. These cells absorb excess light so the photoreceptors can give a clearer signal. They also move nutrients to (and waste from) the photoreceptors to the choroid. The choroid is separate from the RPE. It lies behind the retina and is made up of many fine blood vessels that supply nutrition to the retina and the RPE. Sclera is the tough, white, fibrous outside wall of your eye. It's connected to the clear cornea in front. It protects the delicate structures inside the eye. Signals from the photoreceptors travel along nerve fibers to the optic nerve. It sends the signals to the visual center in the back of the brain. And that's how you see: Light, reflected from an object, enters the eye, gets focused, is converted into electrochemical signals, delivered to the brain, and is interpreted, or ""seen,"" as an image."
484," Declining estrogen levels associated with menopause can cause more than those pesky hot flashes. They can also make a woman feel like she is in a constant state of PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Unfortunately, these emotional changes are a normal part of menopause. Some of the emotional changes experienced by women undergoing perimenopause or menopause can include: Irritability Feelings of sadness Lack of motivation Anxiety Aggressiveness Difficulty concentrating Fatigue Mood changes Tension If you are feeling irritable and sad, there is a good chance it could be related to menopause, but the above listed symptoms are not linked only to menopause. There are a number of conditions that can cause you to feel downright irritable. Tell your doctor how you are feeling, so he or she can rule out other medical or psychiatric conditions. Irritability and feelings of sadness are the most common emotional symptoms of menopause. Often, they can be managed through lifestyle changes, such as learning ways to relax and reduce stress. Here are some tips that may make it easier for you to handle your fluctuating emotions: Exercise and eat healthy. Find a self-calming skill to practice, such as yoga, meditation, or rhythmic breathing. Avoid tranquilizers and alcohol. Engage in a creative outlet that fosters a sense of achievement. Stay connected with your family and community. Nurture your friendships. Although depression is not caused by menopause, some women exhibit the symptoms of depression during this time. If you are feeling increasingly unable to cope, see your doctor. He or she may be able to recommend medicine, such as antidepressants, or therapy that can get you through this rough time. While there is growing evidence to suggest that hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) can relieve emotional symptoms linked to menopause, HRT alone is not effective in treating more severe depression. Antidepressant drug therapy and/or psychotherapy may be necessary. Unfortunately, difficulty with concentration and minor memory problems can often be a normal part of perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause (defined as not having a period for a year). The good news is that it is likely to be temporary. Current medical knowledge is limited as to why memory changes occur with perimenopause, and there are currently no treatments available to relieve these symptoms. If you are having memory problems, discuss this with your doctor. He or she can help manage memory problems or refer you to a provider who can."
485,"Headache specialists are still unraveling the mysteries of migraine and other headaches. Most believe a combination of factors, from genetics to neurovascular imbalances in the brain, play a role. But what role could weather play? One leading evolutionary theory is that getting a headache is a protective mechanism against adverse environmental stressors. The theory goes that headache pain would cause someone to seek a safer, more hospitable environment. The fact that changes in weather and extremes in heat and cold cause headache, some experts believe, gives credence to this theory. In a survey by the National Headache Foundation, headache sufferers were given a list of 16 possible triggers. They then were asked to rank them in terms of what commonly brought on their migraines and other headaches. Three out of every four respondents said that weather triggered their headache pain. Specific weather triggers include: Changes in humidity Changes in temperature Storms Extremely dry conditions Dusty environments Listed below are common environmental triggers for headaches included in the survey and the percentage of people who identified them as triggers. People often have more than one type of trigger for their headaches. How many, if any, of these factors trigger your headaches? Weather or barometric pressure changes: 73% Intense odors: 64% Bright or flickering lights: 59% Smoke: 53% Extreme heat or cold: 38% Altitude changes: 31% High winds: 18% Most of the participants reported that these environmental triggers have kept them from participating in their normal outdoor activities. They also said they'd stayed away from places likely to have smoke in the air, such as restaurants or bars. As noted earlier, there is a theory that headaches triggered by extreme weather are a protective, or defensive, response because they lead the person to seek a more hospitable environment. Experts believe that people who get frequent headaches have a greater sensitivity to changes in the environment. They also have a lower threshold to the pain response. The reason, they suspect, is that people who get migraine headaches have likely inherited this sensitivity. The survey cited earlier also found that two out of three headache sufferers had not discussed environmental triggers with their doctors. Nearly half of them, though, had been plagued by headaches for more than 20 years. Keeping a headache or migraine diary is the first step toward keeping pain from disrupting your life. Some people have clear signs that a migraine headache is coming. And they may get these warnings as early as 48 hours before the headache strikes. These early warning signs are called ""prodromal,"" meaning precursory. Possible signs include: Irritability Depression Frequent yawning Feeling especially excitable If headaches plague you, keep a daily headache diary. That way you can look back a day or two before a headache starts for signs of what may have triggered your headache. Record any irritability or other prodromal signs. Also, if you think weather is a factor, record any of the common weather and environmental triggers listed above. Keep a detailed diary for three months to allow the variable patterns of your headaches to show up. In your headache diary, write the following: Your headache symptoms: where you feel the pain, what the pain feels like, and any other symptoms, such as vomiting or sensitivity to noise, smells, or bright light The time your headache started and ended Any food and beverages you had (common triggers include chocolate, caffeine, and foods with the preservatives MSG and nitrates) Any changes in the weather, such as storms, high winds, or high humidity Any treatment you tried, and whether it helped or made the headache worse Some experts believe that people link their headaches to weather more than is actually true. That opinion is based on a 2004 study that analyzed patients' perceived headache patterns with actual National Weather Service data. But those same experts would agree that headache is still somewhat of a mystery. They also point out that headaches are as individual as they are unpredictable. The only way to know for sure if weather is a factor for you is to find out for yourself. And the only way to do that is with a detailed headache diary. You can't change the weather. But you may be better able to plan around it and keep your headaches at bay."
486," It may surprise you to know that men don't have a monopoly on testosterone. Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones called androgens. But women also have testosterone. The ovaries produce both testosterone and estrogen. Relatively small quantities of testosterone are released into your bloodstream by the ovaries and adrenal glands. In addition to being produced by the ovaries, estrogen is also produced by the body's fat tissue. These sex hormones are involved in the growth, maintenance, and repair of reproductive tissues. But that's not all. They also influence other body tissues and bone mass. A hormone is a chemical substance. It's secreted by one tissue and travels by way of body fluids to affect another tissue in your body. In essence, hormones are ""chemical messengers."" Many hormones, especially those affecting growth and behavior, are significant to both men and women. The amount and levels of hormones change daily. The sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone, are secreted in short bursts -- pulses -- which vary from hour to hour and even minute to minute. Hormone release varies between night and day and from one stage of the menstrual cycle to another. Estrogen is an entire class of related hormones that includes estriol, estradiol, and estrone. Estriol is made from the placenta. It's produced during pregnancy. Estradiol is the primary sex hormone of childbearing women. It is formed from developing ovarian follicles. Estradiol is responsible for female characteristics and sexual functioning. Also, estradiol is important to women's bone health. Estradiol contributes to most gynecologic problems, including endometriosis and fibroids and even female cancers. Estrone is widespread throughout the body. It is the main estrogen present after menopause. There are many reasons why estrogen levels fall, including: Hypogonadism Hypopituitarism Pregnancy failure (estriol) Perimenopause and menopause (estradiol) Polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS) Anorexia nervosa (eating disorder) Extreme exercise or training Drugs that block estrogen include clomiphene, which tricks the body into thinking it has decreased levels of estrogen. Also, women experience low levels of estrogen immediately after childbirth and also during breastfeeding. Women with low body fat often do not produce sufficient amounts of sex hormones. This can be a problem for women such as athletes, models, and gymnasts. It can also be a problem for women with eating disorders. These women can experience a cessation of menstruation, known as amenorrhea. They may also develop osteoporosis -- thin bones -- and fractures as well as other conditions more common in older women after menopause. Yes. Estrogen levels fall at menopause. This is a natural transition for all women between ages 40 and 55. The decline in estrogen can happen abruptly in younger women whose ovaries are removed, resulting in so-called surgical menopause. Perimenopause is the period of transition before menopause. The first natural decline in estrogen levels starts during this phase. Other physiological changes also start. Women going through perimenopause may experience weight gain along with other menopause symptoms. For instance, there may be irregular menstrual periods, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness. On average, menopause occurs at age 51. When it does, a woman's body produces less estrogen and progesterone. The drop of estrogen levels at menopause can cause uncomfortable symptoms, including: Hot flashes Night sweats Vaginal dryness or itching Loss of libido or sex drive Some women experience moodiness. That may or may not be related to the loss of estrogen. Lower levels of estrogen may also increase a woman's risk for heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis and fractures. During puberty, it's normal for levels of estrogen to rise. That's because this hormone fuels changes in a young girl's body. For example, it plays a role in the development of breasts, a more mature curved figure, fuller hips, and pubic and underarm hair. In addition, high levels of estrogen are seen in women who are extremely overweight. Estrogen levels rise during a healthy pregnancy, and increased estrogen levels may be seen with tumors of the ovaries, testes, or adrenal glands. Some drugs, such as steroid medications, ampicillin, estrogen-containing drugs, phenothiazines, and tetracyclines can increase estrogen levels. If your body produces too much testosterone, you may have irregular or absent menstrual periods. You may also have more body hair than the average woman. Some women with high testosterone levels develop frontal balding. Other possible effects include acne, an enlarged clitoris, increased muscle mass, and deepening of voice. High levels of testosterone can also lead to infertility and are commonly seen in polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS). PCOS is an endocrine condition that is sometimes seen in women of childbearing age who have difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS have symptoms similar to those produced by high testosterone levels. They include: Obesity An apple-shaped body Excessive or thinning hair Acne Menstrual irregularity PCOS is associated with: Higher levels of circulating male hormones Insulin resistance Carbohydrate intolerance -- conditions that make you prone to gaining weight Low levels of HDL -- ''good'' -- cholesterol Elevated triglycerides High LDL -- ''bad'' -- cholesterol Obesity High blood pressure As women with PCOS age, the presence of these risk factors increases their risk for heart disease. At menopause, women experience a decline in testosterone. That decline may be correlated to a reduced libido. Some findings indicate that testosterone replacement therapy may benefit sexual function in certain perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Testosterone replacement is unadvised in women with breast or uterine cancer. It also may increase the chances of cardiovascular disease or liver disease. So, experts are cautious about recommendations. Your doctor can do a physical examination and assess your health situation and symptoms to determine if further laboratory tests are needed to check hormone levels. Those tests may be important if you have a health condition such as PCOS or have stopped menstruating because of excessive athletic training or anorexia nervosa. If the tests show abnormal levels of hormones, your doctor can prescribe effective treatment."
487,"Migraine headaches are tough, but you can learn ways to manage them. From medications, to alternative treatments, to new methods to ease stress and relax, try these tips to keep the pain at bay. Follow your migraine treatment plan. Don't take medications your doctor didn't order. Relieve emotional stress. Take time to unwind and step away from stressful situations. Learn skills that can calm you, like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Lower physical stress. Proper rest and sleep will help you relax and face a new day. If you sit for long stretches of time, get up and move around often. Relax your jaw, neck, and shoulders. Exercise regularly. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. Keep a routine. Eat meals and snacks at about the same times during the day. Go to bed and wake up on a set schedule. Quit smoking. It can bring on migraine headaches and make any headache, especially cluster headaches, worse. Ask your doctor how to stop. Know your triggers. Keep a diary to learn what sets off your headaches. Avoid these things when possible. Practice prevention. If you get headaches around your menstrual period, take preventive medication when your time of the month is near. Your doctor may also prescribe it if your headaches happen often or are severe. You can also reach out to organizations and support groups that may be able to help. Other people with migraine headaches can offer other tips on how to deal with your symptoms. See if you can find some that meet in your area or online."
488," If you've been smoking for a while, you might wonder if quitting's even worth it. Maybe the cravings and nicotine withdrawal just turn you off to the whole idea. You wonder, "" The damage is done, so does it really make a difference?"" Absolutely. Your body has an amazing ability to heal itself, and it happens quicker than you think -- less than half an hour after you put out that last cigarette. And keep in mind, you're more likely to succeed if you have a plan to handle those cravings, especially in the first few weeks. In less time than it takes to watch a sitcom, your body's already getting better. After 20 minutes, your pulse and blood pressure start to drop back to normal. And your hands and feet warm up to their usual temperature. By the end of a work day, you have half the amount of nicotine and carbon monoxide in your blood. Why does that matter? Carbon monoxide is a chemical in cigarettes, and it crowds out oxygen in your blood. That causes problems from your muscles to your brain because they don't get the oxygen they need. But as the chemical's levels drop, your oxygen gets back to normal. On the flip side, it's likely you already feel some early cravings and doubts. That's normal. But they usually last just 5-10 minutes. To get you through, try to find ways to distract yourself until the feeling passes. You could try making a craving playlist, chewing gum, or sipping water. Halfway through your first day, your carbon monoxide level is back to normal. And your heart will thank you. Now it doesn't have to pump so hard to try to get enough oxygen to your body. If you smoke a pack a day, you're twice as likely to have a heart attack as a nonsmoker. But go one full day without a cigarette, and you've lowered your chances. That's huge. With 2 days down, treat yourself to something tasty. By this point, your senses of taste and smell get sharper as your nerve endings start to heal. Your body's also busy with a lot of cleanup. Your lungs kick out mucus and other gunk left from cigarettes. And you don't have any more nicotine in your body. This is also about the time when the toughest withdrawal symptoms show up. You might feel anxious, dizzy, hungry, or tired. You might get headaches or feel bored or depressed. It's normal, but it's also makes it a lot harder to keep from lighting up. Stick to your plan. Go to a movie or a store where you can't smoke. Lean on your support network, whether it's friends or family who are rooting for you, an app, or a free call with a quitting hotline, like the National Cancer Institute's quitline (877-44 U- QUIT). If you have asthma, your symptoms may get worse around this time. That can be confusing, but it's part of the process and won't last much longer. You'll likely see improvement by day 3. You can talk to your doctor about how to keep your symptoms in check. By the end of day 3, you breathe easier and have more energy. Your lungs start to recover and will keep getting better. During this time, you make huge strides. You can do more because your lungs are stronger and clearer, and your blood flow has improved. You can exercise without getting as winded. And your risk of a heart attack goes down even more. You've also made it through the hardest part of withdrawal. Even so, you'll probably still get cravings. Everyone has different triggers for wanting to smoke. You can't stop all of them, but you can stick to your plan. Ask for help if you need it. Think about the money you're saving. Or try 10 deep breaths, nice and slow. At this point, you can take deeper, clearer breaths. Instead of hacking, you cough in a helpful way that actually clears things out. That helps you get fewer colds and other illnesses. You'll also have more energy. At the end of year 1, treat yourself. You've reached a milestone. And your risk of heart disease is now half of what it was a year ago. Your chances of a stroke and cervical cancer are now the same as a nonsmoker. And compared to when you first quit, you're half as likely to get cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, or bladder. Compared to someone who still smokes, you're now half as likely to die from lung cancer. And the chances you'll get cancer of the larynx (voice box) and pancreas both drop. Finally, after 15 years of not smoking, the chances that you'll get heart disease are the same as if you never smoked. Your body has done a ton of recovery and healing. When you start out, it seems like a long road. But at 15 years, the headaches and discomfort of those first few weeks are a hazy memory. They can seem unbearable at the time, but you can get through it. The rewards are very real and clear."
489,"The black widow is a medium-sized spider -- about a half-inch long. Two species are common to the United States: The southern black widow. This spider has a shiny, black, globe-shaped abdomen. You'll know it by the red hourglass mark on the underside. The northern black widow. You'll notice a row of red spots down the middle of the upper surface of its abdomen. It also has two crosswise bars on the underside. Just to make things interesting, the markings can also be yellow or white. The spider may be brown or have red legs. These spiders are active at night. They prefer dark corners or crevices, like garages. Only the females bite humans, and only when they're disturbed. The black widow spider produces a protein venom (poison) that affects your nervous system. Some people are slightly affected by it, but others may have a severe response. Right away, you may feel severe pain, burning, swelling, and redness at the site. You may even see two fang marks. Other symptoms include: Muscles that begin to hurt and become stiff, usually within 8 hours Nausea or vomiting Difficulty breathing Severe abdominal pain or cramping Excessive sweating Rash and itching Swollen eyelids Weakness or tremors. You may not be able to move your legs. Many of the symptoms of a black widow bite can look like those of other conditions. But if you think you've been bitten by this spider, make an appointment to see your doctor. IMPORTANT: If you suspect your child was bitten by a black widow, get to the emergency room right away. These bites can be fatal in young children. In the meantime, try these tips to ease your symptoms and prevent further infection: Wash the area with soap and water. Apply a cold washcloth or ice pack wrapped in cloth to the area. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like Tylenol. If the bite is on your arm or leg, elevate it to prevent swelling. Apply an antibiotic cream or lotion to the bite. If possible, kill and capture the spider (place it in a plastic bag or jar) and take it to your doctor appointment. This way, he'll know for sure that it was a black widow that bit you. Your doctor will review your symptoms and decide what more treatment, if any, is needed. If they're severe, you may need muscle relaxants or stronger pain medicine. You may have to stay in the hospital, though that's rarely the case. In the most severe cases, your doctor may inject you with antivenin. It's a drug made from substances in the blood of horses. Antivenin neutralizes the black widow's venom. That means it prevents it from causing you harm. Your doctor will only use this treatment after he's spoken with another doctor who has experience in treating these bites. Antivenin can cause a number of side effects, so if your doctor gives it to you, he'll have to monitor you for about 8 to 12 days afterward. Black widow spiders live in cool, dark places like sheds and garages. They normally bite when they're startled or surprised. To reduce your risk of being bitten, keep storage areas clean. And outside, try to avoid woodpiles, fallen tree branches, and other places they may hide."
490,"New medications and treatments for pancreatic cancer must be shown to be safe and effective before doctors can prescribe them to patients. Through pancreatic cancer clinical trials, researchers test the effects of new drugs on a group of volunteers with pancreatic cancer. Following a strict protocol and using carefully controlled conditions, researchers evaluate the investigational drugs under development and measure the ability of the new drug to treat pancreatic cancer, its safety, and any possible side effects. Some patients with pancreatic cancer are reluctant to take part in clinical trials for fear of getting no treatment at all. However, many trials offer patients the most effective therapy available for the condition or treatments that are being evaluated for future use. The drugs being tested may be more or less effective than the current pancreatic cancer treatment. The specifics of a particular clinical trial should be discussed with your doctor. The following web sites offer information and services to help you find a pancreatic cancer clinical trial that is right for you. National Cancer Institute This web site lists more than 6,000 cancer clinical trials and explains what to do when you find one that you think is right for you. Clinical Trials.gov This web site offers up-to-date information for locating federally and privately supported clinical trials for cancer.

491,"Some people with depression prefer non-drug approaches to help them manage their condition and feel better. Natural treatments and home remedies may be good for milder forms of depression. But there's no hard evidence that they're effective for moderate to severe depression. Talk to your doctor about which complementary and alternative treatments might work for you. A health treatment that isn't considered standard Western medical practice is referred to as complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM). These can be anything from diet and exercise to mental conditioning and lifestyle changes, including: Acupuncture Aromatherapy Biofeedback Chiropractic treatments Guided imagery Dietary supplements Hypnosis Massage therapy Meditation Relaxation Yoga St. John's wort is a common herbal supplement suggested for depression. It's been used for medical purposes in other parts of the world for thousands of years. But research findings have been mixed. It seems to work best for mild to moderate depression, not the more severe forms. 5- HTP and SAMe are other supplements that have been studied for depression. Don't take a supplement unless you've talked to your doctor about it. They could interact with your medicines, and they can be dangerous for people with certain conditions. Your doctor can help you weigh the risks and potential benefits. That way, you can make an informed decision. Meditation is sometimes described as an altered state of consciousness. It can help you relax, which helps with your depression. Yoga is part meditation, with specific body poses and breathing techniques. It also helps you relax. Practices vary, and some aren't recommended for people with certain medical conditions. Some evidence suggests yoga may be good for depression, too, but the evidence isn't conclusive. Most touch therapies are based on the idea that the mind and body are interconnected; your physical health and emotional well-being are closely linked. The belief is that when your body is relaxed, your mind can add to better health, less depression, and overall wellness. There are also reports that mind/body exercises, used with various types of bodywork, can boost feelings of calmness. Different forms of exercise can lower stress, relax you, and help lessensymptoms of depression. Exercise can also improve your energy, balance, and flexibility. In general, it's a safe, effective, and easy way to better your health. Check with your doctor before you take on something new or ramp up your activity level. Music can be thought of as a natural tranquilizer for the human spirit. It was used by Pythagoras, the 6th century B. C. philosopher and mathematician. During World War II, veterans' hospitals had volunteers play music for wounded soldiers. The results were so positive that the VA added music therapy programs. Basically, all you need is a CD player or mp3 player with headphones. Then choose music -- from New Age ""mood"" music to rock to classical -- that matches your personal needs, moods, and tastes. Music therapy can be a useful and effective non-drug approach for people of all ages that may help to ease uncomfortable feelings such as fear, anxiety, stress, and grief."
492,"When you're trying to lower cholesterol or triglycerides and prevent heart disease, you may end up in a vitamin shop, facing dozens of supplements. Which ones are worth a try?  The purpose of managing hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia is to reduce cardiovascular disease events and deaths. Fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids have been promoted to help lower triglyceride levels The American Heart Association recommends that you eat non-fried fatty fish (salmon, anchovies, herring, mackerel, tuna, and sardines) at least twice a week. Your body can't make the omega-3s contained in fatty fish like salmon, sardines, tuna, anchovies, and mackerel. Over-the-counter omega-3 supplements are not regulated and studies are inconclusive as to their benefit. Prescription omega-3 ( Epanova, Lovaza , Omtryg or Vascepa) could be prescribed for adults with triglycerides 500 mg/dl or higher. These prescriptions are regulated by the FDA for quality and safety. Psyllium. Fiber is a great cholesterol-buster and part of a healthy diet. Fiber also helps lower triglycerides and total cholesterol, especially for people with type 2 diabetes. There is no substitute for getting enough fiber from foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; however if your cholesterol is high despite a healthy diet, psyllium can help. It'll whisk away cholesterol, but like other fiber, it can make you need to go to bathroom more often or cause constipation if you don't also increase your water intake. Soy protein supplements. Soy can lower total and LDL cholesterol levels a little. Eating soy protein instead of animal protein (like meat and full-fat dairy) will also help. Coenzyme Q10. This powerful antioxidant can lower bad LDL cholesterol's ability to stick to the blood vessels of mice. However, scientists say that more research is needed to confirm whether it can work in humans. So, what about it does work? If you're taking a statin to lower your cholesterol and having muscle pain as a side effect, there is some proof that coenzyme Q10 can help ease it. Garlic. Garlic supplements slightly lowered total and LDL cholesterol levels in a few small studies. But overall, the evidence doesn't seem to support garlic as an effective way to lower cholesterol. Niacin. This B vitamin can boost HDL âgood"" cholesterol and lower LDL âbadâ cholesterol and triglycerides -- but only use it if your doctor advises you to. Only prescription-level doses impact cholesterol and triglycerides. Prescription-strength doses have side effects, which is one reason it should be taken under doctor supervision. Red yeast rice. This supplement has the same active ingredient found in cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. However, the FDA has classified it as a drug and has banned its sale as a supplement in the U. S., saying it needs more regulation because of side effects. If you find it in a store for sale without a prescription, it may not be the real thing. If you're ordering online, beware! It can have the same side effects as medications and have negative interactions with other drugs. Policosanol. There was a lot of hype that this mix of sugar cane and beeswax is a cholesterol-buster. But the positive studies were tied closely to a company that makes the product. Independent studies found no benefit. Check with your doctor before you take any supplement or non-prescription treatment. Keep a medicine diary so that you can show your doctor and pharmacist what you're taking. Or just bring all the meds and supplements you take with you to your next appointment. Supplements are just one part of your total care plan. They're called âsupplementsâ for a reason. If you take them, it should only be as part of a larger effort to lower cholesterol and triglycerides. A healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and meds, if prescribed by your doctor, should be the other parts of your plan."
493,"If you have atrial fibrillation, a common type of arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat, and are pregnant or planning to try, you might wonder how it affects pregnancy. The good news is that every year, thousands of women with atrial fibrillation deliver healthy babies. You'll want to work closely with your doctor to make sure your heart medications are OK for pregnancy and know what signs to watch out for, just in case. It's safe to get pregnant when you have AFib, but you might have extra doctor visits once you're expecting, to help prevent complications. Ideally, you should discuss with your doctor the possible effects AFib can have on a pregnancy before you become pregnant. The most common medications that people take that cause the fetus to be at risk are blood thinners, medications to slow the heart down, or medications that try to maintain a normal rhythm. You should talk to your doctor about what AFib prescriptions you might need to stop before you get pregnant. Some of these medications can harm your baby's development in the first trimester, when organs are first developing. If you stop taking them before you're pregnant, it can curb that risk. But you'll need to work with your doctor to do that. During pregnancy, your body makes more blood than usual, changes the flow of blood to direct more to your uterus (womb), and makes extra hormones that can change how organs, including your heart, and blood vessels work. In turn, your heart actually grows and your heart rate speeds up. Many healthy women notice heart palpitations, flutters in their chest, or skipped heartbeats while pregnant. If you already had AFib, all these changes can make you more likely to have heart rhythm problems come back or get worse. And for some women, who never had AFib before, pregnancy can be when it first starts. Doctors often diagnose new cases of AFib during the third trimester of pregnancy. During pregnancy, AFib that's not under control can make heart problems more likely. You may also be more likely to deliver a low birth weight baby, give birth too early, and to have pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia. Because of these risks, you'll probably have extra appointments with your doctor to make sure your pregnancy goes well and to check on how your heart is doing. With atrial fibrillation, many times you will have regular visits with not only your obstetrician, but also with a cardiologist. Your doctors may recommend that you see a âhigh-riskâ obstetrician, who is prepared for potential problems with the pregnancy. Which AFib medications are right for you during pregnancy depends on your particular case and how severe your AFib is. Many medications carry risks during pregnancy, including a higher rate of birth defects, miscarriages, or premature labor. But bouts of atrial fibrillation can also be dangerous, potentially slowing the flow of blood going to your baby. You and your doctor will weigh the risks and benefits of different treatments for your individual case. You may switch medications or stop taking those for AFib completely during your pregnancy. In general, AFib medications that are avoided during pregnancy include: Blood-thinning medications including warfarin ( Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran ( Pradaxa), rivaroxaban ( Xarelto) and apixaban ( Eliquis) Antiarrhythmia drugs including amiodarone, which has been linked to babies being born with hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) Verapamil and diltiazem may raise the odds of birth defects and heart problems. Some AFib medications have better safety records during pregnancy. So your doctor may recommend that you switch to a different drug. For instance, you could get aspirin (during the second and third trimesters) or heparin to thin your blood and reduce the risk of blood clots. Doctors often prefer the beta-blockers metoprolol and atenolol over other beta-blockers, which are drugs that lower blood pressure and slow your heart rate, to help control the atrial fibrillation. Digoxin, a common heart disease medication, is considered safe during pregnancy and is one of the preferred medications for pregnant women with AFib. Quinidine, which you take by IV, also seems to be safe to take during pregnancy. If you have AFib and are pregnant, you should watch for signs of blood clots, including: Swelling, redness, and pain in an arm or leg A fast heartbeat Lightheadedness Trouble or pain with breathing Chest pain or tightness Pain that extends to your shoulder, arm, back, or jaw Sudden weakness or numbness of your face, arm, or leg Sudden trouble speaking or understanding speech Sudden changes in your vision You should also call your doctor if you have signs of a new or worsening arrhythmia. These include: Heart palpitations, rapid heartbeats, or fluttering or pounding in your chest Fatigue Dizziness or lightheadedness Fainting or near-fainting spells Shortness of breath Chest pain When you near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor might change your medications again so that you're not taking any blood thinners immediately before or during labor and delivery. During labor, your doctor will track how your heart is doing, to make sure the stress of giving birth doesn't cause a heart rhythm problem, or arrhythmia. After you deliver your baby, you will be able to take blood-thinning medicines again. Your doctor may need to adjust your medication plan if you plan to breastfeed your little one."
494,"A stent is a tiny tube that can play a big role in treating your heart disease. It helps keep your arteries -- the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to other parts of your body, including the heart muscle itself -- open. Most stents are made out of wire mesh and are permanent. Some are made out of fabric. These are called stent grafts and are often used for larger arteries. Others are made of a material that dissolves and that your body absorbs over time. They're coated in medicine that slowly releases into your artery to prevent it from being blocked again. If a fatty substance called plaque builds up inside an artery, it can reduce blood flow to your heart. This is called coronary heart disease and it can cause chest pain. The plaque can also cause a blood clot that blocks blood flowing to your heart, which may lead to a heart attack. By keeping an artery open, stents lower your risk of chest pain. They can also treat a heart attack that's in progress. To put a stent in, your doctor makes a small cut in a blood vessel in your groin, arm, or neck. He then threads a thin tube called a catheter through the blood vessel to the blocked artery. The tube has a tiny balloon at the end of it. Your doctor inflates the balloon inside your blocked artery. This widens your artery so blood can flow through it again. He then places the stent inside your artery. He'll remove the catheter and balloon, but the stent stays inside to keep the artery open. The procedure takes about an hour, but you'll probably stay in the hospital overnight. Risks may include: Bleeding at the spot on your skin where your doctor inserted the tube Damage to your blood vessel from the tube Infection Irregular heartbeat About 1% to 2% of people who have a stent may get a blood clot where the stent is placed. This can put you at risk for a heart attack or stroke. Your risk of getting a blood clot is highest during the first few months after the procedure. After you get a stent put in, your doctor might tell to you to take aspirin or another medication to prevent blood clots. You may need to take the medicine for 1 month up to 1 year or for the rest of your life. These simple steps can help you have a smooth recovery: Ask your doctor what medicines you should or shouldn't take before the procedure. Follow the instructions for taking your medicines and don't stop them before your doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you notice any signs of infection such as pain, swelling, or redness at the spot where he put in the tube. Avoid intense exercise or lifting heavy objects afterward. Your doctor will tell you when it's OK to start exercising. Go to all of your follow-up appointments. You'll enjoy more blood flow to your heart and less chest pain. But a stent can't cure coronary heart disease. You can help prevent plaque buildup inside your arteries with a few changes to your lifestyle: Exercise more Drop some pounds if you're overweight Quit smoking if you've got the tobacco habit Reduce stress Take all medications your doctor prescribes You may be able to return to work in a week. If you're not sure whether certain activities are safe to do with a stent, ask your doctor."
495,"Eczema is a common problem that causes the skin to become inflamed. People often also call it dermatitis.  Eczema comes in many forms. But the different types of eczema tend to cause these symptoms: Itching . The itching can be intense. The damage to the skin during eczema is often due to scratching. Scaling. The surface of the skin can flake off, giving the skin a rough, scaly appearance. Redness. The affected skin may bleed and appear blotchy. Fluid-filled blisters. These can ooze and form crusts. Cracking. Severely affected skin may develop painful, deep cracks, also called fissures. Depending on the cause, eczema may flare up and cause severe symptoms. But it can also become a chronic problem with less intense symptoms. Here's a look at the types of eczema and their treatments. Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema. It often affects people who also have: Asthma or hay fever Family history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever Defects in the skin barrier, allowing moisture out and germs in Atopic dermatitis usually begins during infancy or childhood. But it can strike people at any age. Most often, it affects skin on the: Face Hands Feet Inner elbows Back of the knees Over time, scratching the skin can cause it to become thick and red. Scratching can also create wounds that become infected. Irritants that can make symptoms of atopic dermatitis worse include: Soap Rough clothing Household chemicals Foods, dust mites, and other allergy triggers can also make symptoms worse. Treatments for atopic dermatitis include: Products to lubricate and moisturize the skin Steroid creams and ointments Drugs that control the immune system including dupilumab ( Dupixent), which is given as an injection every two weeks, and crisaborole ( Eucrisa), a non-steroidal ointment that is used topically twice a day. Antibiotics to treat infections Ultraviolet light, alone or with a drug called psoralen There are two types of contact dermatitis: Irritant contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis These types of eczema can develop after a substance damages the skin. These include chemicals and frequent hand washing. Irritant contact dermatitis can develop after touching a strong irritant one time or by coming into contact with the irritating substance repeatedly. Contact dermatitis can also develop after a person touches an allergy-triggering substance, such as: Nickel Cosmetics Poison ivy The hands are especially vulnerable to developing contact dermatitis. People can develop contact dermatitis even if they don't have atopic dermatitis. Treatments for irritant contact dermatitis include: Moisturizers for the skin Steroid medications Treatments for contact dermatitis from allergic triggers also include steroid drugs. These are rubbed on the skin or taken as a pill. For either type of contact dermatitis, antibiotics may be necessary. Avoiding future contact with the irritant or allergy trigger is also important. Wearing gloves can help protect the skin on the hands, which are often affected. This type of eczema affects the hands and feet. The cause is unknown. The first symptom may be severe itching. Blisters may then appear, which give way a few weeks later to scaly patches. Sometimes deep cracks can appear on the hands or fingers. This type of eczema may become chronic and painful. Treatments include: Cool, wet compresses Steroid drugs that are rubbed onto the skin or taken by mouth Psoralen combined with ultraviolet A therapy This type of eczema more often affects men than women. Men usually don't get their first outbreak before their mid-50s. Women tend to get it in their teen years or early adulthood. Nummular dermatitis causes coin-shaped red marks. The marks appear most often on the: Legs Backs of the hands Forearms Lower back Hips The cause of nummular dermatitis is unknown. However, factors that may raise the chance that an outbreak will strike include: Cold, dry air Exposure to chemicals such as formaldehyde Exposure to metals, including nickel Treatments for nummular dermatitis include: Protecting your skin from scratches and other injuries Taking a lukewarm bath or shower, then applying a moisturizer to your skin Applying a steroid ointment to the rash Taking a steroid medication by mouth or injection that goes to work throughout your body Taking antibiotics if an infection develops People with this type of eczema develop skin irritation in spots that they frequently scratch out of habit. This type of eczema often affects these areas: Back Sides or back of the neck Genitals Scalp Wrists Ankles Inside and behind the ear People may scratch affected areas during the day without realizing it. They may also scratch while asleep. Usually, neurodermatitis causes a skin outbreak that doesn't get any bigger. But the irritated skin can grow thick and deeply wrinkled. Infections may also develop in the irritated areas. The main treatment for this type of eczema is to stop scratching it. In the meantime, steroid medicines that are rubbed onto the skin can help treat symptoms. When neurodermatitis affects the scalp, it can be harder to treat. In these cases, it may require the steroid medication prednisone, which is taken by mouth. This type of eczema is better known as dandruff. In infants, it affects the scalp. In adults, it also often affects these areas: Eyebrows Sides of the nose Area behind the ears Groin Center of chest Seborrheic dermatitis causes skin to fall off in flakes. The condition may be due to an overgrowth of a type of yeast that normally lives in these areas, as well as an overgrowth and rapid shedding of cells on the scalp. It may be especially hard to treat in people whose immune systems aren't working properly, including people with AIDS . Treatments vary between infants and people with the condition later in life. The treatments include: Shampoo containing salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione, or coal tar Antifungal treatments that are rubbed onto affected areas Steroid lotions This type of eczema can develop in people when the veins in their lower legs don't properly return blood to their heart. Stasis dermatitis can arise quickly, causing weeping and crusting of the skin. Over time, this type of eczema can cause the skin to develop brown stains. Treatments include: Steroid creams or ointments Creams or lotions that lubricate the skin Moist compresses Antibiotics to treat infections Elevating the legs Compression stockings"
496," Many different treatments can help if your cancer has spread to bone, commonly called bone metastasis or bone ""mets."" Treatment can't cure bone metastasis, but it can relieve pain, help prevent complications, and improve your quality of life. Doctors use two types of treatments for metastatic cancer in the bones. Systemic treatments can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Local treatments directly target the cancer in the bone. The treatment you get will depend upon: Where your cancer started, and the kind of primary tumor you have Which bones the cancer has invaded The extent of damage to the bones Which types of treatment you already have had Your overall health Let your doctor know if your treatment isn't easing your pain and other symptoms. You may find that other approaches work better for you. Chemotherapy is a common systemic treatment for bone metastasis. Your doctor will use a type of chemo that is effective against your primary tumor. So, if you have metastatic lung cancer, for example, your doctor will use drugs that are effective against lung cancer. How it works. Anti-cancer drugs target and curb cancer growth. In most cases, you take chemo by mouth or through a vein (by IV). This can often shrink the tumors, which will ease your pain and help you feel better. Possible side effects. Chemo can kill normal cells in addition to cancer cells. The side effects you might have will depend on: The type and amount of drugs you take The length of your treatment Common side effects of chemotherapy include: Loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting Hair loss Mouth sores Infection Bleeding or bruising Weakness or fatigue Your doctor can help you prevent or manage these. Most side effects go away once you stop treatment. This group of drugs works best in cases where metastasis is weakening the bone. How it works. You receive bisphosphonates by mouth or IV infusion every 3 to 4 weeks. These drugs help with bone metastasis by: Slowing bone damage and reducing the risk of bone fractures Easing bone pain Reducing high levels of calcium in the blood Possible side effects. The most common ones include: Fatigue Fever Nausea or vomiting Anemia Bone or joint pain A rare and serious side effect is bone death (osteonecrosis) of the jaw. Ask your doctor about precautions to take before beginning this treatment. Osteonecrosis may cause: Jaw bone pain, swelling, or numbness Loss of gum tissue Loose teeth Infection Another available treatment is denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). It's given by injection and may work as well as or better than bisphosphonates to prevent fractures. But it also can cause osteonecrosis, as well as low calcium levels in the blood. These drugs contain radioactive elements that target cancer cells. Doctors tend to use this systemic treatment when the metastasis is stimulating new bone growth. This is more common with prostate cancer. If your cancer has spread to many bones, these drugs may be a better option than standard radiation, which uses a beam to aim radiation at each bone metastasis. However, sometimes doctors combine radiopharmaceuticals and standard radiation. How it works. The doctor injects a single dose of the drug into a vein. It then travels to the areas of bone with cancer and gives off radiation to kill the cancer. This single dose may be effective against pain for several months. You can receive another treatment later. Possible side effects. The most common ones include: Infections Bleeding Temporary increase in pain (flare reaction) This systemic treatment helps your immune system spot and more effectively kill cancer cells. Some methods of immunotherapy have been used for a while, and some are still experimental. How it works. Immunotherapy works in one of two main ways: It boosts your body's immune system to fight the cancer. It uses a man-made version of proteins to kill cancer cells. Examples of immunotherapy for cancer include: Cytokines -- substances secreted by the immune system that have an effect on other cells Monoclonal antibodies -- a class of antibodies made in the lab from a single population of cells Tumor vaccines -- vaccines using a substance that prompts the immune system to respond to a tumor Possible side effects. Side effects vary, depending upon the type of immunotherapy. They may include: Fever and chills Weakness Headache Nausea or diarrhea Rashes Radiation is a ""local treatment"" because it does not affect your entire body. It uses high-energy X-rays or particles to destroy or slow the growth of cancer cells in the bone. It helps most if you have only one or two bone metastases. You may receive it alone or combined with other types of treatment. How it works. A machine focuses a beam of radiation on the bone metastasis. This treatment, called external beam radiation, lasts only a few minutes. You may receive radiation in one large dose or in smaller amounts over several treatments. Possible side effects. Early, temporary side effects depend on the location being treated, but may include: Fatigue Skin changes Surgery can often help relieve bone metastasis symptoms. How it works. If a bone is broken, surgery may help relieve pain quickly. Surgery can also help stabilize a weak bone to keep it from breaking. The surgeon may insert: Screws Rods Pins Plates Cages Possible side effects. These include the usual risks of any surgery, such as infection. If surgery is not an option, your doctor may use a cast or splint, or inject bone cement to help you move better and relieve pain. With this local treatment, a needle or probe is put into the tumor to destroy it. Though used more often for other types of metastasis, ablation can help if you have a problem with one or two bone tumors. How it works. Some methods of ablation use chemicals or alcohol to kill the tumor. Two common methods include: Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA). A needle delivers an electric current to heat the tumor. Cryoablation. A probe is used to freeze the tumor. Afterward, the doctor may fill the space created by ablation with bone cement to help stabilize the bone. Possible side effects. This procedure is generally safe but may cause some temporary soreness, swelling, and bruising. This noninvasive procedure uses ultrasound energy and imaging technology to provide pain relief by destroying nerve endings in the area of the tumor. Because there is no incision, and no probe is inserted, the procedure is typically done on an outpatient basis with a local anesthetic rather than general anesthesia. While complications are possible, they are rare. How it works. A specialist uses imaging to target the specific area to be treated with ultrasound. Then, heat that's made when ultrasound penetrates the targeted tissue destroys nerve endings in the bone around the tumor. The destruction of nerve endings results in pain relief. Possible side effects. Possible complications include skin burns and damage to heat-sensitive organs that are next to the treated area."
497,"Cavities are what you get from tooth decay -- damage to the tooth. Tooth decay can affect both the outer coating of a tooth (called enamel) and the inner layer (called dentin).  What causes decay? When foods with carbohydrates like bread, cereal, milk, soda, fruit, cake, or candy stay on your teeth. The bacteria in your mouth turn them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and your saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel, creating holes called cavities. Many people think only children get cavities, but changes in your mouth as you age make them an adult problem, too. As you get older, your gums pull away from your teeth. They can also pull away because of gum disease. This exposes the roots of your teeth to plaque. And if you eat a lot of sugary or high-carb foods, you're more likely to get cavities. Older adults sometimes get decay around the edges of fillings. Seniors often have a lot of dental work because they didn't get fluoride or good oral care when they were kids. Over the years, these fillings can weaken teeth and break. Bacteria gather in the gaps and cause decay. Your dentist finds cavities during a regular dental checkup. He'll probe your teeth, looking for soft spots, or use X-rays to check between your teeth. If you've had a cavity for a while, you might get a toothache, especially after you eat or drink something sweet, hot, or cold. Sometimes you can see pits or holes in your teeth. Treatment depends on how bad the cavity is. Most often, the dentist removes the decayed portion of your tooth with a drill. He fills in the hole with a filling made of either silver alloy, gold, porcelain, or a composite resin. These materials are safe. Some people have raised concerns about mercury-based fillings called amalgams, but the American Dental Association, the FDA, and other public health agencies say they are safe. Allergies to fillings are rare. Crowns are used when a tooth is so badly decayed that not much of it remains. Your dentist removes and repairs the damaged part. He fits a crown made from gold, porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal over the rest of the tooth. You might need a root canal if the root or pulp of your tooth is dead or injured in a way that can't be repaired. The dentist removes the nerve, blood vessels, and tissue along with the decayed portions of the tooth. He fills in the roots with a sealing material. You may need a crown over the filled tooth."
498,"Anger is a very powerful feeling that can happen when you are frustrated, hurt, annoyed, or disappointed. Anger can help or hurt you, depending on how you react to it. If you can react without hurting someone else, it can be a positive feeling. If you hold your anger inside, it can lead to passive-aggressive behavior like ''getting back'' at people without telling them why or being critical and hostile. Knowing how to recognize and express these feelings in appropriate ways can help you handle emergencies, solve problems, and hold on to meaningful relationships. When you're angry, you might feel anywhere between a slight irritation to rage. When you start feeling angry, try deep breathing, positive self-talk, or stopping your angry thoughts. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm. Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as ""relax"" or ""take it easy."" Repeat it to yourself while breathing deeply until the anger subsides. Although expressing anger is better than keeping it in, there's a right way to do it. Try to express yourself clearly and calmly. Angry outbursts are stressful to your nervous and cardiovascular systems and can make health problems worse. Consider the value of physical activity like regular exercise as a way to both improve your mood and release tension and anger. Avoid using recreational drugs and drinking too much alcohol, which can make you less able to handle frustration. Alcohol can also loosen your inhibitions so that you say or do something your normally wouldn't. Get support from others. Talk through your feelings and try to work on changing your behaviors. If you have trouble realizing when you are having angry thoughts, keep a written log of when you feel angry. Try to gain a different perspective by putting yourself in another's place. Learn how to laugh at yourself and see humor in situations. Practice good listening skills. Listening can help improve communication and can build trusting feelings between people. This trust can help you deal with potentially hostile emotions. A useful communication exercise is to say to someone, â Let me make sure I understand what you're sayingâ and then restate back to them what you perceive as their main message or point of view. Often, this approach helps to clarify misunderstandings that can lead to frustrations, and help identify issues on which you may ultimately âagree to disagreeâ without turning into a fight. Learn to assert yourself, expressing your feelings calmly and directly without becoming defensive, hostile, or emotionally charged. Read self-help books or seek help from a professional therapist to learn how to use assertiveness and anger management skills. If you don't deal with your anger, it can lead to anxiety and depression. It can disrupt your relationships and raise your risk of illness. Long-term anger has been linked to health problems like high blood pressure, heart problems, headaches, skin disorders, and digestive problems. Unchecked anger can be linked to crime, abuse, and other violent behavior. Sometimes, a pattern of inappropriate anger can also be a symptom of a mood disorder, a personality disorder, a substance use problem, or another mental health problem. If you believe that your anger is out of control and is having a negative effect on your life and relationships, seek the help of a mental health professional. A psychologist or other licensed mental health professional can work with you to learn techniques for changing your thinking and your behavior. A mental health professional can help you deal with your anger in an appropriate way. Ask your doctor if medicines could be helpful. Sometimes, antidepressants, certain anticonvulsants, and low-dose antipsychotics can help manage sudden attacks of rage or anger. Avoid alcohol, short-acting benzodiazepines like Xanax, or street drugs that can make you say or do things more impulsively. Choose your therapist carefully, and make sure to talk to a professional who is trained to teach anger management and assertiveness skills."
499,"No matter how careful you are, your little one will probably get diaper rash at some point. Most babies do. So, plan ahead. Learn how to treat diaper rash and prevent flare-ups. Your baby's little bottom will thank you! Leaving a wet or dirty diaper on too long Rubbing or chafing against the diaper itself Yeast infection Bacterial infection Allergic reaction to diaper A harmless rash that's often seen on a baby's scalp, called cradle cap, can also show up on his bottom. Doctors call it seborrheic dermatitis. It causes red, scaly, waxy patches that eventually go away without treatment. You might notice it on other parts of your baby's body, too. Babies get a diaper rash more often when they: Get older -- especially between 9 and 12 months old Sleep in poopy diapers Have diarrhea Start eating solid foods Are taking antibiotics, or if you take antibiotics and are nursing Wash your hands before and after every diaper change. Check your baby's diaper often, and change it as soon as it becomes wet or soiled. Use plain water. When you need to get poop off your baby's skin, use a mild cleanser. Gently pat the area clean and dry, rather than rubbing. If you use wipes, choose mild ones. Try to avoid those with fragrances or alcohol. Or use a clean, soft washcloth. Be sure the area is completely clean and dry before putting on a fresh diaper. Bad rashes call for extra measures! Try a squirt bottle to wash the area well, without rubbing sore skin. Let your baby go diaper-free as much as possible. Airing out the diaper zone helps a baby's skin heal faster. To avoid a mess, do it right after a bowel movement. These products aim to soothe a baby's sore skin or create a protective barrier -- or both. Smooth on cream or ointment to your baby's clean, dry bottom before putting on a clean diaper. Look for zinc oxide or petrolatum (petroleum jelly) on the ingredients list. If you use baby powder, keep it away from your baby's face. The talc or cornstarch in the powder can cause breathing problems. Place it in your hand, then apply it to the diaper area. Skip the steroid creams you find in the drug store (hydrocortisone) unless your doctor tells you to use one. They can irritate your baby's bottom even more if used incorrectly. Some parents find these changes lead to fewer diaper rashes: Change the type of diaper. If you use cloth, try disposables. Or try a different brand of disposable diaper. If you wash your own cloth diapers, change your detergent. Choose a mild, hypoallergenic detergent. Or add a half-cup of vinegar to the rinse cycle. The rash gets worse or doesn't respond to treatment in 2 or 3 days. Your baby has a fever or seems sluggish. You see yellow, fluid-filled bumps (pustules) and honey-colored crusty areas. This might be a bacterial infection that requires antibiotics. You notice symptoms of a yeast infection: A swollen red rash with white scales and lesions Small red pimples outside of the diaper area Redness in the folds of the baby's skin Your pediatrician can prescribe an antifungal medicine to clear it up."
500,"You may feel like your eyes have a mind of their own. They move up and down, side to side, or in a circle. This is called nystagmus or ""dancing eyes."" It's a condition where you can't control your eye movements. It may be a sign of another eye problem or medical condition. You may be born with it, or you might develop it later in life. Nystagmus is caused by many different things, including: Being passed down from your parents Other eye issues, like cataracts or strabismus Diseases like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or Meniere's disease Head injuries Albinism (lack of skin pigment) Inner ear problems Certain medications, like lithium or drugs for seizures Alcohol or drug use Sometimes, your doctor may not know what causes it. Your eyes move without your control. It might be fast, then slow, then fast again. The movement might be in one eye, but it's usually in both eyes. You may notice that you nod your head or keep it in strange positions. You do that because it helps you focus when you can't hold your gaze steady. Things look clearer when you tilt or turn your head. Objects may seem a little blurry to children with nystagmus. But the world doesn't look shaky to them. It's different if you develop the condition as an adult. Then the world appears to move a little when you look around. Nystagmus may also affect your vision. You might have a hard time seeing in the dark, or you may be sensitive to bright light. You may have problems with balance and dizziness. These can be worse if you're tired or stressed. If you think you or your child may have symptoms of nystagmus, see your eye doctor. She'll look at the insides of your eyes and test your vision. She'll also look for other eye problems. You might get other tests, including: Ear exam Neurological exam Brain MRI Brain CT scan Recording your eye movement Your doctor may ask you to spin around in the chair for about 30 seconds, stop, and then try to stare at an object. If you have nystagmus, your eyes will first move slowly in one direction. Then they'll move quickly the other way. If you developed nystagmus as an adult, there may be simple things you can do to lessen its effects. Sometimes you may just have to stop a medicine or quit drinking alcohol or taking drugs. Wear the right contacts or glasses to improve vision. It won't cure nystagmus, but it can help with other eye problems that can make it worse. Eye muscle surgery may be an option. The goal is to help with the head tilt that often comes with nystagmus. Sometimes surgery improves vision, too. Some drugs may ease symptoms in adults but not children. These include the anti-seizure medicine gabapentin ( Neurontin), the muscle relaxant baclofen ( Lioresal), and Botox. For people who are very nearsighted, LASIK or Visian ICL can help improve eyesight. There are things you can do at home to make it easier to deal with your ""dancing eyes."" Use large-print books and turn up the print size on your computer, tablet, and phone. More lighting may help with vision, too. If your child has nystagmus, encourage her to use her eyes. Big and brightly colored toys are easiest to use. Choose toys that make noise and have unique textures. Let your child hold books close to her eyes with her head tilted. Let her wear a hat or tinted glasses -- even indoors -- to reduce glare. Talk to your child's teacher to make things easier at school. It would be hard for her to share books or papers. Let her choose where to sit so she can see the board and the teacher."
501,"Diverticular disease consists of three conditions that involve the development of small sacs or pockets in the wall of the colon, including diverticulosis, diverticular bleeding, and diverticulitis. Diverticulosis is the formation of numerous tiny pockets, or diverticula, in the lining of the bowel. Diverticula, which can range from pea-size to much larger, are formed by increased pressure on weakened spots of the intestinal walls by gas, waste, or liquid. Diverticula can form while straining during a bowel movement, such as with constipation. They are most common in the lower portion of the large intestine (called the sigmoid colon). Diverticulosis is very common and occurs in 10% of people over age 40 and in 50% of people over age 60. Most people will have no or few symptoms from diverticula. Complications can occur in about 20% of people with diverticulosis. One of these complications is rectal bleeding, called diverticular bleeding, and another is diverticular infection, called diverticulitis. Diverticular Bleeding Diverticular bleeding occurs with chronic injury to the small blood vessels that are next to the diverticula. Diverticulitis Diverticulitis occurs when there is inflammation and infection in one or more diverticula. This usually happens when outpouchings become blocked with waste, allowing bacteria to build up, causing infection. Diverticulosis does not cause any troublesome symptoms. Diverticulitis, infection and inflammation of diverticula, can occur suddenly and without warning. Symptoms of diverticulitis may include: Diarrhea and/or constipation Painful cramps or tenderness in the lower abdomen Chills or fever Because people with diverticulosis do not have any symptoms, it is usually found through tests ordered for an unrelated reason. They usually include barium enema, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. If you are experiencing the symptoms of diverticulitis, it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor will ask questions about your medical history (such as bowel habits, symptoms, diet, and current medications) and perform a physical exam, possibly including a digital rectal exam. One or more diagnostic tests may be ordered. Tests usually include blood tests and CT scanning. In people with rapid, heavy rectal bleeding, the doctor may perform a procedure called angiography to locate the source of the bleeding. People who have diverticulosis without symptoms or complications do not need specific treatment, yet it is important to adopt a high-fiber diet to prevent the further formation of diverticula. Laxatives should not be used to treat diverticulosis and enemas should also be avoided or used infrequently. Serious complications can occur as a result of diverticulitis. Most of them are the result of the development of a tear or perforation of the intestinal wall. If this occurs, intestinal waste material can leak out of the intestines and into the surrounding abdominal cavity causing the following problems: Peritonitis (a painful infection of the abdominal cavity) Abscesses (""walled off"" infections in the abdomen) Obstruction (blockages of the intestine) If an abscess is present, the doctor will need to drain the fluid by inserting a needle into the infected area. Sometimes surgery is needed to clean the abscess and remove part of the colon. If the infection spreads into the abdominal cavity (peritonitis), surgery is needed to clean the cavity and remove the damaged part of the colon. Without proper treatment, peritonitis can be fatal. Infection can lead to scarring of the colon, and the scar tissue may cause a partial or complete blockage. A partial blockage does not require emergency surgery. However, surgery is required with complete blockage. Another complication of diverticulitis is the formation of a fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs, or between an organ and the skin. A common type of fistula is between the bladder and colon. This requires surgery to remove the fistula and affected part of the colon. To prevent diverticular disease or reduce the complications from it, maintain good bowel habits. Have regular bowel movements and avoid constipation and straining. Eating appropriate amounts of the right types of fiber and drinking plenty of water and exercising regularly will help keep bowels regulated. The American Dietetic Association recommends 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day. Every person, regardless of the presence of diverticula, should try to consume this much fiber every day. Fiber is the indigestible part of plant foods. High-fiber foods include whole grain breads, cereals, and crackers; berries; fruit; vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, spinach, carrots, asparagus, squash, and beans; brown rice; bran products; and cooked dried peas and beans, among other foods."
502," Even mild chronic pain -- whether from arthritis, migraines, or another condition -- can really get to you. Naturally, you want to make the hurt go away. But what type of pain reliever do you need? Many are â NSAIDs,â or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They lower the level of chemicals called prostaglandins that are involved in inflammation. The result: less swelling and pain. Some NSAIDs need a prescription. Others are sold âover the counter,â or â OTC,â which means you don't need a prescription to buy them. Examples include ibuprofen and naproxen. It depends upon what the problem is, and on what's OK for you. Your doctor can help you decide. Or if you're in the drugstore and wondering what to try, ask the pharmacist. Remember, even if you don't need a prescription, medicines can still have side effects. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions. Don't take too much, or for too long. If you need pain medicine for more than 10 days, talk to your doctor to see which one is right for you. Tell your doctor about everything you take, even if you bought it over the counter. He can check to make sure it's OK for you. Before recommending a specific pain pill, your doctor will consider: Your medical history Your current health concerns Other medicines you take Allergies and past reactions to meds How well your liver and kidneys work Any surgeries you've had Your overall treatment plan and goals For most people, side effects from NSAIDs, if any, are minor. The most common ones include: Dizziness or headache Nausea Excess gas Diarrhea or constipation Extreme tiredness or weakness Dry mouth Serious ones are rare. They can include: Bleeding problems Damage to the stomach and small intestine lining that can lead to ulcers Kidney disease Elevated blood pressure Muscle cramps Hearing problems Side effects vary among NSAIDs. Your doctor or your pharmacist can give you specific information about the side effects of the particular drug you're taking. Tell your doctor if: You're allergic to aspirin or any other pain reliever. You have more than three alcoholic drinks a day. You have stomach ulcers or bleeding in your digestive system. You've got liver or kidney disease. You have heart disease. You take blood-thinning medicine or have a bleeding disorder. Although aspirin taken in low doses with a doctor's supervision can help protect some people from a heart attack, some NSAIDs can raise your risk of heart disease and strokes, especially when you take high doses or take them for a long time. They can also interfere with blood pressure medicine, making it less effective. Children and teenagers under 18 years old shouldn't take aspirin unless directed by their doctor, due to the risk of a serious condition called Reye's syndrome."
503,"Many people take vitamins and supplements to help ease joint pain and arthritis. How effective are these supplements? Here are tips to help you choose the right supplements for your joints. Arthritis Joint Pain: Supplements and Herbs Some people use supplements to try to help manage joint pain from arthritis. Glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3, and green tea are just a few of them. Glucosamine Glucosamine helps keep the cartilage in joints healthy and may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Natural glucosamine levels drop as people age. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil and other foods, encourage the body to produce chemicals that help control inflammation. This supplement may help ease stiffness caused by inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis, but more research is needed. Green tea Green tea contains compounds that have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may be helpful in combating join pain. Vitamin D Vitamin D is very important for people with joint pain. Research shows that people with low levels of vitamin D may have more joint pain.

504,"When you're a new mom or dad, it can be a huge challenge to parent a baby who's always cranky. Friends may say your baby is ""colicky."" What's going on and how can you make it through this?  Colic is a bit of a mystery. The term applies to any healthy, well-fed infant who cries more than 3 hours a day, more than 3 days a week, for more than 3 weeks. Here's what we know about it: Colic is likely to start around age 2 weeks if your infant is full-term (or later if premature). It almost always goes away on its own by 3 or 4 months. Your baby's sex and birth order, and whether you breast- or bottle-feed, don't affect it. Kids who had colic as babies are no different from those who didn't. Colic's exact cause is unknown, and that's why there's not a clear way to help it. Some theories of what's behind it include: A growing digestive system with muscles that often spasm Gas Hormones that cause stomach pain or a fussy mood Oversensitivity or overstimulation by light, noise, etc. A moody baby A still-developing nervous system Remember, there are many things that can seem like colic but aren't. If you're concerned about your baby, your doctor can do a full exam to rule out a medical cause for why your baby cries and is fussy. She could be irritable because of: An infection Acid reflux or stomach problems Pressure or inflammation of the brain and nervous system Eye trouble, like a scratch or increased pressure Irregular heartbeat Injury to bones, muscles, or fingers Based on your baby's needs for colic, your doctor can help. You'll likely have to try one thing at a time to see if it calms her. If it doesn't in a few days, move on to another one. You may find one you think works. Know that colic can get better on its own and you may just have to wait for the fussiness to improve on its own at 4 months or so. Beware of ""cures"" that claim to work for all babies. There is no such thing. Here are some things to try to ease colic. It's a challenge when you have a baby with colic. Know that it's normal and common to sometimes feel angry or resentful toward your cranky little one. You are not a bad parent to feel that way, so don't feel guilty. Everyone has these feelings sometime. If you're at the end of the rope, remember it is OK to leave baby in his crib or play pen for a short time while you leave the room to collect yourself."
505,"There are some simple exams that can help your doctor figure out if you or your child has heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( He FH), a condition that sends your cholesterol numbers way up. He FH runs in families. It causes too much LDL ""bad"" cholesterol to build up in your blood, which can lead to heart disease. It's important to get the right diagnosis as early as you can to start treatment to bring your cholesterol levels down. If you or your child has any of these signs, talk to your doctor to see if you need to get checked for He FH: High LDL cholesterol on a blood test that won't go down with changes in diet. High means above 190 mg/d L in adults and 160 mg/d L in kids under 16. Family history of high cholesterol You have male relatives who had a heart attack or heart disease before 60, or female relatives who had it before 70. Xanthomas, or bumps under the skin of your elbows, knees, or knuckles Swollen Achilles tendons just above your heels Sore, swollen feet Yellow or white patches on your eyes Chest pain Your doctor will ask about any medical problems that you or your relatives have. Tell your doctor if any of your parents, grandparents, or other family members have had high cholesterol or heart attacks. Even aunts, uncles, or cousins with these problems could be a sign that He FH is a concern for your family. Your doctor or your child's pediatrician will also do a physical exam to look for signs of the disease. He'll check for: Yellowish cholesterol deposits on the skin around your elbows, knees, or knuckles Swollen tendons on the backs of your ankles, above your heels Yellow areas or white spots in your eyes Blood tests. You or your child may get a blood test called a lipid panel. You'll learn your total cholesterol number and also find out your levels of HDL ""good"" cholesterol and LDL ""bad cholesterol. It also reveals your levels of a blood fat called triglycerides. If your total cholesterol level is above 300 mg/d L, or your child's is above 250 mg/d L, it's one sign of He FH. LDL cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/d L are another sign. Your doctor can also rule out other causes for your high cholesterol, like your diet, or give you blood tests to check for kidney, liver, or thyroid problems. Heart tests. An abnormal stress test may be a clue that you have heart disease. This exam shows how well your ticker works when you rev it up. You'll walk on a treadmill while your doctor tracks your heartbeat. Genetic test. The most common genetic sign of He FH is a mutation, or change, in your LDLR gene. That's the gene that affects your cholesterol levels. Changes in these other genes could also suggest you have He FH: Apolipoprotein B-100 PCSK9 LDLRAP1 You'll need to give a small sample of tissue for this test. You can swab the inside of your cheek to scrape off a few cells, which get sent to a lab to see what gene changes you may have. Babies can get a small skin prick on the heel to collect a little blood instead of a cheek swab. If high cholesterol or heart attacks run in your family, everyone can be tested for these gene problems. It's important to spot He FH as early as you can because it can cause heart attacks at a young age. Get the right diagnosis so you can start treatments as soon as possible. While kids may not be at risk for a heart attack, their high cholesterol levels put them at risk for heart disease later on. Early treatment or lifestyle changes can help your child lower his cholesterol and stay healthy."
506,"Juvenile arthritis is a disease in which there is inflammation (swelling) of the synovium in children aged 16 or younger. The synovium is the tissue that lines the inside of joints. Juvenile arthritis is an autoimmune disease. That means the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign substances, attacks the body instead. The disease is also idiopathic, which means that no exact cause is known. Researchers believe juvenile arthritis may be related to genetics, certain infections, and environmental triggers. There are five types of juvenile arthritis: Systemic arthritis, also called Still's disease, can affect the entire body or involve many systems of the body. Systemic juvenile arthritis usually causes high fever and a rash. The rash is usually on the trunk, arms, and legs. Systemic juvenile arthritis can also affect internal organs, such as the heart, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, but usually not the eyes. Boys and girls are equally affected. Oligoarthritis, also called pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, affects fewer than five joints in the first six months that the child has the disease. The joints most commonly affected are the knee, ankle, and wrist. Oligoarthritis can affect the eye, most often the iris. This is known as uveitis, iridocyclitis, or iritis. This type of arthritis is more common in girls than in boys, and many children will outgrow this disease by the time they become adults. Polyarthritis, also called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (p JIA), involves five or more joints in the first six months of the disease -- often the same joints on each side of the body. This type of arthritis can affect the joints in the jaw and neck as well as those in the hands and feet. This type also is also more common in girls than in boys and more closely resembles the adult form. Psoriatic arthritis affects children who have both arthritis and the skin disorder psoriasis. The child might get either the psoriasis or the arthritis years before developing the other part of the disease. Children with this type of arthritis often have pitted fingernails. Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of arthritis that often afflicts the spine, hips, eyes, and entheses (the places where tendons attach to bones). This type of arthritis occurs mainly in boys older than 8 years of age. There is often a family history of arthritis of the back (called ankylosing spondylitis) among the child's male relatives. Children with juvenile arthritis can have no symptoms at all. Symptoms may also vary depending on the type of arthritis. Symptoms of juvenile arthritis may include: Joint stiffness, especially in the morning Pain, swelling, and tenderness in the joints Limping ( In younger children, it may appear that the child is not able to perform motor skills he or she recently learned.) Persistent fever Rash Weight loss Fatigue Irritability Eye redness or eye pain Blurred vision Because a child may have no symptoms of juvenile arthritis, and because some of the symptoms can be associated with other diseases, a diagnosis may be difficult. Because there is no actual test for juvenile arthritis, the diagnosis is made by excluding other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as bone disorders or breaks, fibromyalgia, infection, Lyme disease, lupus, or cancer. The doctor is likely to begin by taking a complete medical history and performing a complete medical exam. Additional testing might be useful in determining what type of arthritis the child has. Some of the other tests that might be ordered include: Complete blood count (white cells, red cells, and platelets) Lab tests on blood or urine X-rays (to rule out breaks or damage to bones) Imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans Blood culture to check for bacteria, which could indicate an infection in the bloodstream Tests for viruses Tests for Lyme disease Bone marrow exam, which is used to check for leukemia Erythrocyte sedimentation rate to see how quickly the red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube ( The rate is faster in most people who have a disease that causes inflammation.) Test for rheumatoid factor, an antibody that may be found in people with arthritis ( An abnormal result is more common in adults than in children.) Antinuclear antibody test to show evidence of autoimmunity ( Autoimmunity is a disease state in which the body's defense system, the immune system, malfunctions and attacks the body itself. This test is also useful in predicting if eye disease will develop in children with juvenile arthritis.) Bone scan to detect changes in bones and joints ( This test may be ordered if the symptoms include unexplained pain in the joints and bone.) Joint fluid sampling and synovial tissue sampling, which might be performed by an orthopedic surgeon Treatment for juvenile arthritis generally includes both exercise and medications. The treatment plans are also based on the type of juvenile arthritis. For instance, children who have polyarticular juvenile arthritis and who have a positive result on the rheumatoid factor test have the potential for more joint damage and may need more aggressive treatment. In general, though, treatment for juvenile arthritis has several main goals: To relieve pain To reduce swelling To increase joint mobility and strength To prevent joint damage and complications The following types of drugs may be used to treat juvenile arthritis: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) are used to treat pain and swelling. There are NSAIDs available over the counter and others that are prescription only. NSAIDs include products such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Possible side effects are nausea and stomach ache; these drugs should be taken with food. Aspirin is included in the NSAID category, but is rarely prescribed for treating arthritis. Slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs ( SAARDs) are used to treat pain and swelling over time and usually take several weeks or more to work. These drugs are also called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). The doctor may prescribe drugs in this category in combination with NSAIDs. Lab tests to check for possible side effects are usually necessary. One of the most commonly used DMARDs is methotrexate ( Rheumatrex). Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil), sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine), and drugs that block tumor necrosis factor ( TNF), also called anti- TNF drugs. Etanercept ( Enbrel) and etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) are examples of anti- TNF medication used to treat juvenile arthritis. Corticosteroids are also used to treat pain and swelling. Sometimes, before any other treatment is tried, steroids are given as an injection into the affected joint. In certain cases, the doctor might prescribe oral steroids (taken by mouth), but these are generally avoided in children because of adverse side effects, which may include poor growth and weight gain. Antimetabolites are a type of drug that is an aggressive therapy aimed at helping reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. The new drug Xatmep is an oral form of methotrexate that can be used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients, usually when NSAIDs have been proven to be ineffective."
507,"The hydrogen breath test is a method used to diagnose lactose intolerance or determine if abnormal bacteria are present in the colon. Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. It causes cramping, bloating, gas, or diarrhea any time dairy products are consumed. Lactose intolerance occurs due to the body's lack of lactase, an enzyme normally produced by the small intestine that is needed to digest lactose. During the hydrogen breath test, which takes about 2 hours, you will be asked to drink a lactose-containing beverage. The beverage may cause cramping, bloating, gas, or diarrhea. Fifteen minutes after drinking the beverage, you will be instructed to blow up balloon-like bags every 15 minutes for two hours. The air you breathe into these bags is tested frequently for the presence of hydrogen. Normally, very little is detected in breath. However, hydrogen and other gases are produced when undigested lactose in the colon is fermented by bacteria. Raised hydrogen breath levels indicate the improper digestion of lactose, which could lead to a diagnosis of lactose intolerance or the presence of abnormal bacteria in the colon. Before the hydrogen breath test, tell your doctor if: You have just had a colonoscopy; if so, you will need to wait a few weeks after the colonoscopy before this test can be performed. You are pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, have any diseases, or if you are allergic to any medications Do not eat or drink anything (including water) for at least 12 hours before the hydrogen breath test. If you need to take medicine, take only with a small sip of water 12 hours before the procedure. Do not take any antibiotics for 2-4 weeks before the test. Take only the medications approved by your doctor before the procedure. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. Do not chew gum on the day of the test. Your doctor may have other recommendations in addition to, or instead of, the ones listed above. Ask your doctor to provide you with written instructions prior to your test. You may resume your normal activities and diet after a hydrogen breath test. A health care provider will discuss the results of the test with you."
508,"During this time, your baby will push himself into a sitting position, where he can reach for and explore toys, books, and new activities. Help him develop skills like clapping with patty-cake and other hand games. Your baby is on the move! During this time, she may start crawling, creeping on her tummy, or scooting on her bottom. Don't worry about her style. As long as she uses arms and legs on both sides of her body to move, it's OK. Encourage motoring by putting an interesting toy just beyond her reach. Rocking on his hands and knees is your baby's last step before crawling. He's building his arm and leg muscles so they can propel him forward (or backward). Give him lots of supervised time out of the crib, car seat, and stroller so he can work on moving. When she can sit well without support (usually about 7 months), your baby will learn to lean over onto all fours. Soon, she'll push off with her knees to crawl. As she becomes agile, set out pillows, cushions, and boxes for her to crawl over and around. Always supervise this activity! Your baby is ""cruising"" -- walking while holding onto furniture to steady him. Make sure sharp corners are padded and furniture is secured. Hold your baby's hands while he walks to help him practice. Or let him push a sturdy walking toy with supervision. His first steps alone are just around the corner. At around 8-12 months, your baby's torso and leg muscles are strong enough for her to stand without assistance. Rolling over, sitting up on her own, and crawling have boosted her confidence. Make sure toxic products and medicines are locked away and safety gates are up. Your baby is moving from the raking grasp to a precise finger-and-thumb pincer grasp. For practice, give him little finger foods to pick up -- like cooked peas or O-shaped cereal. Keep away choking hazards, including older children's small toys and foods like grapes, nuts, and raw vegetables. Your baby's hands are busy, putting objects in and out of containers and banging them together. You don't need to invest in a drum set yet. Just about anything safe will work, including pots and pans, plastic containers and wooden spoons, and egg cartons. Your baby has made her first scribbles -- some marks on a piece of paper! She's imitating what her parents and older siblings do. Encourage her to doodle on the sidewalk with thick sidewalk chalk. Or set her up to scribble with fat, sturdy crayons and thick paper. Though he isn't using words yet, your baby uses his body to talk. He points to things and may nod his head ""yes"" or ""no."" He may pause when you say "" No!"" and "" Uh-oh."" He may wave ""bye-bye."" Help him learn words with rhymes, songs, and books. Name objects for him often. Did baby say her first word? Was it ""dada""? If so, don't take it personally, Mom. She's stringing sounds together now, and ""m"" is harder to pronounce than ""d."" In fact, she probably stumbled upon ""dada"" by accident. But very soon she'll be saying both ""mama"" and ""dada"" and meaning it. A few months ago, if you hid a toy under a blanket while baby was watching, she'd do nothing. Now, she finds it easily. She's learning ""object permanence"" -- that things exist even when she can't see them. Add a twist to peek-a-boo: Throw a blanket over your head and let her pull it off to find you. Nearing 1 year of age, the baby who was banging on his play telephone not long ago is now dialing and holding the receiver to his ear. He's learning that objects have names and purposes. Give him a hairbrush, a cup, or a spoon, and see how he plays with them now. Your outgoing baby is suddenly anxious around others, even relatives and babysitters. Stranger anxiety is one of baby's first emotional milestones. Around new people or in new places, hold him and give him time to adjust. Ask relatives to let baby make the first move. With stranger anxiety comes the start of separation anxiety. Your baby is realizing that she's separate from you and that sometimes you aren't there. She may put up a big fuss, but don't sneak out. Always say ""good-bye"" and tell her you'll return. Eventually she'll realize that you always do. Your baby is imitating things that go way beyond mimicking faces and sounds now. When playing, he enjoys imitating what people do -- whether it's talking on the phone or sweeping the floor. Give him a plastic bowl and spoon and let him ""cook"" with you or let him ""drive"" with a toy car dashboard. With baby finger-feeding herself, make sure it's food she can gum. This includes some cereals, shredded cheese, and small pieces of tofu, well-cooked fruits or vegetables, or ripe banana. Avoid foods like raw vegetables, hard fruits, whole grapes, raisins, popcorn, hard cheese, and hot dogs."
509,"Here are simple ways you can ease osteoarthritis symptoms on your own, at home. 1. Stay active. Exercise may be the last thing you want to do when your arthritis hurts. But many studies show that physical activity is one of the best ways to improve your quality of life. Exercise boosts your energy. It can also strengthen your muscles and bones, and help keep your joints flexible. Try resistance training to build stronger muscles. Your muscles protect and support joints affected by arthritis. Go for aerobic workouts to burn calories, which will help you lose weight. Maintaining a healthy weight relieves stress on painful joints. Of course, if you're experiencing a bad flare-up, it may be better not to exercise until the pain subsides. 2. Eat a balanced diet. Studies show that a variety of nutrients may help ease arthritis symptoms. Foods rich in vitamin C, especially fruits and vegetables, may help. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish and fish oil, may also help relieve pain. Experts say it's best to focus on healthy foods rather than on single nutrients. You can get all the nutrients you need simply by following a balanced diet. Make sure your menu includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, fish, and lean meats such as turkey and pork tenderloin. Also, choose healthy fats, such as nuts and avocados, and healthy oils, including olive and canola oil. 3. Lose weight. Being overweight puts undue strain on weight-bearing joints such as your knees, spine, hips, ankles, and feet. Losing weight can ease symptoms of arthritis. Shedding pounds and keeping them off isn't easy. Think baby steps. Make small changes each day that help you eat smaller portions and burn more calories. 4. Sleep well. A good night's sleep will help you cope with the pain and stress of arthritis. To sleep better, try going to bed at the same time every night. Take distractions like television and computers out of your bedroom. If you're uncomfortable in bed because of arthritis, try using pillows to take the pressure off painful joints. If you have frequent sleep problems, talk to your doctor. 5. Use hot or cold packs. By increasing blood flow, hot compresses can ease pain and stiffness. Cold compresses reduce swelling. You may want to experiment with heat versus cold packs to see what works best for you. 6. Keep pain under control. Over-the-counter medications can help ease arthritis pain. One of the most common is acetaminophen ( Tylenol and store brands) because it doesn't upset the stomach. However, taking more than recommended increases the chance of side effects, including liver problems. Other over-the-counter medications can also help, including aspirin, ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin), or naproxen sodium ( Aleve and store brands). Possible side effects include stomach irritation and bleeding. Read labels carefully to make sure you're taking the medication correctly. Also, don't take any pain reliever for more than 10 days without talking to your doctor. 7. Talk to your doctor about supplements and complementary medicine. Many supplements have been tested for the treatment of arthritis. Glucosamine and SAMe show the most promise. Glucosamine, often along with chondroitin, has helped improve pain in some studies, but not in others. Some medical research shows that SAMe, a chemical found in the body, may work as well as some over-the-counter medications, although more research is needed. If you do try supplements, you may need to take them for a month or more before you feel the full effects. People with arthritis also turn to treatments such as acupuncture and massage. Acupuncture has been shown to ease knee pain and improve function. Massage can increase blood flow and warmth to painful joints. Be sure to seek out a skilled practitioner who has experience working with people with arthritis. 8. Try splints, braces, and other aids. Devices that support painful joints, such as splints, braces, and canes can help ease your discomfort and prevent injury. Other items such as electric can openers and shower chairs can also help make your everyday life easier. 9. Seek support. Living with arthritis isn't easy. Finding other people you can talk to and share ideas with can help. Check out arthritis support groups online or in your area. 10. Stay positive. Your mental outlook can have a big impact on how you feel and how well you function. Every day, try to do something you enjoy. Spend time with friends. Develop hobbies that you can do even with arthritis. Focus on your abilities rather than your disabilities."
510,"Your doctor says you need to make some changes in your life, especially with your diet and exercise. Perhaps you're wondering: Will it really make a difference? Do you really need to make those changes if you're taking medicine for your heart? The answer is yes. Your lifestyle does matter -- a lot. Your doctor, or a dietitian, should have given you guidelines for your diet. They may have mentioned DASH ( Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), which helps to lower blood pressure, or TLC ( Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes), which focuses on lowering your cholesterol levels. On either plan, you'll: Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, poultry, fish, and low-fat dairy products Eat less total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol Limit the amount of red meat, sweets, and sweetened beverages you eat Another cornerstone is cutting back on salt. Lowering the amount of salt you eat can help lower the amount of fluid your body holds onto. This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to do its work. Getting no more than 1,500 milligrams per day (about a quarter-teaspoon of table salt) helps the most. Try these tips: Read labels. Look for ""salt,"" ""sodium,"" ""sea salt,"" and ""kosher salt."" Rinse salty canned food such as tuna before using it. Substitute herbs and spices for sodium and salt when cooking. Avoid instant or flavored side dishes, which usually have a lot of added sodium. Instead, try cooking plain rice, pasta, or grains without adding salt. You can add other flavorings or a bit of salt when you serve them. Look for ""low sodium"" on food labels. If you have heart disease, becoming more active is one of the best things you can do for yourself. It helps with your blood pressure and weight, and it makes your heart stronger. Getting even as little as 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days helps. You can do anything that makes your heart beat a little faster, whether it's walking, water aerobics, washing your car, or something else. Before you start, check with your doctor to see if there are activities that aren't appropriate for you. Then choose activities that you enjoy and that you can work into your day. You don't have to do the same thing every day. You might find it easier to stay motivated if you involve friends or family members in your activities. Is alcohol good or bad for you? That depends. Here's the bad side of alcohol use: Drinking too much alcohol can make heart disease worse. Alcohol can: Raise your blood pressure Increase your chances of stroke Increase your risk of dying if you have a heart attack Damage your heart muscle and lead to heart failure On the other hand, moderate use of alcohol may have these two benefits: Lower your blood pressure two to four points Increase the levels of HDL good cholesterol in your blood "" Moderate"" drinking means the following: No more than two drinks per day for men No more than one drink per day for women If you don't drink now, health experts usually don't recommend that you start. Check with your doctor for advice that's specific to you. For some people, the potential problems from drinking may outweigh the possible advantages of moderate alcohol use."
511,"Farmer's lung is a disease caused by an allergy to the mold in certain crops. Farmers are most likely to get it because it's usually caused by breathing in dust from hay, corn, grass for animal feed, grain, tobacco, or some pesticides. Not everyone gets farmer's lung after breathing in these things. It only happens if you have an allergic reaction. Your doctor may use another name for your condition. It's also called extrinsic allergic alveolitis, hypersensitivity alveolitis, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The ""-itis"" at the end of these names means it causes inflammation. With farmer's lung, the inflammation, or swelling, is in your lungs. Farmer's lung can cause three kinds of allergic reactions. An acute attack is an intense reaction that happens 4 to 8 hours after you breathe in mold. Symptoms include: Dry irritating cough Fever and chills Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Sudden feeling that you're sick A sub-acute attack is less intense and comes on more slowly than an acute attack. Symptoms include: Achy muscles and joints Coughing Mild fever with some chills No appetite Shortness of breath Weight loss You may mistake acute or sub-acute farmer's lung for the flu, because many of the symptoms are the same. Chronic farmer's lung happens after you've had many acute attacks and are around large amounts of moldy dust often. When you reach this point, your lungs may have permanent damage. Symptoms include: Cough that won't go away Depression General aches and pains Night sweats No appetite and gradual weight loss Occasional fever Shortness of breath that gets worse over time Weakness and loss of energy Most people with acute or subacute farmer's lung get better; only a small percentage of people develop chronic farmer's lung. Farmers may notice that their symptoms get worse in the winter. Storing animal feed like hay, grass, or grain inside makes mold more likely to grow. Plus, there's no breeze or wind to clear it out of the air. It's common for farmers to get this disease from moldy hay and other crops. But you also can get it from dust in things like: Animal dander Bacteria Bark Bird droppings Dried rat urine Feathers Fungi Husks Insects Wood These allergens have to be very small -- around 5 millionths of a meter (5 microns) -- to affect you. Because the particles are so tiny, the normal defenses in your nose and throat miss them, and they go straight to your lungs. Your lungs then try to get rid of the dust, and your symptoms start when your immune system reacts to that. The most important questions your doctor will ask you will be about your environment. If you're not a farmer, it may be harder to figure out that farmer's lung is causing your symptoms. It can also be hard to know what's going on if you're not having an acute attack. Your doctor can give you a blood test to look for certain things that trigger your immune system (called antigens) or order a chest X-ray to look for signs that you've had acute attacks. Other things your doctor can do to find out if you have farmer's lung include: Pulmonary function test: This measures how much air you inhale and exhale. Bronchoscopy: Your doctor uses a device called a bronchoscope to look at your airways and lungs and collect a sample of fluid for testing. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep through this. Lung biopsy: If your doctor thinks you might have farmer's lung but can't be sure, he may want to take a sample of your lung tissue and send it to a lab for tests. You'll probably be given medicine to sleep through this as well. There's no cure for farmer's lung, but you can control it by staying away from the allergen that causes your symptoms. You might: Work outside as much as possible Avoid dusty work Wear a mask or other protective equipment Use fans, filters, or exhaust blowers wherever you can Steroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone, Orasone, Meticorten) can help with your symptoms because they can slow down your immune system and help with inflammation. Your doctor may only prescribe these if you have a chronic case, though. If steroids don't work, your doctor may want to prescribe and immune suppressant such as a drug called azathrioprine ( Azasan). In addition to recommending that you avoid your triggers, your doctor may also recommend bed rest or oxygen therapy, which involves getting extra oxygen through tubes in your nose or a mask, to help you feel better."
512,"It can be scary to learn that you have cancer. But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you. Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes. Your stage of a cancer won't be changed if your cancer gets worse or comes back. Your doctor will always refer to it by the stage it was when it was diagnosed."

Stress hormones can raise your blood sugar. When you can take care of stress, you can lower your blood sugar. Plus, with less stress you can have the energy you need to eat right, exercise, and check your blood sugar. Having ways to bust stress can also help you sleep better. That's great because when you don't get enough sleep it's not good for your blood sugar. That can make it rise. Try these to help keep stress in check and your diabetes under control: Recommended Related to Diabetes Scratches, Scrapes, Cuts, and Diabetes If you have diabetes, your eyes might be your best medicine when it comes to protecting your skin. Act quickly to treat any small cut, scrape, or scratch to make sure it heals properly, says James L. Roth, MD. He's a family physician in Johns Creek, GA. Check your body daily for even small wounds so you can treat them right away. â You have to keep it clean, keep it covered, and keep looking at it to see if it's getting better or getting worse,â he says. â If it's not healing within two days, if... Read the Scratches, Scrapes, Cuts, and Diabetes article > > Relaxation exercise. Close your eyes while sitting in a comfortable chair or lying down. Starting with your toes, slowly clench one body part at a time. Hold for 5 seconds and relax. Keep going until you've tightened and relaxed every part of your body. Deep breathing. Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Then close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, filling up your lungs. Hold for a few seconds. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Let all the air out of your lungs like you're letting air out of a balloon. Repeat many times. Manage Diabetes With Stress Reduction Music. Relaxing music can ease anxiety and depression and lower your blood pressure. Find music that calms you, then put on your headphones and relax. You can make playlists of some of your favorite stress-busting songs so you have them ready when you need them. Keep them separate from the workout music that gets you pumped up to exercise. Yoga. Slowly relax into a downward dog pose or a warrior's pose. This forces you to focus on your breathing, stretching, and how you place your body. It loosens tight muscles and turns your thoughts away from the stresses in your life. Consider taking a yoga class at a gym or a local community center. Or, do a yoga routine through an active video game on a system like the Wii. If you don't have time for a full class, even 5 or 10 minutes of yoga posing or breathing can help ease stress. Exercise. Think about what kinds of exercise help you relieve stress. For some people, running and hard-hitting sports push away their worries. For others, taking a quiet walk or a bike ride is calming. Exercise doesn't just help you fight stress. It can lower your blood pressure and help you lose any extra pounds. Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise program. Ask what type of exercise might be best for you. Hobbies. Fight stress by forgetting about it. Lose yourself in a favorite pastime. Do something that relaxes you, like reading or painting."
514,"An adhesion is a band of scar tissue that binds 2 parts of your tissue that are not normally joined together. Adhesions may appear as thin sheets of tissue similar to plastic wrap or as thick fibrous bands. The tissue develops when the body's repair mechanisms respond to any tissue disturbance, such as surgery, infection, trauma, or radiation. Although adhesions can occur anywhere, the most common locations are within the stomach, the pelvis, and the heart. Abdominal adhesions: Abdominal adhesions are a common complication of surgery, occurring in up to 93% of people who undergo abdominal or pelvic surgery. Abdominal adhesions also occur in about 10% of people who have never had surgery. Most adhesions are painless and do not cause complications. However, adhesions cause about 60% of small bowel obstructions in adults and are believed to contribute to the development of chronic pelvic pain. Adhesions typically begin to form within the first few days after surgery, but they may not produce symptoms for months or even years. As scar tissue begins to restrict motion of the small intestines, passing food through the digestive system becomes progressively more difficult. The bowel may become blocked. In extreme cases, adhesions may form fibrous bands around a segment of an intestine. This constricts blood flow and leads to tissue death. Pelvic adhesions: Pelvic adhesions may involve any organ within the pelvis, such as the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, or bladder, and usually occur after surgery. Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) results from an infection (usually a sexually transmitted disease) that frequently leads to adhesions within the fallopian tubes. A woman's eggs pass through her fallopian tubes into her uterus for reproduction. Fallopian adhesions can lead to infertility and increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy in which a fetus develops outside the uterus. Endometriosis, a condition in which tissue normally found inside the uterus grows in other parts of the body such as the bowel or fallopian tubes, may also be caused by pelvic adhesions. Heart adhesions: Scar tissue may form within the membranes that surround the heart (pericardial sac), thus restricting heart function. Infections, such as rheumatic fever, may lead to adhesions forming on heart valves and can lead to decreased heart efficiency. Adhesions develop as the body attempts to repair itself. This normal response can occur after surgery, infection, trauma, or radiation. Repair cells within the body cannot tell the difference between one organ and another. If an organ undergoes repair and comes into contact with another part of itself, or another organ, scar tissue may form to connect the 2 surfaces. Doctors associate signs and symptoms of adhesions with the problems an adhesion causes rather than from an adhesion directly. As a result, people experience many complaints based on where an adhesion forms and what it may disrupt. Typically, adhesions show no symptoms and go undiagnosed. Most commonly, adhesions cause pain by pulling nerves, either within an organ tied down by an adhesion or within the adhesion itself. Adhesions above the liver may cause pain with deep breathing. Intestinal adhesions may cause pain due to obstruction during exercise or when stretching. Adhesions involving the vagina or uterus may cause pain during intercourse. Pericardial adhesions may cause chest pain. It is important to note that not all pain is caused by adhesions and not all adhesions cause pain. Small bowel obstruction (intestinal blockage) due to adhesions is a surgical emergency. These adhesions may trigger waves of cramplike pain in your stomach. This pain, which can last seconds to minutes, often worsens if you eat food, which increases activity of the intestines. Once the pain starts, you may vomit. This often relieves the pain. Your stomach may become tender and progressively bloated. You may hear high-pitched tinkling bowel sounds over your stomach, accompanied by increased gas and loose stools. Fever is usually minimal. Such intestinal blockage can sometimes correct itself. However, you must see your doctor. If the blockage progresses, these conditions may develop: Your bowel stretches further. Pain becomes constant and severe. Bowel sounds disappear. Gas and bowel movements stop. Your belly becomes distended. Fever may increase. Further progression can tear your intestinal wall and contaminate your abdominal cavity with bowel contents. See a doctor any time you experience abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or unexplained fever. If you have undergone surgery or have a history of medical illness, discuss any changes in your recovery or condition with your doctor. Call 911 and go to the nearest emergency department if chest pain occurs. Doctors typically diagnose adhesions during a surgical procedure such as laparoscopy (putting a camera through a small hole into the stomach to visualize the organs). If they find adhesions, doctors usually can release them during the same surgery. Studies such as blood tests, x-rays, and CT scans may be useful to determine the extent of an adhesion-related problem. However, a diagnosis of adhesions usually is made only during surgery. A physician, for example, can diagnose small bowel obstruction but cannot determine if adhesions are the cause without surgery. Adhesions must be diagnosed and treated by a physician. Treatment varies depending on the location, extent of adhesion formation, and problems the adhesion is causing. Adhesions frequently improve without surgery. Therefore, unless a surgical emergency becomes evident, a doctor may treat symptoms rather than perform surgery. Two common surgical techniques used to treat abdominal adhesions are laparoscopy and laparotomy. With laparoscopy, a doctor places a camera into your body through a small hole in the skin to confirm that adhesions exist. The adhesions then are cut and released (adhesiolysis). In laparotomy, a doctor makes a larger incision to directly see adhesions and treat them. The technique varies depending on specific circumstances. If you have undergone surgery or have a history of medical illness, always discuss changes in your recovery or condition with your doctor. Steps are taken during surgery to try and minimize the formation of adhesions. Some of these may include: shortening surgical time, keeping the tissues moist, gentle handling of any tissues or organs, and using starch âfree and latex-free gloves. Several surgical products have also been developed to try to help prevent adhesions from forming during surgery. Film-like sheets are sometimes used between organs or body surfaces after large, open surgical procedures. Adhesions requiring surgery commonly come back because surgery itself causes adhesions. adhesion, pelvic adhesion, heart adhesion, pericardial adhesion, intrauterine adhesion, tissue disturbance, surgery, infection, trauma, radiation, scar tissue, small-bowel obstruction, pelvic pain, chronic pelvic pain, intestinal adhesion, general adhesion, general adhesions, adhesion after surgery, adhesions after surgery, abdominal adhesion, adhesion causes, adhesion symptoms"
515,"Bipolar disorder and depression have many similarities. But they also have some key differences. It's important to know how to tell one from the other to get the right treatment. Depression is more than just feeling low. It's a deep sadness or emptiness you can't shake. You might feel hopeless, worthless, and restless. You might lose interest in things that you used to enjoy. Depression (also called major depressive disorder or MDD) often goes hand-in-hand with sleep problems, changes in appetite, and trouble concentrating. It can lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. People who suffer with depression might have some days that are better than others. But without proper treatment, their mood tends to remain low. Bipolar disorder (sometimes called manic depression) is different. If you have it, you have extreme mood swings. You experience periods of depression (similar to MDD). But you also have periods of great highs. Bipolar refers to the opposite ends, or poles, of the emotional spectrum -- the highs (mania) and the lows (depression). You might be severely depressed for a period of hours, days, weeks, or even months before entering a manic period. The mania could range from several days to two months or longer. It's also possible to have a type of bipolar disorder in which you experience manic and depressive symptoms at the same time. You might feel sad and hopeless but also be very agitated and restless. The highs of bipolar disorder might feel enjoyable. But they also can be dangerous. Risky behavior could put you in physical danger. And mania is usually followed by extreme depression. About 6 million American adults have bipolar disorder. That might sound like a lot. But it's much rarer than depression, which affects slightly over 16 million American adults. If you have bipolar disorder and are having a manic episode, you might be very energetic, get very little sleep because you're so wired, and find yourself talking faster because your thoughts are racing. You might feel like the world's best multitasker. You might also take risks that you normally wouldn't take. Examples could include going on a spending spree or driving recklessly. Sometimes this kind of behavior is easy to spot, but not always. That's especially true if you have a milder form of a high, called hypomania. You might feel good, be happy that you're extra energetic, and think that you're just being productive. Friends and family members may be better able to notice that you're acting out of character. Getting the correct diagnosis isn't always easy. A mental health expert who only sees you at your low points might not know about your manic behavior unless you or someone who knows you well brings it up. And some people with bipolar disorder may also have additional conditions that make both diagnosis and treatment more challenging. Examples include substance abuse or an anxiety or eating disorder. If you think you might have bipolar disorder, it's important to raise your concerns with a mental health expert and work closely with her to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Proper treatment is often a combination of counseling and medication. It's the best way to manage your symptoms. A mood stabilizing medication, such as lithium or divalproex is often used to manage bipolar disorder. Some people take antidepressants in addition to a mood stabilizer or an antipsychotic medication. Taking an antidepressant by itself could actually trigger a manic episode. That's another important reason to figure out if you have bipolar disorder or depression. Over time, your condition may shift and your medications may need to be tweaked. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to track your symptoms. By recording your daily mood, sleep patterns, life events, and other details, it may help you and your provider stay on top of your condition and make sure that you get the most effective treatment possible."
516,"As you get older, chances are you'll sometimes forget a word, where you left your car keys, or the name of a neighbor you bumped into at the market. These small memory lapses happen. They're a normal part of aging -- just like creaky knees, wrinkled skin, or blurry vision. It can help to: Write yourself notes. Place your keys in the same place each day. Play word games or do crossword puzzles. Because loss of memory is also a symptom of Alzheimer's disease, you might worry that these lapses are a sign of something more serious. Alzheimer's, which affects some 5 million Americans, most of them over 65, is irreversible. In most cases, there's no great cause for worry. Just because you lose your keys or forget someone's name doesn't mean you have Alzheimer's. You could have memory loss due to the normal aging process. Conditions that contribute to memory loss include: Depression Medication side effects Alcohol abuse Not enough vitamin B12 or a low thyroid level Stress and worry of any kind, such as from the death of a spouse or loved one, or from retirement Illness One symptom of more serious memory loss is that you're not aware there's a problem. Family members might seem more worried than you are. If loved ones are talking to you about your memory, take their concerns to heart and see a doctor. Here's a checklist for what's normal, along with causes for concern. Normal: You forget daily appointments but remember them later. Cause for concern: You ask friends and family for details over and over again, or need them to do tasks that you used to do yourself. Normal: You make a mistake balancing your checkbook. Cause for concern: You have trouble planning or solving problems that used to be easy. It's hard to do things that involve numbers, like follow a recipe or pay monthly bills. Normal: You need help once in a while with the microwave settings or a TV remote. Cause for concern: You can't work the stove or drive to a familiar spot. Normal: You forget what day of the week it is but remember later. Cause for concern: You find yourself in a place and don't know how you got there. Normal: You have age-related vision changes. You get a cataract, for instance. Cause for concern: You have problems with distance, color, or perception. You pass a mirror and don't know your own reflection. Normal: You can't find the right word immediately. Cause for concern: You call things by the wrong names. You stop in the middle of a sentence and have no idea what you were saying. Normal: You misplace your glasses or the remote from time to time. Cause for concern: You put things in weird places, and you can't retrace your steps to find them. Or, you accuse others of stealing. Normal: You make a bad decision from time to time. Cause for concern: You make bad choices with money often. You don't groom or keep yourself clean. Normal: You feel tired of work, family, and social demands sometimes. Cause for concern: You can't keep up with the teams or hobbies you like. You try not to spend time with others because of the changes you've been through. Normal: You have your ways of doing things and get grumpy when you're derailed. Cause for concern: You get upset easily, when your routine changes, or when you're out of your comfort zone. You're often confused, anxious, suspicious, depressed, or afraid."
517,"OCD doesn't go away on its own, and it has no cure. You can't ignore it or think your way out of the repetitive thoughts and behaviors that control your life. What you can control is your decision to get treatment. The first step is to see your doctor. An exam will show if your symptoms are the result of a physical issue. If they're not, your doctor can recommend a mental illness specialist, like a psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker, who can create a plan for you. For many people, combining talk therapy and medication works best. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT). OCD has a cycle: obsessions, anxiety, compulsions, and relief. CBT, a type of psychotherapy, gives you tools to think, act, and react to your unhealthy thoughts and habits. The goal is to replace negative thoughts with productive ones. Exposure and response prevention ( ERP). This is a specific form of CBT. As the name suggests, you'll be exposed to the things that trigger your anxiety, a little at a time. You'll learn new ways to respond to them in place of your repetitive rituals. ERP is a process you may do one-on-one with your mental health professional or in group therapy, either by yourself or with your family there. Medication. Antidepressants are often the first medications prescribed for OCD. Your doctor may have you try clomipramine ( Anafranil), fluoxetine ( Prozac), fluvoxamine ( Luvox), paroxetine ( Paxil), sertraline ( Zoloft), or another antidepressant, depending on your age, health, and symptoms. It can take a couple of months for OCD drugs to start to work. They also can give you side effects, like dry mouth, nausea, and thoughts of suicide. Call your doctor or 911 right away if you have thoughts about killing yourself. Take your medication regularly on schedule. If you don't like the side effects or if you feel better and want to stop taking your medicine, ask your doctor how to taper off safely. If you miss a few doses or stop cold turkey, you could have side effects or a relapse. Other treatment. Sometimes OCD doesn't respond well to medication or therapy. Experimental treatments for severe cases of OCD include: Clinical trials. You could join research trials to test unproven therapies. Deep brain stimulation, where you get electrodes surgically implanted in your brain Electroconvulsive therapy. Electrodes attached to your head give you electric shocks to start seizures, which make your brain release hormones like serotonin. Your treatment goals for OCD are to retrain you brain and to control your symptoms with the least amount of medication possible. Set yourself up for success physically by eating healthy food, exercising, and getting enough sleep. Emotional support matters, too: Surround yourself with encouraging family, friends, and people who understand OCD."
518," If you have arthritis, you may have considered a cortisone shot as part of your treatment plan. These shots are not pain relievers. Cortisone is a type of steroid, a drug that lowers inflammation, which is something that can lead to less pain. Cortisone injections can be used to treat inflammation of small areas of the body, such as inflammation of a specific joint or tendon. They can also treat inflammation that is widespread throughout the body, such as with allergic reactions, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects many joints. You can get cortisone shots at your doctor's office. They offer quick relief for inflammation that's just in one part of your body -- for instance, a knee or elbow affected by arthritis. A single injection can avoid certain side effects, notably stomach irritation, that can happen with other anti-inflammation drugs. Short-term side effects are rare, but they can include the following: Shrinkage and lightening of the color of the skin where you get the shot Infection Bleeding from broken blood vessels in the skin or muscle Soreness where you get the shot Aggravation of inflammation in the area injected because of reactions to the medication (post injection flare) Tendons can be weakened by corticosteroid injections, and tendon ruptures have been reported. If you have diabetes, cortisone injections can raise your blood sugar. If you have an infection, these shots can make it harder to recover. You may not be able to get this treatment if you have problems with blood clotting. Long-term side effects depend on the dose and how often you get this treatment. With higher doses and frequent shots, potential side effects include: Thinning of the skin Easy bruising Weight gain Puffiness of the face Higher blood pressure Cataract formation Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) Rare but serious damage to the bones of the large joints (called âavascular necrosisâ). The doctor, nurse, or other health professional will use an alcohol or iodine-based cleaning solution to clean the area of your skin where you'll get the shot. After that, they will put a numbing lotion or spray on that spot. Then you'll get the shot. Afterward, you'll wear a bandage over the injection site. If the shot is going into a joint that has too much fluid, your doctor will first use a separate syringe and needle to draw out the extra fluid. When an expert does it, you should only feel a little pain."
519,"After you get a breast cancer operation, it's more important than ever to take care of yourself. Good nutrition and exercise can help you regain your health. Nausea and vomiting are common after surgery, and you're even more likely to have these symptoms if you've also had chemotherapy or radiation. Other symptoms include a loss of appetite or desire to eat, and ""wasting syndrome,"" when your body wastes away from lack of nutrition. It's often accompanied by weight loss and weakness. To ease symptoms of nausea: Eat several smaller meals throughout the day instead of three big ones. Try protein shakes, yogurt, and liquid protein drinks instead of solid foods. Eat simple soups, such as chicken with vegetables and broth. Protein. Your body needs more of it than usual after your operation. It needs it to repair cells, fight infection, and heal incisions. Here's what you can do to get more: Add protein powder or dry milk to meals. Add grated cheese to vegetables, potatoes, rice, and salads. Eat high-protein snacks such as almonds, peanuts, and cheese. Right after surgery, boost your protein without worrying about calories. It will help you heal and get your strength back. If you need to lose weight, you can focus on that later. Phytochemicals are nutrients in plants. Some have been studied for their cancer-fighting benefits and their ability to keep cancer from coming back. Soy. Soybeans contain phytoestrogens. These are nutrients similar to the estrogen in your body. Sources of them include soybeans (edamame), tofu, soy milk, and miso soup. Some researchers think they can help protect against the kind of breast cancer that needs estrogen for its growth, but others don't. Ask your doctor whether eating one to three servings of soy a day would help you. It's possible it may interfere with hormone therapy or some other treatment. Antioxidants . Many vegetables, fruits, nuts, and other foods have them. Good choices include broccoli, liver, carrots, blueberries, and mangoes. Antioxidants protect your cells from damage. Dietitians say you should eat a balanced diet with a variety of fresh foods to get them. It's better for you than taking supplements. Lycopene. This is one type of antioxidant. It puts the red in tomatoes and the pink in pink grapefruit. It might help fight breast cancer. Beta-carotene. Carrots, apricots, yams, and other vegetables and fruits get their orange color from beta-carotene. Eating foods that have a lot of it may lower the risk of breast cancer returning, some studies suggest. A registered dietitian can give you advice on the best diet and nutrition plan for you, but these general guidelines will get you started. Eat low-fat protein, such as roasted chicken and baked fish, rather than steak, sausages, or other high-fat meats. Try to have five servings of a wide variety of vegetables and fruits each day. Avoid processed meats linked to cancer. These include bacon, bologna, hot dogs, ham, and smoked meats. Choose whole-grain bread and brown rice, rather than white bread and white rice. Cut back on alcohol. Limit yourself to one drink a day if you're a woman or two if you're a man. Talk to your doctor about any diet changes you're making, especially when recovering from surgery or when getting chemotherapy. You don't want to starve your body of important nutrients that it needs to recover. A good cardio workout improves your self-esteem, mood, and health. And after breast cancer surgery, you'll need to be active. Being overweight is linked to breast cancer coming back. Losing extra pounds through exercise may help you restore your health and improve your chances of avoiding more cancer. Fatigue often lingers after surgery. It may be worse if you've also had chemotherapy and radiation. Exercise can boost your energy. Most experts say some form of regular exercise is good, even if you start with short walks around the block. Protect yourself. For the first days and weeks after your surgery, you'll need to focus on protecting your incision and any other tender areas. Don't carry heavy things like children or groceries. Talk with your doctor before you start exercising. Once your doctor says you can, start slowly and carefully. Think about seeing a physical therapist experienced with breast cancer. A therapist can help you improve your range of motion, strength, and flexibility. If you had a lumpectomy to remove a breast lump, or surgery to remove part of your breast (a partial mastectomy), you can get back to exercise fairly quickly with your doctor's OK. If you had surgery to remove the lymph nodes under your arm, you're at higher risk of swelling of the arm, called lymphedema. This is especially true if you get radiation. That's because fluids can't drain the way they used to from your arm. Lymphedema can happen any time after surgery or radiation. So you may need to avoid things like tennis, running, and some styles of yoga that use your arms for several weeks. You'll need to protect your arm from injury, so you may need to avoid things like tennis, running, and some styles of yoga for some time. If you choose to have breast reconstruction, you may have several surgeries ahead of you. That may mean you'll have to put off exercise for longer. Choose an exercise you enjoy. The best workout for you is the one you'll stick with and enjoy -- and one that's safe, given your type of breast cancer surgery. Start with brisk walking. Or use a stationary bike so you can sit upright without leaning on your arms. Other exercises that don't require you to put weight on your arms include tai chi, qigong, and gentle yoga. Later, add more vigorous exercise that uses your arms more. You might opt to run, swim, cycle, hike, do more intense yoga, and other aerobic exercises. Aim to get 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week -- unless your doctor says not to. Go slowly and safely in the months after your surgery."
520,"When you have yet another migraine headache -- with a throbbing head and nausea -- you may wonder if you'll ever be free of them. Some people who get migraines do see their symptoms go away over time. Doctors don't fully understand what causes migraines, so there's no step-by-step plan to make them stop. But it is possible to go into remission (stop having migraines). If you get migraines, you may have them several times a month or even daily in some cases. If you have them at least 15 days a month, you have chronic migraine. If you have fewer than 15 a month but more than one a year, you have occasional migraine. For some, these attacks can go into either partial or full remission: Partial remission happens when people with chronic migraine suddenly get fewer of them. If you have one 10 days or less a month instead of 15 days, your doctor may say your chronic migraine has gone into remission. Full remission happens when people with occasional migraine go an entire year without one. Doctors don't know why some people with migraines go into remission. But research shows that certain things can make it more likely: Age: The number of migraine attacks you have each month is likely to drop over time. This is true for people 40 and older. Among women, a drop in hormone levels after menopause may be a factor. Being a man: Men are less likely to have migraines overall. But men who get them are more likely than women to go into remission. Your reaction to touch: Some people who get migraines become so sensitive to touch during an attack that feeling their clothing against their skin or someone lightly brushing against their shoulder is uncomfortable or even painful. If this doesn't happen when you have a migraine, you're more likely to go into remission. Number of headaches per month: Studies show that if you have chronic migraine, you're more likely to go into partial remission if you have fewer attacks. That means closer to 15 a month than to 30. Some research suggests that drugs that treat migraines don't lead to remission. But they can make symptoms milder and attacks less frequent. So they can be useful in helping control migraines, even if they don't stop them. In the future, researchers may study whether any drugs can help lower the number of monthly attacks to the point of remission."
