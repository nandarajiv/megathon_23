0,What should I do if I want to stop dialysis?,"But you can choose not to have it or stop at any time. If you do, make sure to talk to your doctor about other treatments that can help you. Changes to your diet or lifestyle may improve your quality of life. If you want to stop dialysis because you feel depressed or ashamed, your doctor may urge you to speak to a counselor first. Sharing your feelings, taking antidepressants, or doing both of these things may help you make a more informed decision."
0,What are the different kinds of peritoneal dialysis (PD)?,This process is called an âexchange.â There are two kinds of PD: Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis ( CCPD): This uses a machine to do your exchanges. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD): You'll do your exchanges by hand. You'll likely do four to six exchanges each day. Your doctor can help you decide which type fits your lifestyle. Some people do both.
0,What are some tips to stay healthy during dialysis?,"Hemodialysis patients are also at an increased risk for infections. Try these tips to stay healthy: Check your access site daily for redness, pus, and swelling. If you see any, call your doctor. Keep the bandage that covers your catheter clean and dry."
1,How can I prevent blood clots if I have polycythemia vera?,"Its symptoms may include: Pain in the upper right part of your belly Yellow color in your skin and the whites of your eyes Swelling in the belly or arms Bleeding in your digestive tract, from the esophagus or gut To prevent clots, your doctor will remove a small amount of blood with a treatment called phlebotomy. This is similar to giving blood during a blood drive. You may also get medicines like low-dose aspirin, hydroxyurea, or interferon alfa to thin your blood and stop your body from making too many blood cells."
1,Can you live with polycythemia vera?,"Many people with polycythemia vera ( PV) live a normal life with this rare blood cancer under control. The goal is to avoid complications like blood clots, which may happen because PV thickens your blood. To prevent those problems, your doctor will recommend treatments to improve your blood flow and help you feel better."
1,How do I know if I have a blood clot if I have polycythemia vera?,"Watch for signs of a clot, such as: Chest pain Shortness of breath Dizziness Pain and swelling in your leg Call your doctor or go to an emergency room right away if you have these signs."
1,If I have polycythemia vera will I get blood clots?,These problems don't happen to everyone who has polycythemia vera. They're more likely if you're older than 60 or have already had a blood clot or complication. You'll want to work with your doctor to get a sense of your risk and how to lower it.
1,What is gout and how does polycythemia vera cause it?,Gout is a type of arthritis. It's caused by the buildup of uric acid in your joints. Uric acid forms into hard crystals that leave the joints sore and swollen. You get gout when cells turn over too quickly in your body -- like in PV.
1,How can I prevent itchiness with polycythemia vera?,To prevent itchiness: Keep the water cool when you shower or take a bath. Gently pat your skin dry when you get out of the water. Don't rub it dry. Use moisturizer every day. Your doctor may recommend an antihistamine or low-dose aspirin.
1,What are the symptoms of an enlarged spleen because of polycythemia vera?,"Doctors call this âsplenomegaly.â If your spleen is enlarged, you may have symptoms like: A feeling of fullness Swelling in your belly Weight loss Stomach pain If your enlarged spleen causes problems, you may need to take medicine for it, or you may need surgery to remove it."
1,How does polycythemia vera cause myelofibrosis and leukemia?,"After years of pumping out extra red blood cells, your bone marrow can become so filled with scar tissue that it can't make enough blood cells to meet your body's needs. Doctors call this condition myelofibrosis. It's rare, but abnormal bone marrow cells grow out of control. This can lead to acute myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Again, these problems aren't likely. Your doctor will closely follow your health to make sure you're doing well and staying free of complications."
1,Why are blood clots bad?,"Sometimes a clot gets loose and travels through a blood vessel. From there, it can move into your lung and get stuck. This is a pulmonary embolism, and it's an emergency. A clot can also lodge in the brain and cause a stroke. Or it can block a blood vessel in the heart and cause a heart attack. A blood clot can also form in the main blood vessel that leads to the liver. You get gout when cells turn over too quickly in your body -- like in PV."
2,Are sterols and stanols good for heart health?,"Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements. They reduce the amount of cholesterol that your body absorbs from food. They're also added to many foods, such as some margarines, orange juice, and yogurts. Experts recommend 2 grams a day to help lower LDL cholesterol for people who have high cholesterol."
3,What is a coronary calcium scan?,"This CT scan of your chest can help doctors spot calcium buildup in the arteries around your heart, a sign that they have too much plaque."
3,What is a carotid ultrasound?,"Two of the major blood vessels in your neck are your carotid arteries. When they have thick, fatty deposits of cholesterol inside, it's a sign you're at higher risk for a heart attack or stroke. Your doctor might do an ultrasound scan of your neck called a carotid intima-media thickness test to check them out."
3,Why would my doctor check my thyroid gland while I am taking statins?,"If it's not making enough hormones, a condition called hypothyroidism, it may cause muscle pain when you take statins."
3,What is an ankle brachial index test?,Two of the major blood vessels in your neck are your carotid arteries. High blood pressure is a major sign of heart disease risk. This test measures the blood pressure in your legs. It helps your doctor compare your blood pressure in both your legs and your arms. Your total score is the division of your ankle blood pressure reading by your arm blood pressure reading.
3,Do statins always work to lower cholesterol?,"They also can help protect you from heart attacks and strokes. But for some people who take them, they don't work well enough. If your statin doesn't help, don't worry. Your doctor can help you find other treatments. If you have it, statins may not be able to lower your levels enough."
4,What are the possible risks of taking part in a clinical trial for arthritis treatment?,"Potential side effects from participating in a clinical trial will depend on the type of treatment and the patient's condition. All of the risks and side effects of the treatment being researched are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. Since this is the case, there may be unknown side effects, as well as hoped-for benefits."
4,What are different phases of clinical trials for arthritis?,"In a phase I clinical trial, the new arthritis treatment being investigated is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely. Phase II clinical trials determine the effect of the research treatment on patients and usually the best dosage. In Phase III clinical trials, the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use."
4,What questions are researchers trying to answer during a clinical trial for a new arthritis treatment?,"When a new arthritis treatment is studied for the first time in humans, it is not known exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to the following questions: Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work?"
4,What is informed consent in relation to clinical trials for arthritis?,"Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. Ask the doctor or nurse to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments. After you agree to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial."
4,What happens during a clinical trial for arthritis treatment?,"A clinical trial is a research study conducted with patients to evaluate a new arthritis treatment, drug, or device. The new treatments are considered to be at least as effective or possibly more effective than the standard. Only the treatments most likely to work are further evaluated in a small group of humans prior to applying them in a larger clinical trial."
4,What questions should you ask when you take a part in a clinical trial for arthritis?,"How well does the treatment work? Here are some important questions to ask: What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests given? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? Are there standard treatment options for my arthritis, and how does the study treatment compare with them? How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? ( Note: There can also be side effects from standard arthritis treatments and from the disease itself.) How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require extra time on my part? Will I have to be hospitalized? If so, how often and for how long? If I agree to withdraw from the clinical trial, will my care be affected? Will I need to change doctors?"
5,Why should I choose a reliable brand of probiotic?,"Some companies have been around for years, and you may know their names. Those that have made probiotics for a while may be more likely to have tested and studied them over and over. It's smarter to choose a product from a reputable maker. Check a third-party certifier (like Consumer Lab or the USP) to see if they have tested the product and found that it's safe and reliable. If you're in doubt, ask your doctor."
5,How do I know what probiotic is right for me?,"Each has its own benefits, so talk to your doctor about which one might help you the most. For example, different strains of lactobacillus bacteria, found in some yogurts, can help with some types of diarrhea."
5,What are ways I could add probiotics to my diet?,"You can buy them as tablets, capsules, powders, or liquids. Look for them in health food stores, grocery stores, drugstores, and online. You can also find probiotics in many foods. Yogurt is the most well-known source, but they're also in: Dairy foods like buttermilk, some soft cheeses, fermented milk, and kefir Soy drinks and products like miso and tempeh Kimchi, sauerkraut, and many pickles Many types of bacteria are probiotics. If you go with a supplement, know that the FDA regulates these products but treats them like foods and not medications. If you're in doubt, ask your doctor."
5,How do I take a probiotic?,"Here are some things you should be able to find on the label: The genus, species, and strain of the probiotic ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, for example) The number of organisms that will be alive by the use-by date The dose The company name and contact information If you can't find this on the label, you may be able to find it on the company's website. If you're in doubt, ask your doctor. Probiotic-rich foods, like yogurt, can become a part of a healthy diet, too."
5,Why is it important to read the label of probiotics?,"If you choose yogurt or another dairy food, look on the label for the phrase ""contains live active cultures"" or ""contains probiotics."" Not all yogurts have them. If you go with a supplement, know that the FDA regulates these products but treats them like foods and not medications. Unlike drug manufacturers, supplement makers don't have to show their products are safe or effective to sell them. That's why it's key to get as much info as you can before you buy. Here are some things you should be able to find on the label: The genus, species, and strain of the probiotic ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, for example) The number of organisms that will be alive by the use-by date The dose The company name and contact information If you can't find this on the label, you may be able to find it on the company's website."
6,How is anti-thyroid medication used for hyperthyroidism?,"After you start using anti-thyroid medications, your symptoms should begin to disappear in about 6-8 weeks. But you'll typically need to keep taking the medication for about a year. At that time, your doctor will check to see if you can stop. You'll need regular checkups once you're off the medicine to make sure your hormone levels stay balanced."
6,When do you need surgery to treat hyperthyroidism?,Doctors don't usually do surgery unless you're pregnant (and can't take anti-thyroid medicine) or have a large goiter or cancerous nodule.
6,How is radioactive iodide treatment used for hyperthyroidism?,"Thyroid hormone production can be slowed or stopped completely with: Radioactive iodide treatment Anti-thyroid medication Surgery If your doctor decides that radioactive treatment is best, you'll swallow a tablet or liquid with enough radioactive iodide to damage the cells of your thyroid gland so they can't make hormones. Sometimes you'll need more than one treatment to cut back hormone production to a normal level."
6,Which products should you avoid if you have thyroid problems?,"Avoid these products: Pseudoephedrine (found in over-the-counter cold remedies) can cause nervousness, insomnia, headache, and high blood pressure. Alkaloids, including caffeine, morphine, and quinine, can raise your blood pressure and heart rate."
6,What are alternative medicines for thyroid problems?,"Some people try other therapies to cleanse the body, restore immune function, and balance the production and release of hormones. While they may help with the stress associated with thyroid disease, there are no good studies showing that these therapies are effective for treating thyroid disorders."
7,How can you tweak your settings to treat computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"You don't have to live with the factory-installed presets if you're uncomfortable. Adjust the brightness, contrast, and font size until you find what's best for you. Visit your eye doctor regularly for exams and to keep your prescriptions up to date. Let him know about any problems you have. You may need glasses or contact lenses. He'll decide if you can wear your regular glasses for computer work or if you need a special pair. He might prescribe a single or bifocal lens, or tinted lens material to boost contrast and filter out glare. Get your kids' eyes checked, too. Make sure any computers they use are set up at the right height and in the best light."
7,How can you cut the glare to treat computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"You can also add a glare filter to your monitor. Rearrange your desk. The best position for your monitor is slightly below eye level, about 20 to 28 inches away from your face. You shouldn't have to stretch your neck or strain your eyes to see what's on the screen."
7,What are the symptoms of computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"There's no proof that computer use causes any long-term damage to the eyes. But regular use can lead to eye strain and discomfort. You may notice: Blurred vision Double vision Dry, red eyes Eye irritation Headaches Neck or back pain If you don't do anything about them, it could affect more than your eyes. You could also have issues with your work performance."
7,Who can be affected by computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"Working adults aren't the only ones affected. Kids who stare at tablets or use computers during the day at school can have issues, too, especially if the lighting and their posture are less than ideal."
7,How do you know if you have computer vision syndrome?,"You may notice: Blurred vision Double vision Dry, red eyes Eye irritation Headaches Neck or back pain If you don't do anything about them, it could affect more than your eyes. You could also have issues with your work performance."
7,How can you give your eyes a break to treat computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"Follow the 20-20-20 rule. Look away from the screen every 20 minutes or so and look at something around 20 feet away for about 20 seconds. Blink often to keep your eyes moist. If they feel dry, try some eye drops."
7,How does using a computer affect vision?,"When you work at a computer, your eyes have to focus and refocus all the time. They move back and forth as you read. You may have to look down at papers and then back up to type. Your eyes react to images constantly moving and changing, shifting focus, sending rapidly varying images to the brain. All these jobs require a lot of effort from your eye muscles."
7,How often should I visit my eye doctor for computer vision syndrome?,"Visit your eye doctor regularly for exams and to keep your prescriptions up to date. Let him know about any problems you have. You may need glasses or contact lenses. He'll decide if you can wear your regular glasses for computer work or if you need a special pair. He might prescribe a single or bifocal lens, or tinted lens material to boost contrast and filter out glare. Get your kids' eyes checked, too. Make sure any computers they use are set up at the right height and in the best light."
7,Who Is more likely to have problems of computer vision syndrome?,"You're more likely to have problems if you already have eye trouble, if you need glasses but don't have them, or if you wear the wrong prescription for computer use. Computer work gets harder as you age and the natural lenses in your eyes becomes less flexible. Somewhere around age 40, your ability to focus on near and far objects will start to go away. Your eye doctor will call this condition presbyopia."
7,Who is affected by computer vision syndrome?,"Working adults aren't the only ones affected. Kids who stare at tablets or use computers during the day at school can have issues, too, especially if the lighting and their posture are less than ideal."
7,What is computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"That can put a real strain on your eyes. Eye problems caused by computer use fall under the heading computer vision syndrome ( CVS). It isn't one specific problem. Instead, it includes a whole range of eye strain and discomfort. Research shows that between 50% and 90% of people who work at a computer screen have at least some symptoms. All these jobs require a lot of effort from your eye muscles."
7,How can you rearrange your desk to treat computer vision syndrome (CVS)?,"You shouldn't have to stretch your neck or strain your eyes to see what's on the screen. Put a stand next to your monitor and place any printed materials you're working from on it. That way, you won't have to look up at the screen and back down at the desk while you type. Look away from the screen every 20 minutes or so and look at something around 20 feet away for about 20 seconds."

8,How do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause high blood pressure problems?,"NSAIDs -- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- include both prescription and over-the-counter varieties. They are often used to relieve pain or reduce inflammation from conditions such as arthritis. However, NSAIDs can make the body retain fluid and decrease kidney function. This may cause blood pressure to rise even higher, putting greater stress on your heart and kidneys."
8,How do migraine headache drugs worsen high blood pressure?,"Some migraine headache drugs work by tightening blood vessels in your head. This relieves migraine pain. However, the medication also constricts blood vessels throughout your body. This can make blood pressure rise, perhaps to dangerous levels. If you have high blood pressure or any other type of heart disease, talk with your doctor before taking medication for migraines or severe headaches."
8,How do cough and cold medications worsen high blood pressure?,"Many cough and cold medications contain NSAIDs to relieve pain. Decongestants can make blood pressure worse in two ways: Decongestants may make your blood pressure and heart rate rise. Avoid using cough and cold medicine that contains NSAIDs or decongestants. Ask your doctor for suggestions about other ways to ease symptoms of cold, flu, or sinus problems."
8,What are tips to avoid blood pressure problems from medication?,"If you have high blood pressure to begin with, it can rise to dangerous levels. NSAIDs -- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- include both prescription and over-the-counter varieties. Read medication labels before buying over-the-counter preparations. Make sure the medicine doesn't contain ingredients that could make your high blood pressure worse, such as NSAIDs or decongestants. Talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medication, herbal preparation, vitamins, or other nutritional supplements. Ask for alternatives to potentially harmful medicines."
8,How do weight loss drugs worsen high blood pressure?,"Some drugs can make blood pressure rise. Decongestants can make blood pressure worse in two ways: Decongestants may make your blood pressure and heart rate rise. When the blood pressure rises, it can put more stress on your heart. Before using any weight loss drug, whether prescription or over-the-counter, be sure to check with your doctor. These medications may do you more harm than good."
9,When should someone seek medical attention for peritonitis?,"If you have any symptoms of peritonitis, call your doctor right away. Seeking prompt medical attention is especially important for peritoneal dialysis patients who have a combination of abdominal pain and a clouding of the peritoneal fluid, which is caused by a buildup of infection-fighting white blood cells. Because peritonitis can rapidly lead to potentially fatal complications such as sepsis and septic shock, which causes a massive drop in blood pressure, organ failure, and death, it's essential to receive a quick diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment."
9,What should you know about peritonitis?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum, the tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers and supports most of your abdominal organs. Peritonitis is usually caused by infection from bacteria or fungi. Left untreated, peritonitis can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) and to other organs, resulting in multiple organ failure and death. So if you develop any of the symptoms of peritonitis -- the most common of which is severe abdominal pain -- it's essential to seek prompt medical evaluation and treatment that can prevent potentially fatal complications."
9,What are common causes of secondary peritonitis?,"Common causes of secondary peritonitis include: A ruptured appendix, diverticulum, or stomach ulcer Digestive diseases such as Crohn's disease and diverticulitis Pancreatitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Perforations of the stomach, intestine, gallbladder, or appendix Surgery Trauma to the abdomen, such as an injury from a knife or gunshot wound Noninfectious causes of peritonitis include irritants such as bile, blood, or foreign substances in the abdomen, such as barium."
9,What are the two main types of peritonitis?,"Other signs and symptoms related to peritonitis may include: Abdominal tenderness or distention Chills Fever Fluid in the abdomen Not passing any urine, or passing significantly less urine than usual Difficulty passing gas or having a bowel movement Vomiting The two main types of peritonitis are primary spontaneous peritonitis, an infection that develops in the peritoneum; and secondary peritonitis, which usually develops when an injury or infection in the abdominal cavity allows infectious organisms into the peritoneum. Both types of peritonitis are life-threatening. The death rate from peritonitis depends on many factors, but can be as high as 40% in those who also have cirrhosis. As many as 10% may die from secondary peritonitis."
9,How can I lower my risk of peritonitis?,Wear a mouth/nose mask during exchanges. Observe the proper sterile exchange technique. Apply an antibiotic cream to the catheter exit site every day. Immediately report any possible contamination of your dialysis fluid or catheter to your peritoneal dialysis nurse.
9,What is the treatment for peritonitis?,"Typically, you'll immediately start receiving intravenous antibiotics or antifungal medications to treat the infection. Additional supportive treatments will be necessary if organ failure from sepsis develops as a complication of the infection. Such treatments may include intravenous fluids, drugs to maintain blood pressure, and nutritional support."
9,What are the symptoms of peritonitis?,"The first symptoms of peritonitis are typically poor appetite and nausea and a dull abdominal ache that quickly turns into persistent, severe abdominal pain, which is worsened by any movement. Other signs and symptoms related to peritonitis may include: Abdominal tenderness or distention Chills Fever Fluid in the abdomen Not passing any urine, or passing significantly less urine than usual Difficulty passing gas or having a bowel movement Vomiting The two main types of peritonitis are primary spontaneous peritonitis, an infection that develops in the peritoneum; and secondary peritonitis, which usually develops when an injury or infection in the abdominal cavity allows infectious organisms into the peritoneum."
9,When is emergency surgery required to treat peritonitis?,"Because peritonitis can rapidly lead to potentially fatal complications such as sepsis and septic shock, which causes a massive drop in blood pressure, organ failure, and death, it's essential to receive a quick diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment. In many cases, emergency surgery is required, especially if peritonitis has been caused by conditions such as appendicitis, a perforated stomach ulcer, or diverticulitis. Infected tissue such as a burst appendix or abscess will be surgically removed."
9,What is the treatment for peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis?,"Typically, you'll immediately start receiving intravenous antibiotics or antifungal medications to treat the infection. Until the peritonitis is cured, you will need to use another method of dialysis, such as hemodialysis."
9,How will my doctor diagnose peritonitis?,"Diagnostic tests for peritonitis may include: Blood and urine tests Imaging studies such as X-rays and computerized tomography ( CT) scans Exploratory surgery Your doctor also may perform a paracentesis, a procedure in which fluid from the abdominal cavity is withdrawn through a thin needle and checked for infection. Paracentesis is useful for identifying primary spontaneous peritonitis and secondary peritonitis caused by pancreatitis. If you're receiving peritoneal dialysis, you can lower your risk of peritonitis by following these tips: Thoroughly wash your hands, including the areas between your fingers and under your fingernails, before touching the catheter."
10,What are some harmful toxins associated with vaping?,"It's hard to know how much of these chemicals you breathe in when you vape. The levels are usually lower in e-cigarettes than regular cigarettes. But some studies show that high-voltage e-cigarettes have more formaldehyde and other toxins than standard e-cigarettes. Also, some chemicals in e-cigarettes can irritate the airways in your lungs. This can cause problems. Studies have found that flavorings like cinnamon can cause inflammation of lung cells. But more research is needed to understand the long-term health risks of vaping."
11,How can losing extra weight prevent you from getting prediabetes?,"If you're overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains."
11,How can I make exercise a habit if I have prediabetes?,"Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you're not moving."
11,What should I do to lose weight if I have prediabetes?,"If you're overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains."
11,What should I do if I smoke and have prediabetes?,"Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don't. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better."
11,How can you stop prediabetes in its tracks?,"Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. Start by making these three changes. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week."
12,How common is osteoporosis overall?,"In the U. S., more than 10 million men and women have osteoporosis. And nearly another 34 million are thought to have low bone mass. That places them at increased risk for osteoporosis."
12,How many people will break a bone due to osteoporosis?,"About half of all women over age 50 and about one in four men will break a bone due to osteoporosis. But there are many things you can do to prevent osteoporosis and avoid painful fractures. For instance, make sure you get plenty of calcium in your daily diet. You can get calcium from both foods and supplements. You can also check your osteoporosis risk factors and change those you can control. For example, stop smoking if you are a smoker. If you need them, your health care provider can make recommendations about using osteoporosis medications."
12,How can estrogen contribute to the development of osteoporosis?,"For instance, a decrease in estrogen at menopause is one cause. This can happen with natural menopause or an early surgical menopause if you have your ovaries removed. During the first five to 10 years after menopause, women can lose about 2.5% of bone density each year. That means they can lose as much as 25% of their bone density during that time. Accelerated bone loss after menopause is a major cause of osteoporosis in women."
12,How can menopause increase your risk for osteoporosis?,"Then, for several years, the breakdown of bone occurs at a much greater pace than the building of new bone. This is the process that eventually causes osteoporosis. During this time, even though your bones may still be strong enough to prevent unusual fractures and you have no signs to alert you to the disease, bone loss may become detectable with a bone density test. During the first five to 10 years after menopause, women can lose about 2.5% of bone density each year."
12,What causes osteoporosis?,"For instance, a decrease in estrogen at menopause is one cause. There is also a genetic component. If your mother or grandmother had osteoporosis, the chances are higher that you will develop it, too. Eating a diet that's low in calcium, getting little exercise, and smoking cigarettes can also increase your chances of getting osteoporosis. But there are many things you can do to prevent osteoporosis and avoid painful fractures."
13,How can transcranial magnetic stimulation help prevent migraines?,"There are also several devices which can prevent migraines: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS): During this treatment, you'll hold a small device called Spring TMS to the back of your head. It sends a split-second pulse which interrupts abnormal electrical activity caused by migraine, thus aborts the migraine. Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation ( TSNS): Cefaly uses transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation and is worn as a headband on the forehead and turned on daily for 20 minutes to prevent migraine from developing. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (n VS): gamma Core is a n VS and works by being placed placed over the vagus nerve in the neck. It releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."
13,How can biofeedback help prevent migraines?,"You can try: Biofeedback: This type of therapy teaches you to be aware of how your body reacts to stress, whether that's tense muscles, a fast heart rate, or cold, clammy hands. A trained professional teaches you how to change that response and calm down. Studies show that people who use biofeedback have 55% fewer migraines. This therapy may work even better when you also take medicine that prevents headaches."
13,How can progressive muscle relaxation help prevent migraines?,"Progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR): This relaxation technique helps stop your body's response to stress before it triggers a migraine. A therapist will show you to tightly contract, then fully release, each of your muscles. He'll also teach you to deepen and slow your breathing."
13,How can tonabersat help prevent migraines?,They affect the release of certain brain chemicals and block pain pathways in your brain.
13,How can cognitive behavioral therapy help to prevent migraines?,She'll also teach you to change the way your body reacts to the pain you feel during an attack.
13,How do triggers of migraines vary?,"Every person with migraine has different symptoms. Everyone's triggers are different too, although some common ones include lack of sleep, certain foods, and stress. As doctors learn more about migraine and what parts of the brain are involved, they're finding better ways to prevent these headaches."
13,What are some alternative therapies to prevent migraines?,"Clinical trials are under way to test drugs that block prostaglandins in people. After all, stress is the most common trigger. Studies show that people who learn to better deal with their worries actually start to have fewer migraines. Progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR): This relaxation technique helps stop your body's response to stress before it triggers a migraine."
13,What are some treatments that could prevent migraines?,"When blood vessels in your brain get inflamed and swollen, it sets many other changes in motion. If you have frequent attacks, your doctor may prescribe a drug to reduce the number of migraines you have. Drugs used to prevent migraines include: Antidepressants: amitriptyline and venlafaxine ( Effexor) Anti-seizure drugs: gabapentin ( Neurontin), topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax, Trokendi XR) and valproate ( Depakote) Beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol CGRP Inhibitors: erenumab ( Aimovig), fremanezumab ( Ajovy), and galcanezumab-gnlm ( Emgality) Although they can offer help, some of these medications were made to treat other health problems. There are also several devices which can prevent migraines: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS): During this treatment, you'll hold a small device called Spring TMS to the back of your head. It sends a split-second pulse which interrupts abnormal electrical activity caused by migraine, thus aborts the migraine. Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation ( TSNS): Cefaly uses transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation and is worn as a headband on the forehead and turned on daily for 20 minutes to prevent migraine from developing. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (n VS): gamma Core is a n VS and works by being placed placed over the vagus nerve in the neck. It releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."
14,Can cold packs ease itching due to psoriasis?,Chill out. Cold packs can take the itch out by short-circuiting the itch-scratch cycle. They âconfuseâ your brain because it's hard for it to feel itch and cold at the same time.
14,How can softening scales help you ease psoriasis pain?,"Lotions with salicylic, lactic, or glycolic acids can break up dead skins cells that build up on psoriasis plaques. Slather it on at night and cover the area with plastic wrap. This helps keep the lotion in place so you skin absorbs it better."
14,Can washing with vinegar ease psoriasis itching?,"Apple cider vinegar can help soothe itchy scalp psoriasis. Massage it into your scalp a few times a week. If it burns your head, use a half water-half vinegar mixture. Or rinse your scalp after the vinegar dries to prevent irritation. If it's going to work, you should see results in about 2 weeks. Take a pass if your scalp is cracked or bleeding."
14,How can moistureizers help you ease psoriasis symptoms?,"Your psoriasis may be uncomfortable because your skin is dry, scaly, and inflamed. A moisturizer is your friend. Thicker or greasier is usually better. Pick creams and ointments that come in a tub or tube. Lotions, on the other hand, tend to be watered down. Look for moisturizers with an ingredient called ceramide. Even something as basic as petroleum jelly can help your skin and lock in moisture."
14,Can baths help you ease psoriasis symptoms?,"Soak for about 15 minutes. This soothing brew helps remove scales and eases itch. Oatmeal baths can take the tickle out, too. After your bath, pat your skin dry and put on moisturizer right away. In China and elsewhere in Asia, it's widely used for psoriasis."
14,How can heat help you ease psoriasis pain?,"Lotions with salicylic, lactic, or glycolic acids can break up dead skins cells that build up on psoriasis plaques. The ingredient that makes chili peppers hot can ease pain. Ask your pharmacist for lotions and creams with pramoxine or menthol. That only makes it worse and can injure you skin, which makes it hurt even more. One recent study found that acupuncture therapies were simple, effective, and had few side effects."
14,Can acupuncture ease psoriasis symptoms?,"Having some remedies on hand can soothe your sore skin when you need it the most. It's often used to treat pain. Some studies show acupuncture doesn't make a meaningful difference, while others find it helps. One recent study found that acupuncture therapies were simple, effective, and had few side effects. Run it by your doctor before you get acupuncture. So try to find ways to relax if you have it."
14,Why should you call your doctor about psoriasis pain?,"That's a sign of an infection. It can spread and become much worse than a regular flare. You may need an antibiotic. Call her if your psoriasis gets worse, you're depressed, your skin is red all over, or your joints hurt."
15,How can you be smart with antibiotics?,The best way to help slow the spread of super bacteria is by being smart with antibiotics. Here's how: Trust your doctor if she says you don't need them. Don't take them for a viral infection. Only take the ones your doctor has prescribed for you. Take them as directed. Don't skip doses. Take them for the full number of days your doctor prescribes. Don't save them for later.
15,What types of infections can be treated with antibiotics?,The word antibiotic means âagainst life.â Any drug that kills germs in your body is technically an antibiotic. These are the types of infections that can be treated with antibiotics: Some ear and sinus infections Dental infections Skin infections Meningitis (swelling of the brain and spinal cord) Strep throat Bladder and kidney infections Bacterial pneumonias Whooping cough Only bacterial infections can be killed with antibiotics.
16,What happens during an evoked potential test?,"When you have the tests, you'll have wires placed on your scalp. It's safe and painless. It usually takes about 2 hours to do all three types of evoked potential tests. A doctor with special training in these tests will interpret the results."
16,How do evoked potential tests help treat multiple sclerosis?,"If you have multiple sclerosis ( MS), the disease causes damage to your nerves that may slow down, garble, or stop this activity entirely. Evoked potential tests can help doctors see if this is happening to you. The tests measure the electrical activity in parts of the brain caused by light, sound, and touch."
16,What should you know about multiple sclerosis and evoked potential tests?,"If you have multiple sclerosis ( MS), the disease causes damage to your nerves that may slow down, garble, or stop this activity entirely. Evoked potential tests can help doctors see if this is happening to you. The tests measure the electrical activity in parts of the brain caused by light, sound, and touch. They can help doctors diagnose someone with MS because they can detect problems along some nerves that are too subtle to find through other exams."
16,What are the three main types of evoked potential tests?,"There are three main types of evoked potential tests: Visual evoked potentials ( VEP): You sit in front of a screen and watch an alternating checkerboard pattern. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEP): You hear a series of clicks in each ear. Sensory evoked potentials ( SEP): You get short electrical pulses on one of your arms or legs. A fourth type of test, motor evoked potentials, can find damage along nerves in the brain and spinal cord that make your body move. But doctors don't usually use this type to diagnose MS."
16,What are the different types of evoked potential tests for multiple sclerosis?,"There are three main types of evoked potential tests: Visual evoked potentials ( VEP): You sit in front of a screen and watch an alternating checkerboard pattern. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEP): You hear a series of clicks in each ear. Sensory evoked potentials ( SEP): You get short electrical pulses on one of your arms or legs.

It usually takes about 2 hours to do all three types of evoked potential tests. A doctor with special training in these tests will interpret the results. While evoked potentials can help diagnose MS, they can't let your doctor know for sure whether the condition is causing problems with the signals in your nerves or if they're happening because of another health problem. Your doctor will consider the results of these tests along with those of other lab tests and your symptoms before he makes a diagnosis."
16,What will the results of an evoked potential test tell my doctor?,They can help doctors diagnose someone with MS because they can detect problems along some nerves that are too subtle to find through other exams. A doctor with special training in these tests will interpret the results.
17,What are the effects of too much magnesium from supplements?,Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics.
17,How is riboflavin related to migraine?,"Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches."
17,Is riboflavin safe?,"Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color."
17,What is feverfew and what does it treat?,"This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation."
17,What are the side effects of riboflavin for migraines?,"Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color."
17,What is the relationship between chronic migraines and melatonin levels?,Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective.
17,Is riboflavin found in daily vitamin pills?,"It's found naturally in foods like: Meat Eggs Milk Green veggies Nuts Enriched flour And like many of the other B vitamins, it's also found in daily vitamin pills."
17,How much feverfew should I take to treat migraines?,"If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results."
17,Can feverfew treat migraines?,Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines.
17,How is magnesium levels related to migraines?,"It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly."
17,Should I discuss natural treatments for migraines with my doctor?,"Remember, âall naturalâ doesn't necessarily mean safe. Any supplement you take should be discussed with your doctor."
17,Are there any side effects from coenzyme Q10?,"Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective."
17,How can melatonin help with migraines?,"Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective."

If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them."
17,How can coenzyme Q10 help with migraines?,"Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective."
18,What  tests are done to help you know when to consider knee replacement surgery?,"X-rays are a key tool. They'll give your surgeon a better idea of whether your bone is damaged or deformed. An imaging test called an MRI will give a more detailed look into the bone and soft tissues around your knee. You also may get a blood test to rule out, or point to, other causes for your knee pain. If your doctor decides a total knee replacement is the way to go, you can learn about how much it might help, possible complications, and what to expect after surgery. If you are obese, most surgeons will insist you lose some weight."
18,What do you need to know about knee replacement surgery?,"You'll also have a physical exam so your surgeon can check out how your leg lines up and how much motion, strength, and stability you have in your knee. X-rays are a key tool. You also may get a blood test to rule out, or point to, other causes for your knee pain. They may talk about other treatment options like arthroscopic surgery, joint preservation procedures, or a partial knee replacement."
19,How is cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis) diagnosed?,"The doctor will generally begin by asking you about symptoms and taking a medical history. This will be followed by a physical exam of the body, with a focus on the neck, back, and shoulders. The doctor is also likely to test reflexes and the strength of hands and arms, check for loss of sensation, and watch you walk. Other tests that might be done include imaging exams such as X-rays, computed tomography ( CT), and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). MRI scans use large magnets, radio waves, and a computer to produce the best images of the body. You might also be referred to a neurologist."
19,What are the symptoms of cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis) with myelopathy?,"If cervical spondylosis results in pressure on the spinal cord (cervical stenosis), it can put pressure on the spinal cord, a condition called cervical myelopathy. Symptoms of cervical spondylosis with myelopathy include: Tingling, numbness, and/or weakness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet Lack of coordination and difficulty walking Abnormal reflexes Muscle spasms Loss of control over bladder and bowel (incontinence) Another possible complication of cervical spondylosis is cervical radiculopathy, when bone spurs press on nerves as they exit the bones of the spinal column."
19,What is cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis)?,"It is a condition involving changes to the bones, discs, and joints of the neck. These changes are caused by the normal wear-and-tear of aging. With age, the discs of the cervical spine gradually break down, lose fluid, and become stiffer. Cervical spondylosis usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly people."
19,What causes cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis)?,"With age, the discs of the cervical spine gradually break down, lose fluid, and become stiffer. As a result of the degeneration of discs and other cartilage, spurs or abnormal growths called osteophytes may form on the bones in the neck. These abnormal growths can cause narrowing of the interior of the spinal column or in the openings where spinal nerves exit, a related condition called cervical spinal stenosis. Cervical spondylosis most often causes neck pain and stiffness. But surgery is considered only when there is a severe loss of function."
19,When is surgery needed for cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis)?,"Cervical spondylosis is also called cervical osteoarthritis. The doctor is also likely to test reflexes and the strength of hands and arms, check for loss of sensation, and watch you walk. But in most cases, it is not progressive. Surgery is required only in rare cases. The goal of surgery is to remove the source of pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. The surgery may also include adding stabilization in the form of implants or through fusion of the vertebrae."
19,What are the risk factors of cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis)?,"Cervical spondylosis is also called cervical osteoarthritis. In most people older than age 50, the discs between the vertebrae become less spongy and provide less of a cushion. Bones and ligaments get thicker, encroaching on the space of the spinal canal. People in certain occupations or who perform specific activities -- such as gymnasts or other athletes -- may put more stress on their necks. You might also be referred to a neurologist."
19,What are the symptoms of cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis)?,"With age, the discs of the cervical spine gradually break down, lose fluid, and become stiffer. The symptoms of cervical spondylosis include: Neck stiffness and pain Headache that may originate in the neck Pain in the shoulder or arms Inability to fully turn the head or bend the neck, sometimes interfering with driving Grinding noise or sensation when the neck is turned Symptoms of cervical spondylosis tend to improve with rest."
19,What are the treatments for cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis)?,"With age, the discs of the cervical spine gradually break down, lose fluid, and become stiffer. In most cases, cervical spondylosis treatments are conservative. They include: Rest Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) or other non-narcotic products to relieve pain from inflammation Chiropractic manipulation that can help to control episodes of more severe pain Wearing a cervical collar to limit movement and provide support Other forms of physical therapy, including the application of heat and cold therapy, traction, or exercise Injecting drugs (corticosteroids and a local anesthetic) into the joints of the spine or the area surrounding the spine, known as epidural steroid injection or cervical facet joint injection Cervical spondylosis tends to be a chronic (long-term) condition."
20,How can I reduce the side effects of stimulant therapy for ADHD?,"Clonidine and guanfacine can help reduce some of the side effects of stimulant therapy, especially sleeplessness and aggressive behavior. However, combining stimulants with one of these drugs is controversial, because there have been some deaths in children taking both stimulants and Catapres (a patch form of clonidine). It is not known whether these deaths were due to the combination of drugs, but caution should be exercised whenever such combinations are used."
20,What are the advantages of non-stimulant drugs over stimulant medications for ADHD?,"Nonstimulants don't tend to cause agitation, sleeplessness, or lack of appetite. They also don't pose the same risk of abuse or addiction. Plus, they have a longer-lasting and smoother effect than many stimulants, which can take effect and wear off abruptly."
20,What ADHD-specific nonstimulants are used for treating ADHD?,"Atomoxetine ( Strattera) is OK for children, teens, and adults. It seems to boost the amount of an important brain chemical called norepinephrine. This appears to increase a person's attention span and lessen their impulsive behavior and hyperactivity. Clonidine ER ( Kapvay) and Guanfacine ER ( Intuniv) are approved for children ages 6 to 17. Doctors also prescribe them to adults. These two drugs have an effect on certain areas in the brain. Studies show they lower distractibility and improve attention, working memory, and impulse control."

Call your doctor with any problems or questions. Antidepressants usually take at least 2 to 4 weeks before you start to notice if they're working. Be patient, and don't give up before giving them a chance to work. Your doctor will probably want to start your medication at a low dose and raise it slowly over time until your symptoms are under control. It's best not to miss doses. You take most once or twice a day. If you miss a day or two of venlafaxine ( Effexor), it can cause an unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Tell your doctor if you notice any new or unusual side effects."
20,How do monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors work to treat ADHD?,But they're rarely used because they sometimes have dangerous side effects and can cause serious problems when you take them with foods and other medications. They may help people if no other medications have worked. Examples include phenelzine ( Nardil) or tranylcypromine ( Parnate).
20,Who should not take antidepressants for ADHD?,"Don't take them if you: Have a history or a tendency toward manic behavior or manic depression (bipolar disorder).

20,What are the side effects of atomoxetine (Strattera) for the treatment of ADHD?,"Atomoxetine might cause: Upset stomach Less appetite, which may cause weight loss Nausea Dizziness Fatigue Mood swings Other less-common risks include: Jaundice and liver problems. Call your doctor right away if you get yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. Suicidal thinking. There's a possibility that atomoxetine, like many antidepressant drugs, may slightly raise the risk of these thoughts in kids, teenagers, and young adults. Erections that last more than 4 hours. Serious allergic reactions. Some people get rashes, hives, or swelling, although this is rare."
20,How does venlafaxine (Effexor and Effexor XR) work to treat ADHD?,"Venlafaxine ( Effexor and Effexor XR) is a newer antidepressant that boosts the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. It helps improve mood and concentration. It's not often used to treat ADHD, though."

The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, sometimes with stomach pain and diarrhea. Long-term use of azathioprine is associated with an increased risk of cancer."
27,Do liver problems occur as a result of rheumatoid arthritis?,These are less common than stomach upset. Your doctor will check blood tests on a regular basis to make sure your liver is not being harmed.
27,What biologic drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologic drugs: abatacept ( Orencia), adalimumab ( Humira), anakinra ( Kineret), certolizumab ( Cimzia), etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Ereizi), golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria), and infliximab ( Remicade). These are the newest drugs for RA and are either injected under the skin or given directly into a vein. They work by neutralizing one of the immune system's signals ( TNF) that lead to inflammation and joint damage. Rituximab ( Rituxan) and tocilizumab ( Actemra) are biologics, but do not block TNF. Rituxan target B cells and actemra affects IL-6."
27,What is azathioprine and how does it treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Azathioprine ( Imuran) is used for many different inflammatory conditions, including RA.

It can take several months to start working and up to a year before the full effects are known. When taken for long periods, minocycline can cause discoloration of the skin."
27,What is leflunomide and how does it treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Since Arava is known to cause harm to a fetus, women must take special precautions to prevent pregnancy. This is because it has been shown to work as well or better than any other single medicine. These drugs are thought to have fewer side effects than other DMARDs. DMARDs sometimes cause nausea, sometimes with vomiting, or diarrhea."
28,Do people with multiple sclerosis have tremors?,"Many people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) have some form of tremor they can't control, in different parts of their bodies, like their head, arms, or legs."
28,"I have multiple sclerosis (MS), what drugs can help with tremors?","These problems are one of the hardest MS symptoms to treat. There aren't any drugs made just to treat MS tremors. Your doctors will probably prescribe drugs for another condition, like: Acetazolamide ( Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Buspirone ( Buspar) and clonazepam ( Klonopin), which are anti-anxiety drugs Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril), an antihistamine Isoniazid ( INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone ( Mysoline), a seizure medicine Propranolol ( Inderal), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement."
28,What causes multiple sclerosis-related tremors?,Tremors result from damage to a part of your brain called the cerebellum.
28,What are psychological ways that multiple sclerosis tremors can affect someone?,"Tremors can be tough to handle in social situations. You may feel like you want to be alone, but that can make you feel lonely and depressed."

28,What are the different types of tremors caused by multiple sclerosis?,"Intention tremor. There's no shaking when you're at rest. It starts when you try to reach or grasp something or move your hand or foot to a precise spot. This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Postural tremors. You shake when you sit or stand, but not when you lie down. This is more common with Parkinson's disease than MS. Nystagmus. This type causes jumpy eye movements."
28,What are medications to treat multiple sclerosis tremors?,"This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Your doctors will probably prescribe drugs for another condition, like: Acetazolamide ( Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Buspirone ( Buspar) and clonazepam ( Klonopin), which are anti-anxiety drugs Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril), an antihistamine Isoniazid ( INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone ( Mysoline), a seizure medicine Propranolol ( Inderal), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement."
29,What are the advantages of LASIK eye surgery?,"LASIK has many benefits, including: It has been around for over 25 years and it works! It corrects vision. Around 96% of patients will have their desired vision after LASIK. An enhancement can further increase this number. LASIK is associated with very little pain due to the numbing drops that are used. Vision is corrected nearly by the day after LASIK. No bandages or stitches are required after LASIK. Adjustments can be made years after LASIK to further correct vision if vision changes while you age. After having LASIK, most patients have a dramatic reduction in eyeglass or contact lens dependence and many patients no longer need them at all."
29,What are the disadvantages of LASIK eye surgery?,"Despite the pluses, there are some disadvantages to LASIK eye surgery: LASIK is technically complex. Rare problems may occur when the doctor creates the flap, which can permanently affect vision. This is one reason to choose a surgeon who is very experienced at performing these surgeries. LASIK can rarely cause a loss of ""best"" vision. Your best vision is the highest degree of vision that you achieved while wearing your contacts or eyeglasses."
29,What is LASIK eye surgery?,"LASIK, which stands for laser in-situ keratomileusis, is a popular surgery used to correct vision in people who are nearsighted, farsighted, or have astigmatism. All laser vision correction surgeries work by reshaping the cornea, the clear front part of the eye, so that light traveling through it is properly focused onto the retina located in the back of the eye."
29,What happens during LASIK eye surgery?,"During LASIK eye surgery, an instrument called a microkeratome or femtosecond laser is used to create a thin flap in the cornea. The cornea flap is then painlessly peeled back and the underlying corneal tissue is reshaped using another laser. After the cornea is reshaped so that it can properly focus light onto the retina, the cornea flap is put back in place and the surgery is complete. LASIK is performed while the patient is under local anesthesia in the form of eye drops (no shots, no needles) and usually takes about 10 minutes to complete."
29,What are the benefits of LASIK eye surgery?,"LASIK has many benefits, including: It has been around for over 25 years and it works! It corrects vision. Around 96% of patients will have their desired vision after LASIK. An enhancement can further increase this number. LASIK is associated with very little pain due to the numbing drops that are used.

Do not wear eye makeup or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you are not feeling well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed."
29,What are the potential side effects of LASIK eye surgery?,"Other side effects, although rare, may include: Glare Seeing halos around images Difficulty driving at night Fluctuating vision Dry eyes Before LASIK eye surgery, you will meet with a coordinator or eye surgeon who will discuss what to expect during and after the procedure. You will revisit the doctor for an evaluation 24 to 48 hours after LASIK eye surgery, as well as at regular intervals within the first six months."
29,Will I be sedated during my LASIK eye surgery?,"During this session, your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be fully examined. Patients may also request mild sedation. Plan to have someone drive you home after surgery."
30,How effective is cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly."
30,When do people have a surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement."
30,How do you know if cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib) is right for you?,"Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day."
30,How is atrial fibrillation (AFib) treated?,"The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes."
30,Can you go home after a cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay a night or longer in the hospital."
30,Which type of ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib) is right for me?,"You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation. The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart."
30,Why is it important to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib) using cardiac ablation?,"The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening."
30,What is catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"This procedure uses energy to make small scars in your heart tissue. Then, it's guided to your heart. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart."
31,Is it hard to tell when someone with heart failure has lost weight?,"A failing heart makes the body to retain water and swell. That can increase your body weight and make you look like you have body fat when you don't. Your doctor can use other tests to figure out if you've lost muscle mass, including measuring how well you do physical activities like walking or how strong your grip is."
31,What causes cardiac cachexia?,Doctors are not exactly sure what causes cardiac cachexia. It involves many different body systems. Some experts think it may happen when there's an imbalance in the way your body's nervous system tells your digestive tract how to break down food.
31,What parts of the body does cardiac cachexia affect?,"The condition also has serious effects on many parts of the body, including the digestive tract, lungs, and heart, and the body's ability to make blood cells."
31,What are some ways cardiac cachexia affects the body and causes symptoms?,"But scientists know a few things about how the condition affects the body and causes symptoms: Fluid buildup from congestive heart failure can sometimes make it harder to absorb nutrients from food. Malnutrition keeps the liver from making a protein called albumin, which helps the blood carry important chemicals throughout your body. The condition makes your body use more energy to do basic things, like breathing. So you burn more calories, but at the same time, you can't absorb them from food. Your body breaks down muscle proteins. That leads to symptoms like fatigue."
31,What are symptoms of cardiac cachexia?,The main symptom of cardiac cachexia is weight loss. You may also feel: Very weak and tired Short of breath Unable to exercise or be active Nauseated Not very hungry Constipation Changes in how food tastes Some of these symptoms make you more likely to lose even more weight.
31,How is cardiac cachexia diagnosed?,"There's no specific test that can diagnose cardiac cachexia. In most cases, doctors will try to rule out other health problems that may be causing your weight loss. If you've lost more than 5% of your body weight in 6 months without trying, your doctor may test your blood to look for substances linked to cardiac cachexia, like the protein albumin."
31,How do you treat cardiac cachexia?,"There's no specific test that can diagnose cardiac cachexia. Your doctor will continue to treat your heart failure and try to improve your symptoms. You may get medicines to get rid of the extra fluid that makes you swell. Other treatments may be: Exercise training to build muscle mass or strengthen existing muscles Teaching you how to eat right for your condition Supplements of important nutrients, like vitamins C and D and folate Medicines to make you feel hungrier"
32,What causes long lasting liver infection?,This long-lasting liver infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus. It begins as an acute hepatitis that starts within the first 6 months of exposure to the virus.
32,Who gets hepatitis C?,"Most people catch the hep C virus when blood from someone who has it gets into their body. This can happen if you share needles to use drugs, or get stuck by one because you work in a hospital or doctor's office. People born to a mother have a 6% risk that they will get it, too."
32,How common is it that someone would get hepatitis C from getting blood products or an organ?,"The CDC recommends you get tested for hepatitis C if: You received blood from a donor who later found out they had hepatitis C You've ever injected drugs You had a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before July 1992 You got a blood product used to treat clotting problems before 1987 You were born between 1945 and 1965 You've had long-term kidney dialysis You have HIV You were born to a mother with hepatitis C Since July 1992, all blood and organ donations in the U. S. are tested for the hepatitis C virus. The CDC says it is now rare that someone getting blood products or an organ would get hepatitis C. You can have the disease and not have symptoms for years."
32,In what ways is someone not able to get hepatitis C?,"You can't get hepatitis C by touching, kissing, coughing, sneezing, sharing utensils, or breastfeeding."
32,What is treatment of hepatitis C dependent upon?,"Until recently, the most common method was a blend of shots and pills. Genotypes 4, 5 and 6 are very rare in the U. S. Treatment now centers around direct acting antiviral drugs ( DAAs). Ask your doctor what's best for you, based on your medical needs."
33,What is the process for creating an Individualized Education Program (IEP)?,"The next step after evaluation is the IEP meeting, which is required by law. The Individualized Education Program is supposed to address all aspects of your child's education. So, a number of different people will need to attend the meeting. At the very least, the meeting should include you, your child's teacher, and a special education teacher. Others who are familiar with different aspects of your child's needs and abilities -- social workers, school psychologists, therapists, or doctors -- also should attend. When appropriate, your child may also participate and offer input at the meeting."
33,Who determines eligibility for an Individualized Education Program (IEP)?,"Professionals within your child's district are usually the ones who do the evaluation, but it can also be done by a developmental pediatrician or psychologist. The evaluation is what determines that your child is eligible for special education. It also helps identify the special services your child might need. If you think your child's evaluation isn't accurate, you can ask for an independent evaluation. That will be done by a professional from outside the school district. Your child's district may pay for that evaluation."
33,How should I prepare for a meeting about my child's Individualized Education Program (IEP)?,"That team will discuss how to best meet your child's educational needs. To prepare for the meeting -- and if your child is able to articulate answers -- you may find it helpful to ask your child questions about school such as: "" What is your favorite subject?"" "" What is the hardest thing for you at school?"" "" What is the easiest thing for you at school?"""
33,How does an Individualized Education Program (IEP) help a child with autism?,"Many children with ASD find it difficult to develop the skills they need. Engaging a child or teen in the IEP process provides an opportunity to teach a child with autism to advocate for himself or herself. For some children, involvement may be limited to attending the IEP meeting. Over time, and depending upon the degree of the disability, some children may be able to take more ownership. When they do, they will more actively participate in designing their IEP for autism. They may be able to identify their own problem areas and help create reasonable goals for themselves."
33,How does the eligibility for Individualized Education Program (IEP) start?,"If the district makes the request, your consent is needed before the evaluation can be done. The evaluation is what determines that your child is eligible for special education. If you think your child's evaluation isn't accurate, you can ask for an independent evaluation. The IEP will be tailored to your child's needs and abilities."
34,How can rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) affect your life?,"People who have the condition sometimes work hard to make everyone like and admire them. Or they might stop trying and stay out of any situation where they might get hurt. This social withdrawal can look like social phobia, which is a serious fear of being embarrassed in public. RSD can affect relationships with family, friends, or a romantic partner. The belief that you're being rejected can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you act differently toward the person you think has rejected you, they may begin to do so for real."
34,What causes rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)?,"People who have the condition sometimes work hard to make everyone like and admire them. When you have ADHD, your nervous system overreacts to things from the outside world. Any sense of rejection can set off your stress response and cause an emotional reaction that's much more extreme than usual. Sometimes the criticism or rejection is imagined, but not always. ADHD researchers estimate that by age 12, children with ADHD get 20,000 more negative messages about themselves than other kids their age. All that criticism can take a real toll on their self-esteem."
34,How is rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) treated?,"This is sometimes called rejection sensitive dysphoria ( RSD). "" If you have ADHD and you've had any of these symptoms, see a psychologist, counselor, or other mental health provider for help. But a therapist can help you learn how to get a handle on your emotions and deal with rejection in a more positive way. Another way to deal with RSD is to manage the stress in your life. You're more likely to have an emotional breakdown when you're stressed out. Eat right, sleep well, and do things like yoga or meditation to keep your mind calm."

35,What are the treatments for specific phobias?,"Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms. For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both."
35,What are natural environment phobias?,"Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water."
36,How can heart failure affect your weight and muscle loss?,"Heart failure can affect muscle and fat metabolism. In the late stages, you might lose a lot of weight and muscle mass. Your muscles can get smaller and weaker."
36,How can heart failure lead to abnormal heart rhythms?,"In a normal heart, the upper chambers (called the atria) and lower chambers (the ventricles) squeeze and relax in turn to move blood through your body. If your ticker is weak, these chambers might not squeeze at the right time. Your heart might beat too slowly, too quickly, or in an irregular pattern. When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body. Atrial fibrillation ( AFib) is one type of abnormal heart rhythm that heart failure can cause. It causes your heart to quiver and skip instead of beating."
36,How can heart failure cause anemia?,"This is a lack of the red blood cells that move oxygen to your body's tissues. If you have anemia, your body may not get enough oxygen. Your kidneys make a protein called erythropoietin ( EPO), which helps your body make new red blood cells. Kidney damage from heart failure prevents your body from making enough EPO."
36,How can heart failure lead to extreme weight and muscle loss?,"Heart failure can affect muscle and fat metabolism. In the late stages, you might lose a lot of weight and muscle mass. Your muscles can get smaller and weaker."
36,How can heart failure lead to kidney damage or failure?,"Your heart has four valves that open and close to keep blood flowing in and out of your heart. Just like your other organs, they need a steady supply of blood to work like they should. Without the amount of blood they need, they won't be able to remove enough wastes from your blood. It's treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. Kidney disease can also make your heart failure worse. Damaged kidneys they can't remove as much water from your blood as healthy ones. You'll start to hold onto fluid, which boosts your blood pressure. High blood pressure makes your heart work even harder. This is called pulmonary edema."
36,How does heart failure affect your lungs?,"When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body. A damaged heart can't pump blood as effectively from your lungs out to your body. This pushes fluid into your air sacs. As liquid builds up, it gets harder to breathe. This is called pulmonary edema."
36,How can heart failure lead to lung problems?,"When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body. A damaged heart can't pump blood as effectively from your lungs out to your body. This pushes fluid into your air sacs. As liquid builds up, it gets harder to breathe. This is called pulmonary edema."
36,How can heart failure lead to liver damage?,"When you have heart failure, your heart may not be strong enough to pump out as much blood as your body needs. It also pumps faster, and your blood vessels narrow to get more blood out to your body. Heart failure can rob your liver of the blood it needs to work. The fluid buildup that comes with it puts extra pressure on the portal vein, which brings blood to your liver. This can scar the organ to the point where it doesn't work as well as it should."
36,How does heart failure affect your body?,"As it tries to move more blood, your heart gets larger. It also pumps faster, and your blood vessels narrow to get more blood out to your body. As your heart works harder, it becomes weaker and the damage increases. Your body gets less oxygen, and you might notice symptoms like shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, and fluid buildup. Your body tries to keep the blood it has to supply your heart and brain. This leaves less for organs like your kidneys and liver. A lack of enough blood can damage these organs. When the rhythm is off, your heart can't pump enough blood out to your body."
37,What kinds of atypical antidepressants can treat depression in older adults?,"The type of medication your doctor prescribes will depend on many things, including your: Symptoms Health Other conditions you have and medications you're taking Meds you may get include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) like: Citalopram ( Celexa) Escitalopram ( Lexapro) Fluoxetine ( Prozac) Paroxetine ( Paxil) Sertraline ( Zoloft) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) like: Desvenlafaxine ( Pristiq) Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Venlafaxine ( Effexor) Atypical antidepressa nts, such as: Bupropion ( Wellbutrin) Trazodone ( Oleptro ER) Mirtazapine ( Remeron) Monamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs), like: Isocarboxazid ( Marplan) Phenelzine ( Nardil) Selegiline ( Emsam, Zelapar, Eldepryl) Tranylcypromine ( Parnate) There's another class of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants, but they aren't used much in older adults because they have more side effects."
37,What conditions are linked with depression in older adults?,"It's common for depression to come with other health issues that often crop up after 65, like: Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease Heart disease Cancer Arthritis Sometimes it can be the medication for the above conditions that's to blame for depression symptoms.

37,Can electroconvulsive therapy help treat depression in older adults?,It involves passing a brief small electrical current through electrodes placed on your scalp while you are under general anesthesia. This causes a brief seizure. That seizure causes a change to the chemistry in your brain. Researchers believe that change helps with your depression. Doctors usually try medication and therapy for a while before trying ECT.

There are two types: Invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) Ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS), also called intraductal carcinoma The symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments for each are different."
40,What can ductal carcinoma in situ lead do?,"Even though it's noninvasive, it can lead to invasive cancer. It's important that women with the disease get treatment. Research shows that the risk of getting invasive cancer is low if you've been treated for DCIS. If it isn't treated, 30% to 50% if women with DCIS will get invasive cancer. The invasive cancer usually develops in the same breast and in the same area as where the DCIS happened."
40,How is ductal carcinoma in situ treated?,"The treatment options are usually: Lumpectomy: The surgeon only removes the tumor and a bit of the tissue around it to help make sure all the cancer cells have been removed. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy. Instead, they have a lumpectomy. Most common is a lumpectomy followed by radiation. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it. Lymph nodes under the arm don't need to be removed as they are with other types of breast cancer."
40,What is the treatment plan for ductal carcinoma in situ based on?,"The invasive cancer usually develops in the same breast and in the same area as where the DCIS happened. Your doctor will customize your treatment plan based on your test results and medical history. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy."
40,When do you need radiation for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ?,"It uses low doses of radiation to make pictures of the inside of your chest. It can be local, regional, and/or distant. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it. After a lumpectomy, radiation cuts the chances that the cancer will come back. If cancer does return, it's called recurrence. Some women may opt to have a lumpectomy only."
40,How is invasive ductal carcinoma treated?,"Most women with IDC have surgery to remove the cancer. Which one you get depends on the size of your tumor and how much it has spread throughout your breast and surrounding lymph nodes. In addition to surgery, other treatments include: Radiation: This usually follows your surgery."
40,What procedures are done to treat invasive ductal carcinoma?,"Chemotherapy: These medications target cancer cells throughout your body. Among other things, your doctor will consider: Tumor location Tumor size Aggressiveness of the cancer cells Your family history of breast cancer Results of tests for a gene mutation that would increase the risk of breast cancer Most women with DCIS don't have the breast removed with a mastectomy. The surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it."
40,What tests are used to further diagnose invasive ductal carcinoma?,"Invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) accounts for about 80% of all invasive breast cancers in women and 90% in men. PET scan. The doctor injects a radioactive substance called a tracer into your arm. Together with a CT scan, this test can help find cancer in lymph nodes and other areas. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the breast and other structures inside your body. Bone scan. It uses low doses of radiation to make pictures of the inside of your chest. Results from these tests will show the stage of your cancer. Node ( N): Has the tumor spread to your lymph nodes? These tests may include an ultrasound or MRI."
41,How can you get help for emotional eating?,"Try meditation or counseling, or talk to your doctor to see what resources and techniques they recommend to help you cope with emotional stress. As you learn to practice better coping strategies and to curb emotional eating, remember to reward yourself. By patting yourself on the back for a job well done, you increase the likelihood that you'll maintain your new healthy habits."
42,How do I choose my therapist if I have type 2 diabetes?,"Look for a licensed mental health professional who works with people who have diabetes or other long-term conditions. Ask your doctor for referrals. Pick someone you find easy to talk to. You might meet with your counselor one on one, with family members, or in a support group."
42,Should I join a support group for type 2 diabetes?,"It helps to talk to someone who can relate to what you're going through, since they have diabetes, too. While support groups are not psychotherapy groups, they can provide you with a safe, accepting place to share your situation and get comfort and encouragement."
42,Should I tell my friends and family about my type 2 diabetes?,"Type 2 diabetes can seem overwhelming at times, but you can take control back. Share with them what you're going through and how you manage your diabetes. For instance, tell them why you have to check your blood sugar regularly, or what sorts of snacks and meals are OK for you. Want someone to help you get them up to speed?"
42,What can help for my type 2 diabetes?,"Put them on your go-to list, and reach out any time you need their insight and motivation. It helps to talk to someone who can relate to what you're going through, since they have diabetes, too. Type 2 diabetes can affect the entire family."
42,Do I need a therapist if I have type 2 diabetes?,"In therapy, you'll plan positive ways to handle your diabetes. It's not just for people with conditions like depression or anxiety. Anyone can benefit. Pick someone you find easy to talk to."
42,How can I tell my family about my type 2 diabetes?,"You might want to hold a family meeting, and invite your diabetes educator to answer their questions. Pick someone you find easy to talk to."
43,Do prescription dugs help treat IBS?,"Your doctor may also prescribe drugs to help with diarrhea or constipation if you need more relief. Other things that can help include stress management, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and relaxation training."
43,How is irritable bowel disease (IBD) treated?,"IBD, on the other hand, is more often treated with drugs that target the inflammation that causes symptoms. These powerful meds generally don't work as a treatment for IBS, which is one reason why it's so important to know which condition you have. And while some people with IBD need surgery to repair the physical damage to their digestive tract, surgery isn't needed for IBS."
43,Is IBS or IBD related to colorectal cancer?,"Lastly, an inflammatory bowel disease makes you more likely to get colorectal cancer. Irritable bowel syndrome doesn't do that, but you should still keep up with your regularly scheduled screening tests."
43,Do IBD and IBS share symptoms?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. Plus, they both tend to be diagnosed in young people."
43,Is counseling helpful in treating IBS?,"Counseling is also helpful, especially if the stress of having the condition starts to get to you, or if you notice you're limiting your social life because you worry about when your symptoms will affect you. A support group is another great resource, because the people there will understand, from personal experience, what it's like to have IBS."
43,What are symptoms of IBS?,"IBS can also cause constipation, extra gas, nausea, or make you feel like you urgently need to have a bowel movement."
43,What is another natural alternative for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"Counseling is also helpful, especially if the stress of having the condition starts to get to you, or if you notice you're limiting your social life because you worry about when your symptoms will affect you. A support group is another great resource, because the people there will understand, from personal experience, what it's like to have IBS."
43,Is irritable bowel disease (IBD) a structural or functional disease?,"IBD is a structural disease. That means there is underlying physical damage that causes your symptoms. Doctors can see chronic inflammation or ulcers when they examine the gut with an X-ray, endoscopy, surgery, or biopsy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases."
43,What else can help with diarrhea or constipation besides drugs?,"Your doctor may also prescribe drugs to help with diarrhea or constipation if you need more relief. Other things that can help include stress management, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and relaxation training. Researchers are also studying whether probiotics help tame IBS."
43,What symptoms do irritable bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) share?,"Both can cause stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. But that's where the similarities end. IBS and IBD have different causes and treatments. You can't tell which it is by how you feel, and you need to know the difference so you can get the right type of help."
43,What are some overlapping warning signs of irritable bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. Plus, they both tend to be diagnosed in young people. IBS can also cause constipation, extra gas, nausea, or make you feel like you urgently need to have a bowel movement."
43,How is IBD diagnosed?,"Since it's a structural disease, a doctor needs to find physical damage in your gut to make the diagnosis. To look for inflammation, ulcers, and bleeding, you may get: Tests of your blood and stools A colonoscopy or other imaging tests to look inside your gut, with a biopsy CT scans If you have inflammation and ulcers, your doctor can use these tests to narrow down what form of IBD you have. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types."
43,What are some harmful consequences of having an inflammatory bowel disease?,"Lastly, an inflammatory bowel disease makes you more likely to get colorectal cancer. Irritable bowel syndrome doesn't do that, but you should still keep up with your regularly scheduled screening tests."
43,What are the causes of IBS and IBD?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. The long-lasting inflammation in the digestive tracts of people with IBD can cause bleeding and ulcers (sores). In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. Scientists have found links between irritable bowel syndrome and the immune system, and how muscles move food through the gut. Many people have certain triggers that cause their symptoms to get worse, including some foods, stress, infections, and hormonal changes."
43,Do any specific diet changes help treat IBS?,"People with IBS often try to treat it by changing what they eat. There is no specific diet that works for everyone who has the condition. Stop lactose, which is in dairy products. Cut down on foods that make you gassy or bloated. Get more water. Avoid caffeine and legumes (beans). Limit or avoid â FODMAPsâ (a certain type of sugar found in some fruit, vegetable, bread and dairy products)."
43,What causes irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and irritable bowel disease (IBD)?,"Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. The long-lasting inflammation in the digestive tracts of people with IBD can cause bleeding and ulcers (sores). In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. The causes of IBS aren't as clear."
43,How do doctors treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and irritable bowel disease (IBD)?,"People with IBS often try to treat it by changing what they eat. There is no specific diet that works for everyone who has the condition. Cut down on foods that make you gassy or bloated. Get more water. ( You can drink it or eat H2 O-rich foods.) Avoid caffeine and legumes (beans). Limit or avoid â FODMAPsâ (a certain type of sugar found in some fruit, vegetable, bread and dairy products)."
43,How do doctors diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"Doctors use something called the â Rome criteriaâ to decide if you have irritable bowel syndrome. According to the criteria, you may be diagnosed with IBS if you have belly pain for at least 1 day a week for the previous 3 months. The pain must also meet at least two of the following: It is associated with a bowel movement. In some cases, doctors will diagnose you with IBS just using these standards. But in many cases, especially if you also have other symptoms that hint at IBD, you'll get tests to find out whether there's any bleeding or inflammation in your digestive tract. If there is, then you don't have IBS."
43,Is irritable bowel disease (IBS) a structural or functional disease?,"IBS, on the other hand, is what doctors call a functional disease. Someone with this type of disease will have a group of symptoms, but tests won't show any physical explanation for those problems. Since it's a structural disease, a doctor needs to find physical damage in your gut to make the diagnosis."
43,What are some links between irritable bowel syndrome and the immune system?,"In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. Many people have certain triggers that cause their symptoms to get worse, including some foods, stress, infections, and hormonal changes."
43,Is IBD a structural or functional disease?,"IBS, on the other hand, is what doctors call a functional disease. Someone with this type of disease will have a group of symptoms, but tests won't show any physical explanation for those problems. But in many cases, especially if you also have other symptoms that hint at IBD, you'll get tests to find out whether there's any bleeding or inflammation in your digestive tract."
44,What are the symptoms of kidney disease?,"The symptoms of kidney disease include: High/worsening blood pressure Decrease in amount of urine or difficulty urinating Edema (fluid retention), especially in the lower legs A need to urinate more often, especially at night As with high blood pressure, you may not realize that you have kidney disease."
44,How can I prevent kidney disease from high blood pressure?,"However, certain groups are at higher risk, including: African- Americans Hispanic- Americans Native Americans Natives of Alaska People who have diabetes People with a family history of high blood pressure and kidney disease To prevent kidney damage from high blood pressure: Try to keep your blood pressure controlled. Make sure you get your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. Eat a proper diet. Get moderate exercise, such as walking, 30 minutes daily. Take the medication your doctor prescribes. For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease, the most important treatment is to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes."
44,What is the leading cause of kidney disease?,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a leading cause of kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels and filters in the kidney, making removal of waste from the body difficult. Once a person is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, dialysis -- a blood-cleansing process -- or kidney transplantation are necessary."
44,How is kidney disease diagnosed?,"The symptoms of kidney disease include: High/worsening blood pressure Decrease in amount of urine or difficulty urinating Edema (fluid retention), especially in the lower legs A need to urinate more often, especially at night As with high blood pressure, you may not realize that you have kidney disease. Certain laboratory tests can indicate whether your kidneys are eliminating waste products properly. These tests include serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ( BUN); elevated levels of either can indicate kidney damage. Proteinuria, an excess of protein in the urine, is also a sign of kidney disease."
44,How is kidney disease treated?,"Eat a proper diet. For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease, the most important treatment is to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB) drugs lower blood pressure and can protect the kidneys from further damage, but treatments need to be individualized."
45,Can you get flaxseed naturally from foods?,"While no other food sources contain flaxseed, flaxseed is itself sometimes added to foods. Ground flaxseed is sold as flour. Flaxseed oil might be added to salad dressing, but it should not be used for cooking."
45,Why do people take flaxseed?,"Flaxseed and flaxseed oil contain alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA), one of the essential omega-3 fatty acids that partly and inefficiently converts into DHA and EPA -- more active omega-3s -- in the body. While flaxseed hasn't yet been shown to improve heart disease risk, there's good evidence that flaxseed and flaxseed oil may lower cholesterol levels. Ground flaxseed -- but not flaxseed oil -- may also help with menopausal symptoms. One study showed that 40 grams per day may be similar to hormone therapy for improving mild menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. But other studies contradict this finding. Ground flaxseed may also ease constipation. Flaxseed has also been shown to improve kidney function in people with lupus. If you have lupus -- or any other medical condition -- it's very important to talk with your doctor about any supplements you take."
45,What are the risks of taking flaxseed?,"Never eat raw or unripe flaxseed -- it could be poisonous. People who have diabetes, bipolar disorder, high triglycerides, bleeding disorders, or prostate cancer should talk to a doctor before using flaxseed or flaxseed oil. Anyone with digestive problems (like Crohn's disease, IBS, or colitis) and women with hormone-sensitive diseases (like endometriosis, PCOS, breast cancer, and uterine cancer) should not use flaxseed. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, flaxseed and flaxseed oil is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
45,What are the side effects of taking flaxseed?,"At normal doses, flaxseed and flaxseed oil seem to be safe. Flaxseed -- and not flaxseed oil -- contains soluble fiber. It might cause diarrhea, cramping, gas, and bloating. High doses of flaxseed, especially when not taken with enough water, can cause constipation and, rarely, bowel obstruction. If ground flaxseed or flaxseed oil oxidizes (goes rancid), it may cause cholesterol problems and inflammation."
45,What are interactions that can occur from taking flaxseed?,"If you have lupus -- or any other medical condition -- it's very important to talk with your doctor about any supplements you take. Flaxseed may block the normal absorption of medicines. Always take medicines at least one hour before or two hours after using flaxseed. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil may also interact with drugs like blood thinners, NSAID painkillers, hormone treatments, and some medicines for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes."
45,How much flaxseed should you take?,"There is no set dose of flaxseed. In studies of people with high cholesterol, 15 to 50 grams of flaxseed per day has been used; 40 grams have been used for mild menopause symptoms. Flaxseed must be ground prior to ingestion or it won't work for these conditions. To be absorbed, however, it must me ground before using it to allow the oils to be available. Some people use a small coffee grinder to grind daily doses as needed."
46,What is vaginismus?,"When a woman has vaginismus, her vagina's muscles squeeze or spasm when something is entering it, like a tampon or a penis. It can be mildly uncomfortable, or it can be painful. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } There are exercises a woman can do that can help, sometimes within weeks."
46,What causes vaginismus?,"The pain happens only with penetration. It's usually linked to anxietyand fear of having sex. But it's unclear which came first, the vaginismus or the anxiety. Other medical problems like infections can also cause painful intercourse. So it's important to see a doctor to determine the underlying cause of pain during sex."
46,What exercise or therapy can help prevent vaginismus?,"Relax the muscles. You can do them as many times a day as you want to. After a few days, insert one finger, up to about the first knuckle joint, inside the vagina while doing the exercises. It's a good idea to clip your fingernails first and use a lubricating jelly. For women whose vaginismus is related to fear or anxiety, therapy helps."
46,What are symptoms of vaginismus?,"When a woman has vaginismus, her vagina's muscles squeeze or spasm when something is entering it, like a tampon or a penis. It usually goes away after withdrawal, but not always. Many women who have vaginismus also feel discomfort when inserting a tampon or during a doctor's internal pelvic exam. Others have it only in certain circumstances, like with one partner but not others, or only with sexual intercourse but not with tampons or during medical exams."
46,What is the treatment for vaginismus?,"The approach is called progressive desensitization, and the idea is to get comfortable with insertion. Relax the muscles."
47,How can you clean a minor cut?,"If it's a minor cut or scrape, here's what to do: Clean the Cut First wash your hands with soap and water. Then rinse the cut or scrape with cool water to remove dirt and debris. Hold the area under running water or pour clean water over it from a cup. Use soap to clean the wound. You don't need to use stronger cleaning solutions -- such as hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol -- to treat minor cuts and scrapes, as they may irritate the wound. Cool clean water should be fine for cleaning the wound."
47,How should you cover a cut or scrape?,"Cover the Cut or Scrape Once the bleeding has stopped and the wound is clean, you should cover it with a sterile bandage or gauze pad and tape. If the cut is small and is in an area that won't get dirty and be rubbed by your clothes, you may decide to leave it uncovered. But for most wounds, it's a good idea to cover them to help prevent infection or reopening the wound. Change the dressing or bandage every day or more often if it gets dirty. Antibiotic ointment can make infection less likely. Using a thin layer of antibiotic ointment before applying the bandage or gauze dressing will help keep cuts and scrapes clean and moist, and help curb scarring."
47,How can you stop the bleeding of a minor cut or scrape?,"Stop the Bleeding A small amount of blood can help clean out the wound. Smaller cuts and abrasions usually stop bleeding on their own. A cut to the head or hand may bleed more because those areas have a lot of blood vessels. To stop the bleeding, gently apply firm, direct pressure using a clean cloth or gauze. Continue to hold the pressure steadily. Don't raise the cloth or gauze to check on the wound, because that could cause the wound to start bleeding again. If blood seeps through the dressing, just put more on top and keep applying pressure. If the cut is on your hand or arm, you can help slow the bleeding by raising it above your head. If the cut spurts blood or if it doesn't stop bleeding, get medical help right away."
47,What are the signs of an infection in a cut or scrape?,"Watch for Signs of Infection If the wound isn't healing or you notice any of these signs of infection, call your doctor right away: Redness, swelling, and warmth Increasing pain Pus or drainage from the cut Fever Red streaks around the wound When the Wound Starts to Heal Small cuts and scrapes will form a scab and heal within a few days."
47,When does a scrape or cut begin to heal?,"Watch for Signs of Infection If the wound isn't healing or you notice any of these signs of infection, call your doctor right away: Redness, swelling, and warmth Increasing pain Pus or drainage from the cut Fever Red streaks around the wound When the Wound Starts to Heal Small cuts and scrapes will form a scab and heal within a few days. The scab helps protect the wound from dirt and germs while new skin grows underneath. Once a scab has formed, you may not need to use a bandage anymore. Although a healing wound or scab will itch, it's best not to scratch or pick at scabs. The scab will fall off on its own without your help, revealing the new skin underneath."
47,When should you call the doctor about minor cuts or scrapes?,"When to Call the Doctor Most minor cuts and abrasions don't need a doctor's care. But call your doctor if: The wound is on your face. The edges of the cut are jagged or gape open, the cut is deep (1/4 inch or more), or you can see fat or muscle. These are signs that you may need stitches. You can't get all of the dirt or debris out of the wound, or the wound was caused by something very dirty or rusty. You have a puncture wound or a cut and haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years. The wound is from an animal or human bite. The injured area feels numb."
47,What should you know about treating minor cuts and scrapes?,"All it takes is one slip of focus while slicing bread and you've cut your finger. Or you trip on a curb and skin your knee. Get immediate medical attention for a wound that is deep, bleeds heavily, or has something embedded in it. Stop the Bleeding A small amount of blood can help clean out the wound."
48,What are symptoms of a diaper rash?,"Identifying a diaper rash is usually fairly easy. The rash is located on skin underneath the diaper area. The skin is red and irritated. It may appear all over your baby's bottom or genital area, or only in certain places. It may or may not involve the folds of the skin."
49,What are the symptoms of occupational asthma?,"These substances may cause asthma in one of 3 ways: An allergic reaction (like people with allergies who develop allergic asthma) An irritant reaction (like a person that reacts to smoking with asthma) A reaction which results in the buildup of naturally occurring chemicals such as histamines in the lungs resulting in an asthma attack Examples of occupational asthma -- also called work-related asthma -- include: Health care workers who develop an allergy to latex gloves by breathing in the powdered proteins from the inner lining of the gloves Workers in the chemical industry who are exposed to substances like ammonia and develop symptoms of asthma as the result of an irritant effects, not an allergic reaction There are numerous substances used in various industries that can trigger occupational asthma including: Chemicals such as adhesives, shellac and lacquer, plastics, epoxy resins, carpeting, foam and rubber, insulation, dyes (textile workers), and enzymes in detergents Proteins in animal hair and/or dander Grains, green coffee beans, and papain (an extract of papaya that may trigger a latex allergy) Cotton, flax, and hemp dust, commonly found in the textile industry Metals such as platinum, chromium, nickel sulfate, and soldering fumes Generally, if your asthma symptoms are worse on days that you work, improve when you are at home for any length of time (weekends, vacations) and then recur when you return to work, occupational asthma should be considered. Symptoms of occupational asthma include general symptoms of an asthma attack, such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulty. Eye irritation, nasal congestion, and/or runny nose may also be present. As stated previously, this can be allergy-related or an irritant reaction from exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace."
49,How can I treat my occupational asthma?,"If you think you have occupational asthma, ask your health care provider about a referral to an asthma specialist. The specialist will perform a detailed exam, including taking your past medical history and reviewing current breathing problems. After any necessary asthma tests, the specialist will develop an asthma treatment plan, which will include asthma medications, such as bronchodilators, asthma inhalers, and inhaled steroids to control your asthma. It will also be important to avoid any asthma triggers at work."
49,How do I know if my asthma could be work-related?,"These substances may cause asthma in one of 3 ways: An allergic reaction (like people with allergies who develop allergic asthma) An irritant reaction (like a person that reacts to smoking with asthma) A reaction which results in the buildup of naturally occurring chemicals such as histamines in the lungs resulting in an asthma attack Examples of occupational asthma -- also called work-related asthma -- include: Health care workers who develop an allergy to latex gloves by breathing in the powdered proteins from the inner lining of the gloves Workers in the chemical industry who are exposed to substances like ammonia and develop symptoms of asthma as the result of an irritant effects, not an allergic reaction There are numerous substances used in various industries that can trigger occupational asthma including: Chemicals such as adhesives, shellac and lacquer, plastics, epoxy resins, carpeting, foam and rubber, insulation, dyes (textile workers), and enzymes in detergents Proteins in animal hair and/or dander Grains, green coffee beans, and papain (an extract of papaya that may trigger a latex allergy) Cotton, flax, and hemp dust, commonly found in the textile industry Metals such as platinum, chromium, nickel sulfate, and soldering fumes Generally, if your asthma symptoms are worse on days that you work, improve when you are at home for any length of time (weekends, vacations) and then recur when you return to work, occupational asthma should be considered."

49,How can my workplace help me with my occupational asthma?,"These substances may cause asthma in one of 3 ways: An allergic reaction (like people with allergies who develop allergic asthma) An irritant reaction (like a person that reacts to smoking with asthma) A reaction which results in the buildup of naturally occurring chemicals such as histamines in the lungs resulting in an asthma attack Examples of occupational asthma -- also called work-related asthma -- include: Health care workers who develop an allergy to latex gloves by breathing in the powdered proteins from the inner lining of the gloves Workers in the chemical industry who are exposed to substances like ammonia and develop symptoms of asthma as the result of an irritant effects, not an allergic reaction There are numerous substances used in various industries that can trigger occupational asthma including: Chemicals such as adhesives, shellac and lacquer, plastics, epoxy resins, carpeting, foam and rubber, insulation, dyes (textile workers), and enzymes in detergents Proteins in animal hair and/or dander Grains, green coffee beans, and papain (an extract of papaya that may trigger a latex allergy) Cotton, flax, and hemp dust, commonly found in the textile industry Metals such as platinum, chromium, nickel sulfate, and soldering fumes Generally, if your asthma symptoms are worse on days that you work, improve when you are at home for any length of time (weekends, vacations) and then recur when you return to work, occupational asthma should be considered. However, if in a particular job, exposure to asthma triggers is unavoidable, most employers are willing to assist the employee to find a more suitable workplace. Once it has been determined what causes your asthma, discuss with your health care provider how best to approach your employer and what precautions need to be taken."

To help make a diagnosis, some doctors simply look at your symptoms and whether avoiding dairy products for 2 weeks relieves them."
50,What is lactose intolerance?,"Lactose is the main sugar in milk and most other dairy products. Your small intestine makes the enzyme lactase to help you digest that sugar. When you're lactose intolerant, you don't make enough lactase to digest lactose well. You can't cure lactose intolerance, but if you change what and how you eat, you may get rid of your symptoms."

Example: If you finish your homework properly and on time, you can play a video game. Token economy: This combines the reward and consequence ideas. Teachers often use this method by giving out things like star stickers, but the same principle should be used at home, too. Response cost: Unwanted behavior leads to a loss of privileges or rewards. Example: If you don't do your homework, you lose your computer time. Time out: This common consequence is often used when preschoolers use bad behavior. Example: If you hit your sister, you must sit quietly alone for a few minutes."

53,What are new ways to prevent tooth decay?,"One study found that a chewing gum that contains the sweetener xylitol temporarily retarded the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, several materials that slowly release fluoride over time, which will help prevent further decay, are being explored. These materials would be placed between teeth or in pits and fissures of teeth. Toothpastes and mouth rinses that can reverse and ""heal"" early cavities are also being studied."
54,What would a doctor give a patient with paranoid schizophrenia?,"Your doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic drug to make the delusions go away. It could be pills, a liquid, or shots. It can take a few weeks for these drugs to work fully, but you could start to feel a little calmer quickly. You might need to try more than one to find a medication or combination that's right for you."
54,How can counseling help treat paranoid schizophrenics?,"Once your delusions are under control, counseling can help you get along with others, hold a job, go to school, take care of yourself, and have friends.

55,What can you expect prior to transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer?,"You first may need a blood test and chest X-ray to make sure you're healthy enough to have TUR surgery, but your surgeon won't need to make a cut into your skin. He'll get to your bladder through your urethra -- the tube pee goes through as it passes out of your body. Before the surgery, you'll have either general anesthesia -- which puts you to sleep -- or regional anesthesia that numbs just the lower part of your body. The procedure starts once that medicine starts to work."
55,What is transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer?,It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. Doctors also take out tumors this way.
55,How can you recover from transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer?,"It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. You may need to have it in for a few days before you can go on your own. Drink lots of fluid to help flush out your bladder -- aim for 8 to 10 glasses per day. This also can help keep an infection away. Don't lift anything heavy for 2 to 3 weeks after your surgery. Short walks are OK, but don't do any intense exercise for 4 to 6 weeks. Talk with your doctor about when you can drive and go back to work."
55,How is transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer done?,"It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. He'll pass it up through your urethra into your bladder. The camera shows the surgeon the inside of your bladder. He'll use the cutting tool to take some tissue, then he'll use heat on the areas around the cut to stop the bleeding. The tissue that's taken out during the surgery will be looked at under a microscope in a lab to see if it's cancer. If your surgeon removed a cancerous tumor, she may put a liquid medication into your bladder to kill any cancer cells that are left."
55,What happens after transurethral resection (TUR) surgery for bladder cancer?,"It's a type of surgery used to take samples of tissue from inside your bladder to find out if you have cancer there or if a tumor has spread. He'll get to your bladder through your urethra -- the tube pee goes through as it passes out of your body. The camera shows the surgeon the inside of your bladder. You may need to have it in for a few days before you can go on your own. If you do, be sure to let your doctor or nurse know. A numbing gel can help. Many people go home the same day as the surgery. But if your tumor was large, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight. You may see blood in your pee for up to 3 days after your surgery."
56,Can you inherit chronic fatigue syndrome from your parents?,"Chronic fatigue syndrome ME/ CFS can run in families. It's possible that some people inherit a risk for it from one of their parents, such as inheriting a defect in how a particular gene is built. Probably more important than how genes are built is whether genes are turned on or off properlyâdifferences in gene activity. In people with ME/ CFS, within white blood cells and other parts of the body, there are differences in gene activity. For example, several studies have found that genes important in activating the immune system are more likely to be turned on in people with ME/ CFS."
56,Does age and gender affect who gets chronic fatigue syndrome?,"If you think you may have it, or are concerned that you could be at risk, check with your doctor. If you're a woman, you're four times more likely to get ME/ CFS than men. The condition is rare in children, but girls are more likely to develop it than boys. The illness most often begins in adults aged 30-50. With teenagers, those between 13 and 15 seem to have it most often."
57,What should someone eat during breast cancer treatment?,"A diet low in total and saturated fat helps lower your risk of heart disease, and also lowers the risk that your breast cancer will return. It's important to get enough protein. This helps build and repair skin, hair, and muscles during your treatment. It may improve your ability to exercise, too. Good nutrition can help you with the side effects of chemotherapy, and help fight off infections. It lets your body rebuild healthy tissues more quickly. Also, drink plenty of fluids to stay well hydrated, and to protect your bladder and kidneys while on chemotherapy."
57,How does surgery cause weight changes during breast cancer treatment?,It's common for women who have chemotherapy to gain about 5 to 14 pounds over a year.
57,How important is exercise during breast cancer treatment?,"It's really good for your overall health -- but talk to your doctor before you begin any exercise program. Physical activity can often help reduce the side effects of nausea and fatigue. It can also lift your energy levels. One study found that exercise after chemotherapy might boost infection-fighting T cells, too. Even a moderate amount of exercise may help you live longer. Strength training can help rebuild body mass and increase your strength. You need to take care when working with weights on the upper body, though. That's because lymphedema -- arm swelling -- is a common concern after breast cancer treatment."
57,What can cause weight loss during breast cancer treatment?,"It's typically due to a poor appetite or nausea, which can be a side effect of chemotherapy."
57,What are the risks associated with weight changes during breast cancer treatment?,"Being overweight also puts you at risk for getting other types of cancers. Research has also shown that carrying around extra pounds can raise your risk of breast cancer recurring. Weight loss can cause you to lose energy, and poor nutrition can make it harder for you to recover. Stick to a well-balanced diet that includes fruit, vegetables, dairy products, breads, poultry, fish, and lean meat. A diet low in total and saturated fat helps lower your risk of heart disease, and also lowers the risk that your breast cancer will return."
57,How does lack of exercise cause weight gain during breast cancer treatment?,"Some research suggests that weight gain is also related to lack of exercise . When you get your cancer treatment, it's common to feel stress and have some fatigue, nausea, or pain. That can lead to a drop in how much physical activity you get."
57,How do corticosteroids affect weight change during breast cancer treatment?,"Another reason for weight gain is the use of corticosteroids. These medications help with nausea and swelling, or to stop reactions to chemotherapy. These drugs can boost your appetite. Corticosteroids are hormones that can also cause an increase in fatty tissue. They can make you lose muscle mass in your arms and legs, and gain belly fat, too. You may also have a fullness of the neck or face. Loss of muscle makes weight gain more apparent. Women treated with steroids may also put on pounds, but the weight gain is usually seen only after weeks of continuous use."
57,What might cause weight gain during breast cancer treatment?,"Many things can play a role. Chemotherapy can bring on premature menopause. Menopause also causes you to gain more body fat and lose lean muscle. It's common for women who have chemotherapy to gain about 5 to 14 pounds over a year. Some gain less, while others put on as many as 25 pounds. Weight loss can cause you to lose energy, and poor nutrition can make it harder for you to recover."
57,How does medication cause weight changes during breast cancer treatment?,"Another reason for weight gain is the use of corticosteroids. So far, though, no conclusive studies have shown a relationship between this hormone and the gains."
57,How common are weight changes during breast cancer treatment?,"Most women gain pounds, but others lose some. When you get your cancer treatment, it's common to feel stress and have some fatigue, nausea, or pain."
58,How is constipation defined for a baby?,"Constipation isn't just about how often your baby poops. It's also about how tough it is for him to do it. If he has soft, easy-to-pass stools every 4-5 days, he's probably OK. On the other hand, you should talk to your doctor if he: Has a hard time going or seems uncomfortable Has hard stools Has poops that are bloody or black Doesn't poop at least once every 5 to 10 days If you're bottle feeding, try a different brand of formula -- after you check with your doctor."

On the other hand, you should talk to your doctor if he: Has a hard time going or seems uncomfortable Has hard stools Has poops that are bloody or black Doesn't poop at least once every 5 to 10 days If you're bottle feeding, try a different brand of formula -- after you check with your doctor. Constipation should never be a reason to stop breastfeeding. Add a little dark fruit juice, like prune or pear, to your baby's bottle. Or just give her some extra water if she's older than 4 months -- no more than 1-2 ounces per day. But check with the doctor first. Remember that most babies who don't poop a lot are not truly ""constipated"" and don't need anything different from normal."
59,What are symptoms of complete urea cycle disorders (UCDs)?,"Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U. S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state."
59,What are the symptoms a baby may have from a partial urea cycle disorder (UCD)?,"They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U.

59,How are most cases of urea cycle disorders (UCDs) managed?,"In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications."
59,Who is more likely to have urea cycle disorders (UCDs)?,"They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons."
60,What lesionectomy surgery for epilepsy?,This surgery removes brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect like a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that cause seizures. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed.
61,"If I have to take my baby outdoors, how can I protect him?","Cover with clothes. Dress your baby so bugs don't have any access to skin. Loose-fitting long sleeves and pants Socks A hat Skip the bright, flowery prints. Bugs are attracted to those. Protect with a net.

61,Should I get rid of standing water to protect my baby from bug bites?,"Look around your house for soggy sites, like: Planters Birdbaths Wading pools Drill holes in tire swings to keep water from collecting. Change your pets' water bowls regularly."
61,"Once my baby is over 2 months old, can I use bug repellents?","Once your baby is a little older, you can add repellent sprays and lotions to your bug-fighting kit. According to the CDC, insect repellent is the best way to protect your baby from mosquito bites -- as long as you use it correctly. Repellents also protect from other biting bugs like ticks, fleas, chiggers, and biting flies. But they don't work for stinging bugs, like wasps, bees, and hornets."
61,Can avoiding bug hangout spots help protect your baby from bug bites?,"Flower gardens, garbage cans, piles of dead leaves, and bushes are all popular places for bug parties, so steer clear."
61,Can you use bug repellents on a baby under 2 months?,"The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) is clear: Bug repellents -- even the DEET-free ones -- are not safe for newborns. Since you can't use lotions and sprays on the very small, the best way to keep your baby from becoming a bug buffet is by avoiding bugs in the first place. Stay in. Bugs, especially mosquitoes, are most active at dawn and dusk. Keep your baby indoors during those hours to lower his bite risk. Defend your house. Make sure your windows and doors have screens to keep bugs from flying or crawling inside."
61,What bug repellents work the best?,"Research says repellents with these active ingredients work the longest: DEET I5353 Picaridin When you use DEET, choose products with less than 30%."
61,Can I put both bug repellent and sunscreen on my baby?,"If you want to put sunscreen on your baby, too, do that first. Don't use a bug repellent and sunscreen combo. You'll have to reapply it more often than repellent alone."
61,How much DEET do I need to protect my baby from bug bites?,"Research says repellents with these active ingredients work the longest: DEET I5353 Picaridin When you use DEET, choose products with less than 30%.

62,How is a needle biopsy or needle aspiration done to screen for lung cancer?,"Your doctor numbs your skin and uses a needle to remove a sample of tissue. You may hear him talk about two different types. If he uses a thin needle it's called fine needle aspiration. A procedure that uses a slightly thicker, hollow needle to remove a piece of tissue along with the cells is called a core biopsy. Your doctor may use a CT scan or X-ray to guide the needle to the right spot."
62,What are reasons besides smoking that I should get screened for lung cancer?,"Besides smoking, there are other reasons you could have higher odds of lung cancer. Your doctor may suggest you get screened if you: Spent a lot of time around chemicals such as radon, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, silica, or asbestos Already had small-cell lung cancer, or cancer of the head or neck Had radiation therapy to the chest to treat cancer Had a parent, brother or sister, or child with lung cancer Have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs) If you decide to get a screening test, you'll likely get something called low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT)."
62,Who should get screened for lung cancer?,"Experts have different views. Several health organizations, including the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, say you should do it if you're at least 55 and you are or were a long-term smoker."
62,How is an open biopsy done to screen for lung cancer?,"You need to be in a hospital operating room to get this done. A surgeon removes tissue through a cut in your chest.

A specialist called a pathologist looks at them under a microscope to check if any of them are cancer."
62,How is a sputum cytology test used to screen for lung cancer?,"This test looks for cancer cells in your mucus. To get a sample, you'll breathe deeply and then cough with enough force to bring some up from your lungs. Then you'll spit it out into a cup."
62,What happens after you have been diagnosed with lung cancer?,"But make sure you also get the emotional backing you need. Reach out to your family and friends.

It's a machine that uses X-rays to make detailed pictures of your lungs. It's a super-easy exam to take. You don't need any special prep, like fasting. You just need to hold your breath for about 6 seconds while a technician takes a scan. The whole thing takes about 10 minutes. One thing to keep in mind: Sometimes an LCDT can give a result that looks like cancer, but really isn't. Doctors call this situation a false-positive. You may need to take some other tests to double-check."

62,What imaging tests are useful in diagnosing lung cancer?,"They look for growths that might be lung cancer. Your doctor will be able to figure out if the disease has spread, and if so, where in your body it is. Some imaging tests that may be useful to make a diagnosis are: Chest X-ray. It uses radiation in low doses to make images of your lungs. CT (computed tomography). This powerful X-ray can show the size and shape of cancer, and where it is. You may get a scan of your chest and belly. If you have the disease, the doctor can see whether it has spread to places like your liver or adrenal glands. PET (positron emission tomography). It uses a special type of radiation that collects in cancer cells. A camera then takes pictures of these areas. Your doctor can use this exam to find out if a growth that showed up on an X-ray is really cancer, and to see if it's moved to other places."

If you have the disease, the doctor can see whether it has spread to places like your liver or adrenal glands."
62,What is an endoscopic ultrasound and how is it used to treat lung cancer?,"When you get this test, he inserts a needle through a lighted tube called an endoscope."
62,How does a screening test for lung cancer work?,"Your doctor may suggest you get screened if you: Spent a lot of time around chemicals such as radon, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, silica, or asbestos Already had small-cell lung cancer, or cancer of the head or neck Had radiation therapy to the chest to treat cancer Had a parent, brother or sister, or child with lung cancer Have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs) If you decide to get a screening test, you'll likely get something called low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT). It's a machine that uses X-rays to make detailed pictures of your lungs. It's a super-easy exam to take. You don't need any special prep, like fasting. You just need to hold your breath for about 6 seconds while a technician takes a scan. The whole thing takes about 10 minutes. One thing to keep in mind: Sometimes an LCDT can give a result that looks like cancer, but really isn't. Doctors call this situation a false-positive. You may need to take some other tests to double-check."
62,How is a sputum cytology used to diagnose lung cancer?,"This test looks for cancer cells in your mucus. To get a sample, you'll breathe deeply and then cough with enough force to bring some up from your lungs. Then you'll spit it out into a cup."

62,What should I do as my doctor proposes a treatment plan for my lung cancer?,"If you get a diagnosis of lung cancer, your doctor will discuss a treatment plan. But make sure you also get the emotional backing you need. Reach out to your family and friends. They can be a huge source of support while you manage and treat your condition. Also look into support groups, where you can talk to people who are going through the same things you are."

63,What do your alkaline phosphatase test results mean?,"Higher-than-normal ALP levels for your age and sex may not necessarily mean you have a problem. ( Children and teens naturally have higher levels than adults because their bones are still developing). If your ALP level is high, your doctor may have you take another test, called an ALP isoenzyme test, to determine whether the alkaline phosphatase in your blood is coming from your liver or your bones."
63,How is an alkaline phosphatase test done?,"Other conditions that can cause problems with your liver include: Liver cancer Cirrhosis Hepatitis Blockage in the bile ducts The test can also spot problems with your bones, including: Cancers that have spread to your bones Paget's disease, which affects how bones grow Issues caused by vitamin D deficiency The lab will need a small amount of blood to perform the test. The person in charge of taking your blood will start by placing a tight elastic band, called a tourniquet, around your upper arm. This makes your veins swell with blood. The lab tech will clean an area of your skin with a germ-killing solution. ( It might be a spot inside your elbow or the back of your hand). You'll feel a small stick when the needle goes into your vein. The blood flows into a small vial attached to the needle. When the test is done, the lab tech will take the tourniquet off, and you'll get a bandage on the spot where the needle went in. It takes only a few minutes."
64,How is a kissing bug bite treated?,"You usually don't need to do anything. You can wash the bitten area with soap and water.

64,Can kissing bugs cause Chagas disease?,"Kissing bugs sometimes have a parasite in their poop that causes Chagas disease. In most people, that causes mild or no symptoms. But in some, the infection can lead to serious, long-term heart problems or disease in the intestines. Chagas disease from a kissing bug is very rare in humans in the U. S. But the number of cases is growing in southern parts of the country."
64,What are kissing bugs?,"They don't kiss. But they might bite you, probably while you sleep. Most bites are harmless. Sometimes, though, they can cause allergic reactions or spread disease.

By contrast, people who add no salt to their food show virtually no traces of essential hypertension."
65,What causes high blood pressure?,"The exact causes of high blood pressure are not known, but several things may play a role, including: Smoking Being overweight or obese Lack of physical activity Too much salt in the diet Too much alcohol consumption (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day) Stress Older age Genetics Family history of high blood pressure Chronic kidney disease Adrenal and thyroid disorders Sleep apnea Essential Hypertension In as many as 95% of high blood pressure cases in the U. S., the underlying cause can't be found."
65,What other factors can raise the risk of having essential hypertension?,"Most people with high blood pressure are ""salt sensitive,"" meaning that anything more than the minimal bodily need for salt is too much for them and increases their blood pressure. Other factors that can raise the risk of having essential hypertension include obesity; diabetes; stress; insufficient intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium; lack of physical activity; and chronic alcohol consumption."
65,"What is ""normal"" blood pressure?","The top number is called the systolic, and bottom number is called the diastolic.

S., the underlying cause can't be found. This type of high blood pressure is called ""essential hypertension."""
65,What is secondary hypertension?,"Secondary Hypertension When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. Among the known causes of secondary hypertension, kidney disease ranks highest. Hypertension can also be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause the adrenal glands (small glands that sit atop the kidneys) to secrete excess amounts of the hormones that elevate blood pressure. Birth control pills -- specifically those containing estrogen -- and pregnancy can boost blood pressure, as can medications that constrict blood vessels."
65,What is blood pressure?,"The heart pumps blood into blood vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood out to the body and contributes to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, to stroke, kidney disease, and to heart failure."
65,What risk factors are linked to essential hypertension?,"High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood out to the body and contributes to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, to stroke, kidney disease, and to heart failure. Age and race also play a role. In the United States, blacks are twice as likely as whites to have high blood pressure, although the gap begins to narrow around age 44. After age 65, black women have the highest incidence of high blood pressure."
66,How do I wrap my ankle when it has been sprained?,"RICE stands for ârest, ice, compress, and elevate.â Here's how it works: Rest the ankle (use crutches if needed) Ice the ankle for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 2 days Compress (wrap) the ankle lightly -- not tightly -- with an elastic bandage or ankle brace For the first 48 hours, elevate (raise) the ankle higher than your heart whenever you're lying down Take the compression wrap out of the packaging and unroll it. Place a small section of the cloth just behind your toes and begin to wrap it in a spiral toward your heart. Each layer should cover about half the width of the previous one. Continue wrapping around the foot, heel, and ankle until every bit of skin -- up to several inches above the injury -- is covered."
67,What is a heart CT scan?,"A heart computerized tomography ( CT) scan, also called a calcium-score screening heart scan, is used to find calcium deposits in plaque of people with heart disease. They're the most effective way to spot atherosclerosis before symptoms develop. The more coronary calcium you have, the more coronary atherosclerosis you have. That gives you a higher chance of cardiovascular problems in the future. Some kinds of coronary disease don't show up in a CT scan, so it's important to remember that this test can't completely predict things like a heart attack."
67,Can you keep taking medications before a heart CT scan?,"You can continue to take your medications. But you should avoid caffeine and smoking for 4 hours before the test. CT scanners use X-rays, so this is not recommended if you are pregnant."
67,What happens during a heart CT scan?,"You'll lie on a special scanning table. The technologist will clean three small areas of your chest and place small, sticky electrode patches there. This will help your coronary arteries to show up. During the scan, you'll feel the table move inside a doughnut-shaped scanner. The high-speed CT scan gets many images, in sync with your heartbeat. The whole thing takes only a few minutes."

They can walk normally and have only small lingering issues. Another third have problems walking. They also may have muscle spasms, a less sensitive sense of touch, or trouble controlling their bladder. Continue Reading Below The remaining third are no longer able to walk and need help with many everyday activities. Doctors don't know why transverse myelitis affects some people more than others. They do think that the faster your symptoms show up, the harder it may be for you to recover. Early treatment and physical therapy can help."

70,How can plasma exchange therapy help treat transverse myelitis?,"Plasma exchange therapy: If steroids don't lower your inflammation, this treatment, also called plasmapheresis, might. The doctor will replace your blood plasma (the liquid part that holds the blood cells). This might get rid of something in it that's causing your immune system to attack your body and keep it from damaging other organs."
70,How does magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnose transverse myelitis?,"Your doctor will run tests to figure out if you have transverse myelitis or some other condition. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) or computerized tomography ( CT) scan: These tests created detailed images of your insides. They'll show the doctor if something else is affecting your nerves, like a tumor, a slipped disk, or narrowing of the channel that holds your spinal cord."

71,What are common signs of high-output heart failure?,"They can include: Shortness of breath Tiredness or weakness Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, or abdomen Lasting cough or wheezing Fast or irregular heartbeat Dizziness Confusion Having to go to the bathroom more often at night Nausea Lack of appetite To figure out if you have heart failure, your doctor will: Examine you Ask about your medical history Run some tests Those tests might include: Blood tests: Abnormal levels of important substances can show strain to organs due to heart failure."
71,How will your doctor figure out if you have high-output heart failure?,"They can include: Shortness of breath Tiredness or weakness Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, or abdomen Lasting cough or wheezing Fast or irregular heartbeat Dizziness Confusion Having to go to the bathroom more often at night Nausea Lack of appetite To figure out if you have heart failure, your doctor will: Examine you Ask about your medical history Run some tests Those tests might include: Blood tests: Abnormal levels of important substances can show strain to organs due to heart failure."
71,What causes high-output heart failure?,The things that lead to high-output heart failure are different from what brings other types of the condition. Many disorders make you need more blood to keep your organs working well. They include: Obesity Liver disease Anemia Hyperthyroidism Pregnancy Lung disease Septic shock Paget's disease Arteriovenous fistula Beriberi heart disease Common signs of high-output heart failure are similar to those of other types.
71,What tests might your doctor suggest to find out if you have high-output heart failure?,"They can include: Shortness of breath Tiredness or weakness Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, or abdomen Lasting cough or wheezing Fast or irregular heartbeat Dizziness Confusion Having to go to the bathroom more often at night Nausea Lack of appetite To figure out if you have heart failure, your doctor will: Examine you Ask about your medical history Run some tests Those tests might include: Blood tests: Abnormal levels of important substances can show strain to organs due to heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( EKG): This records the electrical activity of your heart. Chest X-ray: It will let your doctor know if you have an enlarged heart. It can also show congestion. Echocardiogram: This uses sound waves to make a video image of your heart. Exercise test: You may hear this called a stress test. It will show any blockages or weakened arteries."
71,What is high-output heart failure?,"Usually, if you have heart failure, your heart isn't pumping enough blood through your body to help it work the way it should. With the high-output version, it's pumping a normal amount of blood -- or even more than normal. Still, your body isn't getting enough to help it work well. The things that lead to high-output heart failure are different from what brings other types of the condition. Many of the causes of high-output heart failure are curable."
71,How is high-output heart failure treated?,"The things that lead to high-output heart failure are different from what brings other types of the condition. It's a good idea to treat the underlying cause first. Your doctor may suggest other treatments, including a diet low in salt and water. You may also take diuretics (water pills) to help ease swelling. Taking traditional heart failure drugs will often not help. They can make things worse. There are medicines called vasoconstrictor adrenergics that can help by making your blood vessels smaller."
72,What is cystic acne?,"You get a pimple when a pore in your skin gets clogged, usually with dead skin cells. Sometimes bacteria get trapped inside the pore, too, causing the area to become red and swollen. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Cystic acne happens when this infection goes deep into your skin, creating a red, tender bump that's full of pus. It may hurt or itch. If a cyst bursts, the infection can spread, causing more breakouts."
72,How is cystic acne treated?,"Over-the-counter medicines that work on milder acne often have little effect on cystic acne. A dermatologist will likely recommend one or more of the following: Oral antibiotics help control bacteria and lower inflammation. Sometimes your acne may not respond to antibiotics, though. Or you may find they don't work as well after a few years. Birth-control pills help some women by regulating their hormones. Prescription-strength creams, lotions, or gels with retinoid, a form of vitamin A, can help unplug your pores and help antibiotics do their job. Isotretinoin (formally known as Accutane but now available as the brands Claravis, Sotret, Myorisan, Amnesteem, and Absorica) attacks all causes of acne. The recommended dosage for most of these medications is to take a pill once or twice daily for about 5 months. For most people, this clears the skin completely and permanently. If it recurs, you can repeat the treatment. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this drug. Spironolactone is a medication that helps you get rid of unneeded water, but also is effective for cystic acne in women."
72,Who can get cystic acne and where does it appear?,"But it can strike someone as young as 8 or as old as 50. Your face, chest, back, upper arms, or shoulders can be affected. Severe cystic acne is more common in men, but women get it, too. Women often have cysts on the lower half of the face."
72,What should I know about cystic acne?,"But if you have large, red, and painful breakouts deep in your skin, it could mean you've developed something called cystic acne. These breakouts can be treated. Don't try to wait them out. Cystic acne can linger for years. It can affect large areas of your skin and leave permanent scars. A dermatologist can help you with a treatment plan."
72,How can I treat cystic acne at home?,"See More: Birth Control for Acne Don't touch cysts or pick at these blemishes. You may push the infection deeper and make it spread. Try to relax. Stress can cause your body to release more hormones, which can make acne worse. Follow a healthy lifestyle. Get plenty of sleep and exercise. Some research suggests that a low-glycemic diet, which limits sugar, can help symptoms."
72,What causes cystic acne?,"When you're a teenager, androgens increase. This leads to changes in your skin that can result in clogged pores and acne. In women, hormone changes can be brought on by menstrual cycles, pregnancy, menopause, or a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome. If one of your parents had severe cystic acne, you have a greater chance of getting it. Spironolactone is a medication that helps you get rid of unneeded water, but also is effective for cystic acne in women."
73,What does a differential diagnosis mean for food allergies?,"A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. When you go to the doctor's office and say, "" I think I have a food allergy,"" they have to consider a list of other things that could cause similar symptoms and be confused with a food allergy."
73,Which food allergies are most common?,"In adults, they include: Peanuts Tree nuts, such as walnuts Shellfish, including shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab For children, the food allergens that most often cause problems are: Eggs Milk Peanuts Adults usually don't lose their allergies, but children do sometimes. Kids are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, and soy than to peanuts, fish, and shrimp. The foods that you'll react to are often those that you eat regularly. In Japan, for example, you'll find rice allergy. In Scandinavia, codfish allergy is common."
73,How can food intolerances be tied to psychological triggers?,"Some people may have a food intolerance with a psychological trigger. An unpleasant event, often during childhood, that's tied to eating a particular food can bring on a rush of unpleasant sensations when you eat that food later, even as an adult."
73,How are patients with severe food allergies treated?,"Even people who are very careful can make a mistake, so if you have severe food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine ( Adrenaclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room."
73,What are sensitive food allergies like?,"For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to."
73,What are the benefits of breastfeeding relative to food allergies?,"Doctors recommend only breastfeeding infants for the first 4-6 months, if possible, for many reasons, but there's no proof that it prevents food allergies later in life. While some pregnant women may hope limiting their diets while they're pregnant or breastfeeding may help their children avoid allergies, the experts disagree and don't suggest it. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either."
73,Can food allergies cause certain disorders?,"Although some people think certain illnesses can be caused by food allergies, evidence doesn't back up such claims. Histamines in cheese or red wine, for example, can trigger migraines. But we can't say that food allergies actually cause migraines. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis aren't made worse by foods. Food allergies don't cause ""allergic tension fatigue syndrome,"" where people get tired, nervous, and may have problems concentrating or headaches."
73,What are food allergens?,"And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body."
73,How is a sublingual provocative challenge used to diagnose food allergies?,"You may feel itching in your mouth. Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."" Sublingual or subcutaneous provocative challenge. It's similar to a skin test, but the sample of food allergen goes under your tongue or gets injected under your skin."
73,What should I know about food allergies or food intolerances?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and think they have a food allergy. A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. With a food intolerance, your immune system isn't responsible. For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly because of lactose intolerance. A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them."
73,What are non-approved treatments for food allergies?,"The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of Ig E for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. You regularly get small amounts of food extracts over a long period of time to help your body build up a kind of tolerance. But researchers haven't yet proven that allergy shots work for food allergies."
73,When is an immune complex assay used to diagnose food allergies?,"When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies. Immune complex assay. But these clusters normally form as part of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them."
73,How do food allergies work?,"Some people come from families where allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies, but perhaps hay fever, asthma, or hives. When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies. Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E ( Ig E), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood. The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of Ig E for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The Ig E gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that Ig E and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction."
73,What medications do doctors use to treat food allergies?,"Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. Medications can help relieve food allergy symptoms that aren't part of an anaphylactic reaction: Antihistamines for digestive issues, hives, and sneezing and a runny nose Bronchodilators for tightened airways or asthma-like symptoms But these won't prevent an allergic reaction if you take them before eating the food. No medication can."
73,What is an exercise-induced food allergy?,"As your body temperature goes up, you'll begin to itch, get lightheaded, and could have hives or even anaphylaxis. Fortunately, the cure is simple: Don't eat that food for a couple of hours before you work out. How much did you eat before the reaction started?"
73,How is cytotoxicity testing used to diagnose food allergies?,"So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food. A food allergen is added to your blood sample. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."""
73,What are some common food allergies in children?,"A food challenge, or feeding test, is another way to confirm or rule out an allergy. Milk and soy allergies are particularly common in infants and young children, probably because their immune and digestive systems are still developing. These allergies can appear within days to months of birth. They may not show up as hives and asthma, but rather lead to colic and perhaps blood in poop or poor growth. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula."
73,Can food allergies cause hyperactivity in children?,"In the lungs, they may cause wheezing. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them. A food allergy won't directly affect a child's behavior, although their symptoms might make them cranky and difficult, and allergy medications can make them sleepy."
73,How is a skin puncture test used to diagnose food allergies?,"A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response. One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness."
73,What is a controversial food allergy treatment?,"This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. Putting a dilute solution of a food under your tongue about a half hour before you eat it as a way to ""neutralize"" your exposure doesn't work either."
73,How is the IgG subclass assay used to diagnose food allergies?,Ig G subclass assay. No medication can.
73,What affects food-related allergic reactions?,"The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure. As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years."
73,How is a double-blind food challenge done to diagnose food allergies?,"Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. The digestion process affects the timing and the location. But sulfites are still used in some foods. Then you try eating that food again to see if the symptoms come back, which confirms the diagnosis. In a ""double-blind"" test, neither you or your doctor know if what you're eating has the allergen in it. This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. It's also expensive because it takes a lot of time. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."""
73,How are milk allergies treated in babies?,"Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. Gluten intolerance is related to celiac disease. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either."
74,What are the risk factors for restless legs syndrome (RLS)?,"Other medical conditions linked to RLS include: Parkinson's disease Varicose veins Some tumors Fibromyalgia Hyper- or hypothyroidism (over- or underactive thyroid glands) Pregnancy Cigarette smoking Vitamin and mineral deficiency, such as magnesium deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency Severe kidney disease and uremia (kidney failure causing build up of toxins within the body) Amyloidosis (build-up of a starch-like substance in the body's tissues and organs) Lyme disease Damage to spinal nerves Rheumatoid arthritis and SjÃ¶gren syndrome Certain medications or substances, such as: Alcohol Caffeine Anticonvulsant drugs (such as Dilantin) Antidepressant drugs (including amitriptyline, Paxil) Beta-blockers (drugs often used to treat high blood pressure) Antipsychotics Withdrawal from certain drugs, such as vasodilator drugs (for example, Apresoline), sedatives, or antidepressants (for example, Tofranil) In many cases, RLS seems to run in families. People with a genetic link to RLS tend to get the condition earlier in life."
74,What medical conditions have been linked to restless legs syndrome (RLS)?,"Many different medical conditions have been linked to RLS. The two most common conditions are iron-deficiency anemia (low blood count) and peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves of the arms and legs, often caused by underlying conditions such as diabetes)."
74,What other medical conditions have been linked to restless legs syndrome (RLS)?,"Many different medical conditions have been linked to RLS. The two most common conditions are iron-deficiency anemia (low blood count) and peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves of the arms and legs, often caused by underlying conditions such as diabetes).

75,How should I protect my eye if I have an eye sore?,"If the person wears contact lenses, take them out. Dark glasses may provide comfort. Do not flush, patch, rub, dab at, or place compresses on the eye."
75,What happens when I go to the doctor for my eyesore?,"The health care provider will examine the eye and test vision. Depending on the age of the person, the health care provider may also check the pressure within the eye and perform other tests. Depending on the cause, the health care provider may prescribe eye drops or oral medicines or both and may recommend consultation from an ophthalmologist (eye specialist). Follow up depends on the cause of pain but may require a visit to an ophthalmologist."
75,When should I see a doctor about my eye sore?,"See a health care provider for persistent pain, eye redness, change in vision, drainage from the eye, rashes around the eye, swelling of the eyelids, or fever."
76,Can radiation therapy cause hypothyroidism?,This can damage cells that make thyroid hormone. You might get treated with radiation for: Overactive thyroid gland Cancer of the head or neck Hodgkin's disease or lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system) A bacterial or viral infection can make your thyroid gland swell.
76,What can keep your thyroid gland from making the right amount of thyroid hormone?,You can get hypothyroidism if you've had a procedure to remove part or all of your thyroid gland.
76,How can Hashimoto's disease cause your low thyroid levels?,"It's an autoimmune disease. If you have one, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells. If you have Hashimoto's disease, it destroys the cells that make thyroid hormone. This is congenital hypothyroidism."
77,What are some other causes of hypothermia?,The risk of cold exposure increases as the winter months arrive.
77,Who is at risk for hypothermia?,"People at increased risk for hypothermia include: The elderly, infants, and children without adequate heating, clothing, or food People with mental illness People who are outdoors for extended periods People in cold weather whose judgment is impaired by alcohol or drugs Recognizing the symptoms is the first step in diagnosing hypothermia."
77,How does cold exposure cause hypothermia?,"During exposure to cold temperatures, most heat loss -- up to 90% -- escapes through your skin; the rest, you exhale from your lungs. Heat loss through the skin happens primarily through radiation and speeds up when skin is exposed to wind or moisture. If cold exposure is due to being immersed in cold water, heat loss can occur 25 times faster than it would if exposed to the same air temperature. The hypothalamus, the brain's temperature-control center, works to raise body temperature by triggering processes that heat and cool the body. During cold temperature exposure, shivering is a protective response to produce heat through muscle activity. In another heat-preserving response -- called vasoconstriction -- blood vessels temporarily narrow. Normally, the activity of the heart and liver produce most of your body heat. But as core body temperature cools, these organs produce less heat, in essence causing a protective ""shut down"" to preserve heat and protect the brain. Low body temperature can slow brain activity, breathing, and heart rate. Confusion and fatigue can set in, hampering a person's ability to understand what's happening and make intelligent choices to get to safety."
78,What are the symptoms of uremia (uremic syndrome)?,"As waste and fluid build up in your blood, you might: Feel nauseated Feel itchy Lose your appetite or taste for some foods Feel more tired than usual Lose weight Have trouble concentrating Feel pain, numbness, or cramps in your legs or feet (caused by damage to your nerves) If it's not treated, uremia can also cause other problems, like: High blood pressure Anemia (when you don't have enough red blood cells) Heart disease Brain damage If your doctor thinks you might have uremia, he may recommend that you see a kidney specialist, called a nephrologist."
78,What problems may arise from untreated uremia (uremic syndrome)?,"As waste and fluid build up in your blood, you might: Feel nauseated Feel itchy Lose your appetite or taste for some foods Feel more tired than usual Lose weight Have trouble concentrating Feel pain, numbness, or cramps in your legs or feet (caused by damage to your nerves) If it's not treated, uremia can also cause other problems, like: High blood pressure Anemia (when you don't have enough red blood cells) Heart disease Brain damage If your doctor thinks you might have uremia, he may recommend that you see a kidney specialist, called a nephrologist."
78,What is the treatment for uremia (uremic syndrome)?,"If your kidneys are damaged to the point that they're failing, you may need help getting waste out of your blood. One option is a process called dialysis. It usually involves pumping your blood through a machine that cleans it and sends it back into your body. About 10% of people who need dialysis use a different kind, called peritoneal dialysis. With this, the space around the organs in your belly is filled with a fluid that draws wastes out. The fluid is then drained out through a tube in your belly. It can take more than 3 years to get a transplant."
79,What is the link between menopause and osteoporosis?,"Although the drop in estrogen levels during menopause can result in dramatically thinning of bone and increases your risk of osteoporosis, it isn't the sole cause of the disease. Many other factors -- like your genes, some diseases and treatments, eating disorders, excessive exercising and weight loss , smoking, excess alcohol, and deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D -- can play an important role. Remember that men can get osteoporosis too, even though they don't go through menopause."
79,How does vitamin D help prevent osteoporosis?,"The Institute of Medicine recommends: 600 IU (international units) a day for adults through age 70 800 IU a day for adults ages 70 and older Vitamin D plays a vital role in getting calcium into the bloodstream from the intestines and the kidneys. Without enough vitamin D, a lot of the calcium you take in from food or supplements could pass out of the body as waste."
79,How much calcium do I need to prevent osteoporosis?,"The amount of calcium you need depends on your age. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following: Adolescents should get 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day. Adults from 19 to 50 years of age should get 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. Adult women over the age of 50 should get 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. Adult men should receive 1,000 milligrams up to age 70 and 1,200 milligrams after age 70."
80,What should you consider when taking antihistamines?,"Some of the main side effects of antihistamines include: Dry mouth Drowsiness Dizziness Nausea and vomiting Restlessness or moodiness (in some children) Trouble peeing or not being able to pee Blurred vision Confusion If you take an antihistamine that causes drowsiness, do so before bedtime. Don't take it during the day before you drive or use machinery. Read the label before you take an allergy drug. Antihistamines may interact with other medications you are taking. Talk to your doctor first if you have an enlarged prostate, heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, kidney or liver disease, a bladder obstruction, or glaucoma. Also check with your doctor if you are pregnant or nursing."
81,Where can I find reliable information about alternative therapies for diabetes treatment?,"Look for scientific-based sources of information.

To learn more about alternative therapies for diabetes treatment, contact the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health."
81,What natural alternative therapies help with weight loss?,"Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight."
81,Are complementary or alternative medicines for diabetes effective?,"Although some may be effective, others aren't or can even be harmful. If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you."
81,What should you consider when deciding to use natural remedies for type 2 diabetes?,"You should talk to your doctor about any drugs, herbal products, or alternative and complementary treatments to make sure they're not going to interfere with your treatment or cause other problems. Beware of claims that seem too good to be true. Look for scientific-based sources of information. The National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse collects resource information for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK) Reference Collection, a service of the National Institutes of Health. To learn more about alternative therapies for diabetes treatment, contact the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health."
81,What is biofeedback?,Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques.
81,Does Coenzyme Q10 help with diabetes?,"Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control."
81,What is acupuncture for diabetes?,"Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes."
81,What is ephedrine?,"In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke."
81,What is guided imagery?,"Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition."
81,What should I do if alternative therapies for diabetes cause side effects?,"Stop taking the product and call your doctor right away if you: Feel queasy or throw up Have a fast heartbeat Feel more anxious, worried, or unsettled than usual Can't sleep Get diarrhea Get skin rashes"

81,Are all natural products okay for people with diabetes?,"You should talk to your doctor about any drugs, herbal products, or alternative and complementary treatments to make sure they're not going to interfere with your treatment or cause other problems. Select brands of natural products carefully -- ""natural"" doesn't automatically mean it's good for you. Avoid products made with more than one herb. Read labels: Look for the herb's common and scientific name, the name and address of the manufacturer, a batch and lot number, expiration date, dosage guidelines, and potential side effects."
81,"Are garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle scientifically proven to help with diabetes?","Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first."
81,Are alternative weight loss therapies effective?,"If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you. Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called ""obesity remedies"" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. Select brands of natural products carefully -- ""natural"" doesn't automatically mean it's good for you."
81,How does magnesium help with type 2 diabetes?,"Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes."
81,Does ginseng help with diabetes?,"Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first."
81,How does vanadium help with type 2 diabetes?,"Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages."
81,"What does ""alternative therapy"" mean for people with diabetes?","The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a ""group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine."" Complementary medicine is used with conventional treatments, whereas alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. To learn more about alternative therapies for diabetes treatment, contact the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health."
82,What causes night vision problems?,Not enough zinc.
82,How do you diagnose night vision problems?,A simple exam and conversation at an eye doctor's office can show the cause of your night blindness. The doctor will use drops to open your eyes up wide (he'll call this dilation).
82,What can you do about night vision problems?,What you can do for night blindness depends on the cause. Cataracts are removed surgically. The doctor will replace your clouded natural lens with a clear artificial model known as an intraocular lens. One treatment uses a laser to destroy the tiny blood vessels that threaten your vision. But it won't hurt to eat foods rich in these nutrients if you have trouble seeing at night.
83,What happens if heart failure is left untreated?,"Left untreated, heart failure worsens and may prevent the heart from pumping enough blood to keep the person alive."
83,How common is heart failure and how serious is it?,"About 5.8 million Americans have heart failure, which contributes to about 282,000 deaths each year. Although treatment of heart failure has led to improved survival rates, as many as ten percent of patients with mild heart failure and more than 50% of patients with more severe heart failure die annually. Heart failure is the single most frequent cause of hospitalization for Americans ages 65 and older."
83,What are the most common causes of heart failure?,"The most common causes of heart failure are: Coronary artery disease (narrowing or hardening of arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, usually caused by a buildup of fats and cholesterol) High blood pressure (hypertension) Many people with heart failure have both coronary artery disease and hypertension. Heart failure may also be caused by other conditions that weaken or interfere with the heart's function, including: Previous heart attack Heart valve disease Dysfunction of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Heart defects present at birth Infection of the heart valves or muscle (endocarditis or myocarditis) Diabetes Chronic kidney disease"
84,Who can get primary liver cancer?,"Children and adults can both get primary liver cancer, but it's more common when you're older. There are different types and many ways to treat it."
84,How is embolization therapy (reduced blood flow) used to treat liver cancer?,"Embolization therapy (reduced blood flow): Your liver gets blood from two blood vessels. Most normal liver cells get it from one blood vessel and cancer cells get it from the other. With embolization therapy, your doctor cuts off the blood flow to the cancer cells to kill the tumor."
84,How is chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer?,"Chemotherapy: This uses medications to treat cancer. For liver cancer, it's usually done with a pump placed in your body so the medicine goes right to your liver, not your whole body.

You'll also talk about your health history. Your doctor may then do: Blood tests to look for certain substances that could be signs of cancer Imaging, such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound to see how many tumors you have and where they are located A biopsy, where cells or tissues are removed to see if they're cancerous."
84,What is the most common type of liver cancer?,"Hepatocellular cancer ( HCC) is by far the most common type of cancer that starts in the liver. Most people who get it also have an ongoing (or âchronicâ) liver disease, such as cirrhosis. It's found more often in men than women."
84,What causes primary liver cancer?,"It's often not clear what causes liver cancer, but you may be more likely to get it if you have: Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV) or chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV) infection, both of which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer Cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis or years of heavy drinking Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease -- common with obese people, even if they don't drink Certain liver diseases, such as hemochromatosis (when your body absorbs too much iron) and Wilson's disease (when your body absorbs too much copper) Type 2 diabetes If you're very overweight or drink heavily for many years, you're more likely to get cirrhosis, which can make you more likely to get liver cancer. Also, if you've eaten foods with aflatoxins, you have a higher chance of getting this cancer. Aflatoxins are poisons made by a fungus that grows on some crops, such as corn and peanuts, when they aren't stored the right way."

86,How can you keep the cat litter box clean?,"1 rule, and the only thing that will keep litter box odor at bay, is constant cleaning. That means scooping the box out at least twice a day, removing the solids and liquid clumps if you use clumping litter. For those who don’t use clumping litter, use a large, solid metal spoon (such as a large kitchen spoon) to lift out the most urine-soaked areas each time you clean. Add litter as needed to replace what is removed. Also wash the box weekly, or every other week if you are using clumping litter. Use a mild, unscented dish detergent or a mild bleach spray (20 parts water to one part bleach) and rinse well. Clean your scooper also. When dry, add 2 to 3 inches of litter. Cats don’t like a deep tray of litter and this allows you to add litter as you scoop."
86,What types of cat litter box should you avoid?,"And avoid covered boxes. Most cats don’t like them, and they can trap odors inside, making it unpleasant for your pet to enter. Many cats also don’t like plastic liners, which can snare cat’s claws when they dig. This also allows urine to seep under the liner, where it won’t be absorbed by the litter and can cause odors. As for self-cleaning litter boxes, it depends. Some cats, especially skittish and large cats, may dislike them. But if your cat doesn’t mind, it’s an option for people who are gone for long periods."
86,How can you keep cat litter box smell fresher?,"No wonder studies have found that at least 10% of cats stop using their litter boxes reliably at some point. Many believe that clumping litters, which allow for the easy removal of solids and liquids, keep boxes smelling fresher. But cats can be very particular about which litters they will use. So experiment to find the litter your cat likes best, then stick with it. If a cat is on the third floor, and the box is in the basement, he may decide not to make the long trek."
86,Where should you put the cat litter box?,"Clean your scooper also. Don’t put a box in a small, enclosed area, like a tiny bathroom or closet, which will concentrate litter box odors. A larger, well-ventilated area is best. But it needs to be in a quiet, low-traffic area, away from your cat’s food, other pets, and anything that can startle or scare your cat while he’s using the box. Yes, it takes a daily effort on your part to keep litter box odors at bay. But the result will be a happier cat and a better-smelling home."
87,How can you avoid hotel germs when you travel?,"Health experts point out that most hotel rooms are better cleaned than most homes. Towels and sheets are changed daily, and the room is cleaned somewhat every day. Still, experts suggest wiping down remote controls, light switches, telephones, doorknobs, toilet seat handles, faucet handles, and other high-touch areas as a precaution when traveling with children."
87,How can you avoid germs on airplanes?,"Consider these measures if you're concerned about airplane germs: Sanitize ""high touch"" areas. Germs linger longer on nonporous materials like plastic. Wipe down surfaces such as tray tables, seat armrests, and lavatory door handles with an alcohol-based wipe or gel before your child uses them. Then use another paper towel to dry hands and open the door. If someone near you isn't covering coughs or sneezes, ask him to, even if it makes you feel awkward to do so. And be sure you do the same."
87,How can you help your child avoid swimming pool and water parks germs?,Swimming pools and water parks. Chlorination does not kill all bacteria. Also teach young children to avoid swallowing water in pools and water parks.
87,How can you avoid germs when traveling with children?,"If you are planning to travel with a newborn infant or a child with a compromised immune system, talk to your child's doctor first about special precautions. These three strategies can help protect them: Make sure your child is up to date on immunizations, even when traveling in the U. S. Be sure your child has had routine vaccinations for measles, whooping cough, and other serious illnesses on the normal CDC schedule. And anyone in your travel party who hasn't gotten a yearly flu shot should consider getting one before heading out. Washing hands often, especially before meals, is the No. Using warm soap and water, lather up and scrub all over for 20 seconds, then rinse and dry. While you're at it, encourage your kids not to put dirty hands -- or other things -- in their mouth. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer."

Weight-bearing exercise helps protect against osteoporosis. Your doctor or a physical therapist can work with you to create a fun, safe exercise program."
91,Why do hormones play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Some with rheumatoid arthritis find that menopause can affect their RA. Researchers aren't sure why, but hormones seem to play a role in RA. Nearly three times as many women get the disease as men. Many women who have it see their symptoms improve while they're pregnant. This may be because their estrogen levels go up during pregnancy."

It can help if both of you talk together with a doctor or counselor."
91,When do rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms worsen?,"Estrogen levels drop around the time of menopause. When that happens, RA symptoms may worsen. Some women first get symptoms around the time they start menopause. You might think that taking estrogen would reduce RA symptoms along with the symptoms of menopause, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And because hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) is linked with heart disease -- another increased risk for women with rheumatoid arthritis - doctors rarely recommend it for treating menopause symptoms in women with RA."

96,How are skin and arthritis conditions associated with hepatitis C?,"Skin and Arthritis Conditions and Hepatitis C Two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda, have been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. Porphyria cutanea tarda may resolve with successful interferon therapy for the hepatitis C virus. There have been cases, however, where lichen planus actually worsened during interferon treatment. In addition, many hepatitis C virus patients have autoimmune antibodies, such as anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. But true rheumatoid arthritis is uncommon in people with hepatitis C virus."
96,How is cryoglobulinemia relative to hepatitis C diagnosed?,"In this test, the cryoglobulins are identified when the blood sample is exposed to the cold (cryo means cold). In addition, a finding of typical inflammation of small blood vessels in certain tissue biopsies (for example, the skin or kidney) supports the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. Symptoms of cryoglobulinemia often resolve with successful treatment of the hepatitis C virus infection. B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hepatitis C B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph tissue, has also been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. The cause is thought to be the excessive stimulation by the hepatitis C virus of B-lymphocytes, which results in the abnormal reproduction of the lymphocytes."
96,How is B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated with hepatitis C?,"B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hepatitis C B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph tissue, has also been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus. The cause is thought to be the excessive stimulation by the hepatitis C virus of B-lymphocytes, which results in the abnormal reproduction of the lymphocytes. Interestingly, treatment with interferon therapy and some newer direct-acting antiviral treatments have caused some cases of hepatitis C virus-associated low-grade (not very active) non- Hodgkin's lymphoma to go into remission. However, most individuals with hepatitis C virus-associated high-grade non- Hodgkin's lymphoma will require the usual anti-cancer therapies."

98,How do foods fight cancer?,"People who eat more fruits and veggies tend to get less cancer. That may be because those foods are high in antioxidants -- chemicals that fight the cell damage that leads to cancer. You can find antioxidants in fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and other plant-based foods, as well as in supplements. But research suggests that getting them from food works better than getting them from pills. Some supplements may raise your risk of getting cancer."

Cancer experts say it's key to avoid high-calorie processed foods and sugary beverages like soda, sweet tea, and juice-flavored drinks. They have lots of calories but won't help you feel full. Alcohol is also tied to several types of cancer. All types -- beer, wine, and spirits -- seem to raise your chances. Drink in moderate amounts. That means no more than one drink a day for women, and no more than two for men."

This is a simple procedure. ( If the dermatologist thinks the mole might be cancerous, cutting through the mole will not cause the cancer to spread.) If the mole is found to be cancerous, the dermatologist will cut out the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area and a rim of normal skin around it, and stitching the wound closed."
99,What are the ABCDEs of examining moles?,"The following ABCDEs are important characteristics to consider when examining moles. If a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked immediately by a dermatologist. It could be cancerous. Asymmetry. One half of the mole does not match the other half. Border. The border or edges of the mole are ragged, blurred, or irregular. Color. The color of the mole is not the same throughout or has shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red. Diameter. The diameter of a mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil. Evolution. The mole is changing in size, shape, or color."

Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people."
99,What is dysplastic nevi mole?,"Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Any changes in a mole should be checked by a dermatologist to evaluate for skin cancer."
99,What are lentigines?,"A lentigo (plural: lentigines) is a spot on the skin that is darker (usually brown) than the surrounding skin. Lentigines are more common among whites, especially those with fair skin."
99,What is a congenital nevi mole?,Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people. These moles are slightly more likely to develop into melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below).
99,Can lentigines be prevented?,"There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing it off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat.

However, they can become irritated if anything, such as clothing, jewelry, or skin rubs against them. Your dermatologist can remove a skin tag by cutting it off with a scalpel or scissors, with cryosurgery (freezing it off), or with electrosurgery (burning it off with an electric current)."
99,What are common skin lesions?,"Freckles are extremely common and are not a health threat. They are more often seen in the summer, especially among lighter-skinned people and people with light or red hair. Causes of freckles include genetics and exposure to the sun."
99,What causes freckles?,Exposure to the sun seems to be the major cause of lentigines.
99,How do you know if a mole is cancer?,"The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 25. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, or become tender or painful."
99,How are seborrheic keratoses treated?,"Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and are not contagious. Therefore, they don't need to be treated. If you decide to have seborrheic keratoses removed because you don't like the way they look, or because they are chronically irritated by clothing, methods for removing them include cutting them off, cryosurgery, and electrosurgery."

Usually, infection comes after eating undercooked crab or crayfish that carry immature flukes. Once swallowed by a person, the worms mature and grow inside the body. Over months, the worms spread through the intestines and belly (abdomen). They penetrate the diaphragm muscle to enter the lungs. Once inside the lungs, the worms lay eggs and can survive for years, causing chronic (long-term) paragonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is rare in the U. S. Most cases occur in Asia, West Africa, and South and Central America."
102,How is paragonimiasis treated?,"In most people, paragonimiasis can be cured with oral anti-parasite medications. Both praziquantel ( Biltricide) and triclabendazole ( Egaten) are approved for treatment.

This causes organs like the uterus, the bladder, or the rectum to move from their normal places and herniate into the vagina. The vagina may also change shape. Pregnancy and giving birth may cause these kinds of problems. Symptoms you may have: Leaking urine Feeling like something is falling out of your vagina Difficulty with bowel movements Lower back pain Pain during sex Pelvic organs bulge into the vagina, or even stick out the vaginal opening, in severe cases Vulvodynia is pain that affects the vulva for no apparent reason."

It narrows your blood vessels, which can hurt your skin, kidneys, heart, brain, and nervous system. Your doctor may call Fabry disease a ""storage disorder."" It usually starts in childhood and is much more common in men than women. That's because the symptoms are common and can affect so many different parts of the body."
108,What tests do you need when you have Fabry disease?,"You can also expect to get regular tests to keep track of how you're doing. These may include: Blood, urine, and thyroid tests EKG (electrocardiogram). CT of your head."
108,How is Fabry disease treated?,"The most common has been enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT) which replaces the enzyme that is missing or not working correctly. This allows your body to break down fatty also substances the way it should. You will probably visit an outpatient center every few weeks to get the enzyme injected into a vein. Your doctor may recommend that you also take: Drugs to relieve pain (prescription or nonprescription) Medicine for stomach problems Blood thinners or other drugs for irregular heartbeat or other heart problems Blood pressure medicine, which also helps protect your kidneys You may need dialysis or a kidney transplant if Fabry disease has caused serious kidney damage."

109,What is a hip (acetabular) labral tear?,"In others it causes pain in the groin. It can make you feel like your leg is ""catching"" or ""clicking"" in the socket as you move it. Over time, labral tears in the hip may cause permanent damage to the joint. The labrum is a band of tough cartilage and connective tissue that lines the rim of the hip socket, or acetabulum."
109,Who is most likely to get a labrum tear in their hip?,"Labral tears of the hip are more common in women. They also occur more often in people who have abnormalities of the hip structure, like hip dysplasia and other conditions. In recent years, experts have found that acetabular labral tears are much more common than once thought. Studies show that up to 22% of athletes who complain of groin pain have a labral tear in the hip."
110,Who is at the greatest risk for complications of the flu?,"While anyone can get flu, infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with chronic ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and HIV are at highest risk for flu complications. Despite advances in flu prevention and treatment, the CDC estimates that deaths related to influenza range from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths in the United States each year."
110,Which flu strains are linked to Reye's syndrome?,"Widespread outbreaks of Reye's syndrome have occurred with influenza type B and also with chickenpox, but other viruses have been implicated. The risk of Reye's syndrome is increased when taking aspirin, so anyone under age 18 should not take aspirin if they have any viral symptoms or are recovering from the flu or any other virus."
110,What is avian or bird flu?,"Bird flu, or avian influenza, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. Bird flu epidemics have occurred worldwide. Bird flu is a leading contender to be the next pandemic flu bug because it has caused an unprecedented epidemic in poultry and wild birds across Asia and Eastern Europe. Still, no one knows for sure whether this will cause the next human flu pandemic."
110,How many different types of colds and flus are there and how are they treated?,"More than 100 types of cold viruses are known, and new strains of flu evolve every few years. Since both diseases are viral, antibiotics cannot conquer cold or flu. Remember: Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections."
110,How is the flu prevented?,"Specific strains of flu can be prevented by a flu vaccine, either a flu shot or nasal spray flu vaccine. In addition, antiviral medications are available to prevent flu. These drugs may help reduce the severity and the duration of flu and are best used within the first 48 hours of the appearance of flu symptoms."
110,Where do influenza viruses originate and how do they mutate?,"Most influenza viruses that infect humans seem to originate in parts of Asia, where close contact between livestock and people creates a hospitable environment for mutation and transmission of viruses. Swine, or pigs, can catch both avian (meaning from birds, such as poultry) and human forms of a virus and act as hosts for these different viral strains to meet and mutate into new forms. The swine then transmit the new form of the virus to people in the same way in which people infect each other -- by transmitting viruses through droplets in the air that people breathe in."
110,Can antiviral or antibiotic medications treat the flu or a cold?,"But there are no medications that specifically defeat the common cold. Antibiotics may be helpful only if there is a secondary bacterial infection. In addition, antiviral medications are available to prevent flu."
110,What are the differences in symptoms of a cold and the flu?,"Both cold and flu may bring coughing, headache, and chest discomfort. With the flu, though, you are likely to run a high fever for several days and have body aches, fatigue, and weakness. Symptoms of the flu also tend to come on abruptly. Usually, complications from colds are relatively minor, but a case of flu can lead to a life-threatening illness such as pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of stomach flu."
111,What cold and flu medicines can help me with a headache or body aches?,"Headache or body aches: Choose a pain reliever that contains acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. If you take one of these, look at any other medicines you're taking to make sure they don't contain the same drug. Many cold and flu treatments have the same ingredients."
111,What cold and flu medicines can help me with sore throat?,"Sore throat: Use throat lozenges or cough drops to soothe your sore throat. Or try a pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen."

111,What cold and flu medicines can help me with stuffy nose?,"Stuffy nose: Look for decongestant pills that contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine. Decongestants help a stuffy nose by shrinking swollen nasal passages that cause congestion. You can also try decongestant nose drops or sprays, but you should not use these products for more than 3 days. Saline (saltwater) nose sprays or rinses can also help relieve congestion and break up mucus. These sprays are safe to use as often as you want."
111,Can children take over-the-counter cold and flu medicines?,"A whole aisle of over-the-counter cold and flu medicines awaits you at the store.

112,Why do I need to take medicine after a heart attack?,"Limit plaques by lowering cholesterol. Other drugs may be prescribed if needed. These include medications to treat irregular heartbeats, lower blood pressure, control chest pain, and treat heart failure."
112,"What are the symptoms of a heart attack, and how long will they last?","Symptoms of a heart attack include: Discomfort, pressure, heaviness, or pain in the chest, arm or below the breastbone Discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat or arm Fullness, indigestion or choking feeling (may feel like heartburn) Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness Extreme weakness, anxiety or shortness of breath Rapid or irregular heartbeats Fatigue During a heart attack, symptoms may last 30 minutes or longer and are not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Some people have a heart attack without having any symptoms (a ""silent"" myocardial infarction). A silent MI can occur in anyone, though it is more common among diabetics."
112,"After a heart attack, when should I see my doctor after I leave the hospital?","Make a doctor's appointment for two to six weeks after leaving the hospital. Your doctor will want to check the progress of your recovery. She may ask you to undergo diagnostic tests (such as an exercise stress test or echocardiogram at regular intervals). These tests can help your doctor diagnose the presence or progression of blockages in your coronary arteries and plan treatment. Call your doctor sooner if you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath -- especially at rest, dizziness, or irregular heartbeats."
112,Iâve had a heart attack. How can I prevent another one?,"The goal after a heart attack is to keep the heart healthy and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. Your best opportunities to ward off future attacks is to take your medications, change your lifestyle, and see your doctor for regular heart checkups."
112,"Whatâs the purpose of drugs that treat a heart attack, and when should they be given?","The goals of drug therapy are to break up or prevent blood clots, prevent platelets from gathering and sticking to the plaque, stabilize the plaque, and prevent further damage. These medications must be given as soon as possible to decrease the amount of heart damage. The longer the delay in starting these drugs, the more damage can occur and the less benefit they can provide."
112,How can an artery spasm bring on a heart attack?,"While it is unusual, a heart attack can also be caused by a spasm of a coronary artery. Coronary arteries have a muscle lining which can contract or relax depending on the needs of the heart muscle at a given time. During a coronary spasm, the coronary arteries constrict or spasm without warning, reducing blood supply to the heart muscle and potentially causing a heart attack. The amount of damage to the heart muscle depends on the size of the area supplied by the blocked artery and the time between injury and treatment. Earlier treatment can reduce the impact of the heart attack."
112,How can a blocked artery bring on a heart attack?,"Heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to nourish it. Fatty matter, calcium, proteins and inflammatory cells build up within the arteries to form plaques of different sizes and consistencies. With the build-up of plaque, there is less delivery of oxygen to the heart muscle, especially when there is a demand for oxygen (during exertion or exercise) and chest pain or symptoms can develop. The outer surface of the plaque may rupture or crack and platelets (disc-shaped particles in the blood that help form blood clots) then come to the area to form blood clots around the plaque -- like a scab. If a blood clot totally obstructs the artery, the heart muscle can become starved for oxygen. This is called ischemia."
112,What tests are used to diagnose a heart attack?,"The electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG) can provide information about the extent and location of heart muscle damage. Blood may be drawn to measure levels of cardiac enzymes that indicate heart muscle damage. By measuring the levels of these enzymes, the doctor can determine approximately when the heart attack started. An echocardiogram (also called an echo) is an ultrasound test that can be used to learn how the heart is pumping overall and what areas might not be pumping normally. Cardiac catheterization."
113,What are the symptoms of stomach cancer from H. pylori?,"Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms: Stool that is bloody, dark red, or black Trouble breathing Dizziness or fainting Feeling very tired for no reason Pale skin color Vomit that has blood or looks like coffee grounds Severe, sharp stomach pain It's not common, but H. pylori infection can cause stomach cancer. The disease has few symptoms at first, such as heartburn. Over time, you may notice: Belly pain or swelling Nausea Not feeling hungry Feeling full after you eat just a small amount Vomiting Weight loss for no reason If you don't have symptoms of an ulcer, your doctor probably won't test you for H. pylori."
113,When should you get tested for H. pylori infection?,"But if you have them now or have in the past, it's best to get tested. Medicines like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) can also damage your stomach lining, so it's important to find out what's causing your symptoms so you can get the right treatment."
113,How is a computed tomography (CT) scan used to diagnose H. pylori infection?,It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body.
113,How long do treatments for H. pylori infections last?,"Your treatment could mean you'll take 14 or more pills per day for a few weeks, which seems like a lot of medicine. But it's really important to take everything that your doctor prescribes and to follow her instructions. If you don't take antibiotics the right way, bacteria in your body can become resistant to them, which makes infections harder to treat. If your medications bother you, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and how you can handle side effects. About 1-2 weeks after you finish your treatment, your doctor may test your breath or stool again to make sure the infection is gone."
113,When should you call your doctor about symptoms of an ulcer from H. pylori?,"Other signs of an ulcer include: Bloating Burping Not feeling hungry Nausea Vomiting Weight loss for no clear reason Ulcers can bleed into your stomach or intestines, which can be dangerous to your health. Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms: Stool that is bloody, dark red, or black Trouble breathing Dizziness or fainting Feeling very tired for no reason Pale skin color Vomit that has blood or looks like coffee grounds Severe, sharp stomach pain It's not common, but H. pylori infection can cause stomach cancer."
113,How is an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy used to diagnose H. pylori infection?,"In a hospital, a doctor will use a tube with a small camera, called an endoscope, to look down your throat and into your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine. The procedure may also be used to collect a sample that will be examined for the presence of the bacteria. You may be asleep or awake during the procedure, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable."
113,How can you prevent H. pylori infection?,"You can protect yourself from getting an H. pylori infection with the same steps you take to keep other germs at bay: Wash your hands after you use the bathroom and before you prepare or eat food. Teach your children to do the same. Avoid food or water that's not clean. Don't eat anything that isn't cooked thoroughly. Avoid food served by people who haven't washed their hands. Though stress, spicy foods, alcohol, and smoking don't cause ulcers, they can keep them from healing quickly or make your pain worse. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage your stress, improve your diet, and, if you smoke, how you can get help to quit."
113,How is H. pylori infection diagnosed?,"To start, your doctor will ask you about your medical history, your symptoms, and any medicines you take. Then she'll give you a physical exam, including pressing on your belly to check for swelling, tenderness, or pain. You may also have: Tests of your blood and stool, which can help find an infection Urea breath test. You'll drink a special liquid that has a substance called urea. Then you'll breathe into a bag, which your doctor will send to a lab for testing. If you have H. pylori, the bacteria will change the urea in your body into carbon dioxide, and lab tests will show that your breath has higher than normal levels of the gas."
113,How does H. pylori make you sick?,"For decades, doctors thought people got ulcers from stress, spicy foods, smoking, or other lifestyle habits."
113,Who can get H. pylori infection?,"Many people get H. pylori during childhood, but adults can get it, too. The germs live in the body for years before symptoms start, but most people who have it will never get ulcers. Doctors aren't sure why only some people get ulcers after an infection."
113,Where can I find information or support for H. pylori infection?,"For some people, an infection can lead to stomach cancer. You may also have: Tests of your blood and stool, which can help find an infection Urea breath test."
113,What can I expect after H. pylori infection?,"Tests that make detailed pictures of the insides of your body, such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) If you have ulcers caused by H. pylori, you'll need treatment to kill the germs, heal your stomach lining, and keep the sores from coming back. If you've had one, you should avoid taking NSAIDs for pain, since these drugs can damage your stomach lining. If you need pain medicine, ask your doctor to recommend some."
113,How are upper GI tests used to diagnose H. pylori infection?,"You'll drink a special liquid that has a substance called urea. In a hospital, a doctor will use a tube with a small camera, called an endoscope, to look down your throat and into your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine."
113,What is H. pylori?,"These germs can enter your body and live in your digestive tract. After many years, they can cause sores, called ulcers, in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of your small intestine. For some people, an infection can lead to stomach cancer. Most ulcers caused by H. pylori will heal after a few weeks of treatment."
113,How common are infections from H. pylori?,"Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori) is a type of bacteria. As more of the world gets access to clean water and sanitation, fewer people than before are getting the bacteria. With good health habits, you can protect yourself and your children from H. pylori. The germs live in the body for years before symptoms start, but most people who have it will never get ulcers. Tests that make detailed pictures of the insides of your body, such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) If you have ulcers caused by H. pylori, you'll need treatment to kill the germs, heal your stomach lining, and keep the sores from coming back."
113,How does H. pylori affect your body?,"After H. pylori enters your body, it attacks the lining of your stomach, which usually protects you from the acid your body uses to digest food. These may bleed, cause infections, or keep food from moving through your digestive tract. Tests that make detailed pictures of the insides of your body, such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) If you have ulcers caused by H. pylori, you'll need treatment to kill the germs, heal your stomach lining, and keep the sores from coming back."
114,What is the most common type of diabetic eye disease?,"Diabetic retinopathy is the most common type of diabetic eye disease. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to have some degree of diabetic retinopathy. How bad it will be depends on how well you control your blood sugar."
114,What is background or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)?,Background or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR): This is the earliest stage. Damaged blood vessels begin to leak into the retina.
114,What is macular edema?,"NPDR can cause changes in the eye including: Macular edema: Blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula and it swells. Located in the center of your retina, it's what gives you your pinpoint vision. This won't lead to blindness, but it can cause blurred vision. It can get better once you get your blood sugar and blood pressure under control. If it doesn't improve, lasers or medications injected directly into your eye may help."
114,What are cataracts and glaucoma?,"Cataracts, when the eye's lens clouds up, are a common cause of vision loss and a normal part of the aging process. Glaucoma, a disease that damages your optic nerve, is a leading cause of blindness for people over 60."
114,How often should I get a dilated eye exam if I have diabetes?,"If you have diabetes, get a dilated exam as soon as you're diagnosed. Your doctor will put drops in your eye to widen the pupil. That lets him get a better look at your retina and optic nerve. Adults with type 2 diabetes should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Your eye doctor will let you know if you need to come in more often. Let him know if you notice sudden vision changes. Blurry vision can result from blood sugar that's too high or too low."
114,Am I more at risk for cataracts and glaucoma if I have diabetes?,"They're not specific to diabetes, but they can show up earlier if you have it. It all depends on how well you control your blood sugar. And they're just two more reasons you need to work closely with your doctor to keep the disease under control."
114,What is macular ischemia?,Macular ischemia: This loss of blood flow results when small blood vessels in your retina close up. Your vision blurs because the macula no longer gets enough blood to work like it should.
114,How does having high blood sugar cause vision problems?,This thin layer of light-sensitive tissue lines the back of the eye and sends light to your brain. That's what allows you to see. NPDR can cause changes in the eye including: Macular edema: Blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula and it swells.
115,Can immune system problems cause achy joints?,"When the lining inside your joints becomes inflamed, the area around them is tender to the touch. It might also be stiff or swollen, and it can happen with more than one joint. You may notice that it's worse in the morning."
115,Can immune system problems cause dry eyes?,"If you have an autoimmune disorder, that means your immune system attacks your body instead of defending it. Rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are two examples. Many people who have an autoimmune disorder find that they have dry eyes. You might feel a sandy, gritty feeling like something is in your eye. Or you may notice pain, redness, a stringy discharge, or blurred vision. Some people find they can't cry even when they're upset."
115,Can immune system problems lead to infections?,"Other red flags: Chronic sinus infections, being sick with more than four ear infections in a year (for anyone over the age of 4), or having pneumonia more than once."
115,Can immune system problems cause tingling or numbness in your hands and feet?,"It can be completely innocent. But in some cases it can mean that your body is attacking nerves that send signals to your muscles. People who have Guillain- Barre syndrome, for instance, may have numbness that starts in their legs then moves up to their arms and chest. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( CIDP) has symptoms similar to the demyelinating form of GBS (called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or AIDP), but while GBS lasts two weeks to 30 days."
115,What can happen if your immune system is working too hard?,"If it kicks into action too often, you may get a condition like allergies, asthma, or eczema. Or if your immune system starts to attack your body instead of safeguarding it, you could have an autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes."
115,Can immune system problems cause weight change?,You find yourself gaining extra pounds even though your eating habits and workouts haven't changed.
115,Can immune system problems cause a fever?,"If you're running a higher temperature than normal, it could be that your immune system is starting to overwork. That can happen due to an oncoming infection or because you're starting to have a flare of an autoimmune condition."
115,Can immune system problems cause swallowing issues?,"If you have a tough time getting food down, your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach) could be swollen or too weak to work well. Some people feel like food is stuck in their throat or chest. Others gag or choke when they swallow. One of the possible causes can be a problem with your immune system."
115,Can immune system problems cause bathroom problems?,"Diarrhea that lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks can be a warning sign that your immune system is harming the lining of your small intestine or digestive tract. Constipation is a concern, too. If your bowel movements are hard to pass, very firm, or look like they're made up of small rabbit pellets, your immune system may be forcing your intestine to slow down. Other possible causes include bacteria, viruses, and other health conditions."
115,Can immune system problems cause headaches?,"In some cases, headaches can be related to the immune system. For example, it could be vasculitis, which is inflammation of a blood vessel caused by an infection or autoimmune disease."
115,Can immune system problems cause fatigue?,"Keep in mind that these possible clues can happen for many other reasons. You might feel a sandy, gritty feeling like something is in your eye. But in some cases it can mean that your body is attacking nerves that send signals to your muscles."
115,Could my illness be related to immune system problems?,"They can all cause inflammation. But do you know the other warning signs? Keep in mind that these possible clues can happen for many other reasons. To figure out what's going on with your health, you'll want to see your doctor. For example, it could be vasculitis, which is inflammation of a blood vessel caused by an infection or autoimmune disease."
115,Can immune system problems cause hair loss?,"If you lose hair on your scalp, face, or other parts of your body, you could have a condition called alopecia areata. Strands or clumps of hair coming out can also be a symptom of lupus. Sometimes your immune system decides to fight the skin's pigment-making cells, called melanocytes."
115,Can immune system problems cause white patches on the skin?,"To figure out what's going on with your health, you'll want to see your doctor. Sometimes the immune system attacks hair follicles."
115,Can immune system problems cause cold hands?,"The skin in these areas may turn white, then blue, when you're exposed to the cold. Once blood flow returns, the skin may then turn red. Doctors call this â Raynaud's phenomenon.â Immune system problems can cause it, but so can other things, including smoking, some prescription drugs, and conditions that affect your arteries. If your bowel movements are hard to pass, very firm, or look like they're made up of small rabbit pellets, your immune system may be forcing your intestine to slow down."
115,Can immune system problems cause rashes?,"People with lupus often get a butterfly-shaped rash across their nose and cheeks. Strands or clumps of hair coming out can also be a symptom of lupus. If so, you'll start to see white patches of skin on your body. Called jaundice, it may mean that your immune system is attacking and destroying healthy liver cells."
116,What does yellow poop mean?,"This shade is also normal for many people. It's common for babies, especially those who breastfeed. But if you have yellow poop that looks greasy and smells very bad, it may have too much fat. That could be a sign your body isn't digesting food properly. For example, if you have celiac disease, your body can't handle a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, barley, and rye. If you have the condition and eat foods that have gluten, like many breads, pastas, and cookies, your intestines won't work as they should. There may be other causes of yellow poop that's greasy and smelly. If it happens to you often, tell your doctor."

117,What initial tests are used for childhood leukemia?,"Initial tests may include: Blood tests to measure the number of blood cells and see how they appear Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, usually taken from the pelvic bone, to confirm a diagnosis of leukemia Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to check for spread of leukemia cells in the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord A pathologist examines cells from the blood tests under a microscope."
117,What does treatment for childhood leukemia involve?,"Before cancer treatment begins, sometimes a child needs treatment to address illness complications. For example, changes in blood cells can lead to infections or severe bleeding and may affect the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. Treatment may involve antibiotics, blood transfusions, or other measures to fight infection."
117,How does a pathologist diagnose childhood leukemia?,"Initial tests may include: Blood tests to measure the number of blood cells and see how they appear Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, usually taken from the pelvic bone, to confirm a diagnosis of leukemia Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to check for spread of leukemia cells in the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord A pathologist examines cells from the blood tests under a microscope.

CLL is very rare in children. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML). This is a rare type that is neither chronic nor acute and happens most often in children under age 4.
117,How is a stem cell transplant used for childhood leukemia?,"If standard treatment is likely to be less effective, a stem cell transplant may be the best option. It involves a transplant of blood-forming stem cells after whole body radiation combined with high-dose chemotherapy happens first to destroy the child's bone marrow."
117,How do children get leukemia?,"But certain things may raise the chances of getting it. Keep in mind, though, that having one of these things does not necessarily mean a child will get leukemia.

117,What is the outlook for childhood leukemia?,"AML is the next most common type of childhood leukemia. And treatment at special centers for children and teens has the advantages of specialized care. Childhood cancers tend to respond to treatment better than adult cancers do, and children's bodies often tolerate treatment better."
117,What is childhood leukemia?,"Childhood leukemia, the most common type of cancer in children and teens, is a cancer of the white blood cells. As tough as it is for a child to have cancer, it's good to know that most children and teens with childhood leukemia can be successfully treated.

Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. He may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements."
119,When should you get surgery to remove your entire colon if you have ulcerative colitis?,"Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. He attaches a bag there and brings the tip of your lower small intestine through the opening. Waste passes through it and collects in a pouch, which gets attached to the stoma. You'd need to wear the pouch all the time."

Other signs may include: A rash or dry skin Brownish discoloration A foul-smelling fluid oozing from the sore An ulcer can also become infected."
120,What are the causes of venous skin ulcer?,"A venous skin ulcer is a sore on your leg that's very slow to heal, usually because of weak blood circulation in the limb. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That's often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren't working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal."
120,How do you prevent venous skin ulcers?,"But there are steps you can take to prevent them from happening. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or âchronicâ) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries."

121,What is the role of the liver relative to an alanine aminotransferase test?,Your liver does a lot of important things for you: It makes a fluid called bile that helps your body digest food. It removes waste products and other toxins from your blood. It produces proteins and cholesterol. Diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis can damage your liver and prevent it from doing its many jobs.
121,When should you talk to your doctor about an alanine aminotransferase test?,"To find out what type of liver disease you have, your doctor might also test the levels of other enzymes and proteins found in your liver, including: Albumin Alkaline phosphatase Bilirubin Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) Total protein Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand all of your liver test results. Also find out how these results might affect your treatment."
121,How do you prepare for an alanine aminotransferase test?,You don't need any special preparation for the ALT test. Your doctor might ask you to stop eating or drinking a few hours before the test.

121,Why is an alanine aminotransferase test important?,"Smaller amounts of ALT are in your kidneys and other organs, too. Your body uses ALT to break down food into energy. Normally, ALT levels in the blood are low. If your liver is damaged, it will release more ALT into your blood and levels will rise. ( ALT used to be called serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, or SGPT). Doctors often give the ALT test along with other liver tests. AST is another liver enzyme."
121,What other tests will you take in addition to an alanine aminotransferase test?,"The alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) test is a blood test that checks for liver damage. The ALT test can be done as part of a blood panel during a regular exam. AST is another liver enzyme. As with ALT, the levels of AST in your blood rise if your liver is damaged. Comparing ALT with AST levels gives your doctor more information about the health of your liver. The ALT-to- AST ratio can help your doctor figure out how severe the liver damage is and what might have caused it."

122,How does lipedema develop?,"As the condition progresses, fat continues to build up, and your lower body grows heavier. The lipedemic fat can later collect in the arms. Over time, fat cells block the vessels of your lymphatic system, which normally helps balance body fluid levels and protect against infection. This blockage prevents the proper drainage of lymph fluid, leading to a buildup of fluid called lymphedema."
122,What can happen if lipedema is untreated?,"Unlike obesity, it targets legs, thighs and sometimes arms. Unlike lymphedema, lipedema doesn't start in the lower legs (feet and ankles) but the upper legs, and it isn't related to prior surgery. It usually affects both legs."
122,What causes lipedema?,"The cause is not known, but doctors suspect female hormones play a role. That's because the condition affects mostly women, and it often begins or worsens at puberty, during pregnancy, following gynecologic surgery, and around the time of menopause. Scientists also believe genes are involved, because many women with the condition have family members with the condition."
122,Can diet and exercise help with lipedema?,The lipedemic fat can later collect in the arms.
122,What is lipedema?,"It happens when fat is distributed in an irregular way beneath your skin, usually in the buttocks and legs.

Lymphomas develop from lymphocytes, a type of blood cell involved in the immune system. Sarcomas involve the connective tissue (muscle, fat, or blood vessels). Other types include carcinoid, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Metastatic cancers from breast cancer, melanoma, and other primary sites of cancer are also seen in the stomach."
131,What are some good first solid foods to feed your baby?,"Single-grain cereals, such as rice, are common first foods, but you don't have to start with these. You can try purees of any healthy food, including meats, vegetables or fruits. Should you start out with vegetables so your baby learns to like them? There's no evidence to support this. Babies have a natural preference for sweets and the order you introduce foods doesn't change that."
131,Can I add solid foods to my baby's bottle?,"It's an important part of your baby's development to learn how to eat from a spoon and to join in family meal time. If your baby has been diagnosed with reflux, your pediatrician may have you add cereal to the bottle."
131,How can I prepare my baby to try his first solid food?,"To prepare: Pick a time when your baby is happy and not too hungry, overtired or cranky. Make sure you're not rushed, so that you can enjoy the experience. Choose one food to introduce first. Feed that to her for a few days before introducing the next new food, to check for possible allergic reactions. If you note diarrhea, rashes, or vomiting after introducing a new food, stop offering it and consult your pediatrician. If you offer cereal, make sure it's one made specifically for babies; they're fortified with specific nutrients babies need at this age."
131,When can my baby start eating solid foods?,"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for about six months, and notes that most babies are ready to start solid foods between four and six months. Here are some signs that your baby is ready: She loses the tongue-thrust reflex that pushes the spoon back out of her mouth. Sheï¿½ï¿½s interested in what you're eating -- making âoohâ sounds as she watches you eat, or trying to grab your fork or slice of bread. She can sit up with good head control in the high chair, although she still needs the support of her body. She can draw in her lower lip to take food from a spoon."
131,Should you continue breastfeeding even after you start feeding your baby  solid foods?,"Even after you start solids, breast milk or formula are your baby's primary source of nutrition for her first year. Keep breastfeeding for at least a year if you can. Don't wait too long to start solid foods."
132,Is there a cure for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)?,There is no cure for CRPS.
132,What are the symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)?,"The symptoms of CRPS vary in their severity and length. One symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain that gets worse rather than better over time. If CRPS occurs after an injury, it may seem out of proportion to the severity of the injury. Even in cases involving an injury only to a finger or toe, pain can spread to include the entire arm or leg. In some cases, pain can even travel to the opposite extremity. Other symptoms of CRPS include: "" Burning"" pain Swelling and stiffness in affected joints Motor disability, with decreased ability to move the affected body part Changes in nail and hair growth pattern; there may be rapid hair growth or no hair growth. Skin changes; CRPS can involve changes in skin temperature -- skin on one extremity can feel warmer or cooler compared to the opposite extremity. Skin color may become blotchy, pale, purple or red. The texture of skin also can change, becoming shiny and thin. People with CRPS may have skin that sometimes is excessively sweaty. CRPS may be heightened by emotional stress."
132,What is complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)?,"Experts believe that CRPS occurs as a result of dysfunction in the central or peripheral nervous systems. Other treatments include: Sympathetic nerve blocks: These blocks, which are done in a variety of ways, can provide significant pain relief for some people."
132,How is complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) treated?,"There is no cure for CRPS. Therapies used include psychotherapy, physical therapy, and drug treatment, such as topical analgesics, narcotics, corticosteroids, osteoporosis medication, antidepressants, osteoporosis medicines, and antiseizure drugs."
133,What is the best mattress for lower back pain?,"The latest thinking is that there isn't one type of mattress that's best for everyone, including people with chronic back pain. Let personal preference guide you, and choose what feels most comfortable."
133,How can you tell which mattress is best for your back pain?,Or choose a mattress that comes with a money-back guarantee: A growing number of companies will let you buy a mattress and use it for anywhere from 30 to 100 days and send it back for a refund if you're not happy with it.
133,When should you get a new mattress for lower back pain?,"Research is limited, but in one study, researchers assigned new mattresses to more than 300 people with low back pain. That was true regardless of which model they were given, though people who slept in the cheapest beds did report more lower back pain than those in the medium- and higher-priced beds. They noted that the average age of the participants' old beds was 9.5 years. The takeaway: If you've been sleeping on the same mattress for 9 or 10 years (or more), it's time to get a new one. Almost any new replacement is going to be better than the saggy foundation of an old mattress. But it may pay to spring for at least a mid-priced model."
133,How firm should a mattress be for lower back pain?,"The latest thinking is that there isn't one type of mattress that's best for everyone, including people with chronic back pain. They used either ""medium-firm"" or ""firm"" mattresses for 90 days. Those in the medium group reported the least amount of discomfort. You might consider getting a memory foam mattress (instead of a traditional innerspring one). The foam molds to your body. The downside: Some memory foam mattresses keep in heat; and the material might have more chemicals."
134,How long does a joint replacement last?,"Here are some activities that you should probably avoid after hip or knee replacement, but speak with your doctor first: Jogging, running, or skiing Playing football, basketball, soccer, and other high-impact sports Doing karate or other martial arts Jumping rope Taking a high-impact aerobics class Your new knee or hip can last for more than 15 years, especially if you treat it well. But the more stress and strain you put on the joint, the sooner it is likely to wear out or become loose. Just as before you had joint replacement surgery, activities that put less weight on your joints, like swimming and cycling, are particularly good for exercising a new joint without overstressing it."
134,How can I know if I'm ready for joint replacement surgery for osteoarthritis?,"Ask yourself these questions: Can I still do the things I enjoy doing, like golfing, shopping or playing with my grandchildren? Do the medications I take, and/or physical therapy, still alleviate the pain reasonably well? Can I sleep at night without waking up multiple times due to pain? Can I still do daily activities, like getting out of a chair, going up and down stairs, using the toilet, and getting into and out of the car without much difficulty? If the answers to all of these questions are yes, then you probably don't need to consider joint replacement surgery yet. On the other hand, if you answered ânoâ to most of them, then you should discuss joint replacement surgery as a possible option with your doctor."
134,What is a joint replacement surgery for osteoarthritis?,"Joint replacement or other surgical procedures are sometimes considered the âtreatment of last resortâ for people with osteoarthritis. Doctors frequently tell patients to wait as long as possible before joint replacement, but to get the best results, it should also not be delayed too long."
134,What  activities do I need to avoid after a hip of knee joint replacement surgery?,"If you're in your 90s, your doctor may discuss with you whether or not the risks of surgery are greater than the long-term benefits you may get from a new joint. High impact activities should be avoided for the rest of your life. Here are some activities that you should probably avoid after hip or knee replacement, but speak with your doctor first: Jogging, running, or skiing Playing football, basketball, soccer, and other high-impact sports Doing karate or other martial arts Jumping rope Taking a high-impact aerobics class Your new knee or hip can last for more than 15 years, especially if you treat it well."
134,What exercises do I need to do after a joint replacement surgery?,"In order to get the most function out of your new joint, there's a lot of hard work to be done right after surgery. Before pursuing joint replacement surgery, you should commit to an exercise program that will include: Regular walking, first at home and later outdoors and for longer distance, aimed at gradually and safely increasing your mobility Gradually resuming other normal daily activities, like standing, climbing stairs, and getting up and down from a chair Daily, regular exercises designed to strengthen the muscles around your new joint; after your physical therapist teaches you these exercises, you can often do them at home."
134,What are conditions that may make joint replacement surgery riskier?,"There are several conditions that may make joint replacement surgery riskier, including: Obesity . Your doctor may ask you to lose some weight before undergoing surgery, which will both lessen the risks of surgery (such as infections, bleeding, and problems with anesthesia) and give your new hip or knee a better chance of success. If you're in your 90s, your doctor may discuss with you whether or not the risks of surgery are greater than the long-term benefits you may get from a new joint. Bone density. Heart, lung, or kidney disease."
134,How much can joint replacement surgery for osteoarthritis help?,"The vast majority of people who undergo joint replacement surgery experience dramatic reductions in pain and a great improvement in their ability to do everyday things like going to the store, cleaning house, walking around town, and engaging in light exercise like walking, swimming, ballroom dancing, and stair climbing. According to a study published in June 2008 in the Archives of Internal Medicine, older adults who had joint replacement surgery improved significantly on measurements of arthritis symptoms one year later compared with people who did not have the surgery."
135,What is a carbuncle?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A carbuncle is a red, swollen, and painful cluster of boils that are connected to each other under the skin. A boil (or furuncle) is an infection of a hair follicle that has a small collection of pus (called an abscess) under the skin. Usually single, a carbuncle is most likely to occur on a hairy area of the body such as the back or nape of the neck. But a carbuncle also can develop in other areas of the body such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, and armpits."
135,What are complications of carbuncles?,"Sometimes, carbuncles are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA) bacteria, and require treatment with potent prescription antibiotics if the lesions are not drained properly. In rare cases, bacteria from a carbuncle can escape into the bloodstream and cause serious complications, including sepsis and infections in other parts of the body such as the lung, bones, joints, heart, blood, and central nervous system. Sepsis is an overwhelming infection of the body that is a medical emergency and can be fatal if left untreated. Symptoms include chills, a spiking fever, rapid heart rate, and a feeling of being extremely ill."
135,What is the home treatment for carbuncles?,"The cardinal rule is to avoid squeezing or irritating a carbuncle, which increases the risk of complications and severe scarring. Warm compresses may promote the drainage and healing of carbuncles. Gently soak the carbuncle in warm water, or apply a clean, warm, moist washcloth for 20 minutes several times per day. Similar strategies include covering the carbuncle with a clean, dry cloth and gently applying a heating pad or hot water bottle for 20 minutes several times per day. After each use, washcloths or cloths should be washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature. Washing the carbuncle and covering the area with a sterile bandage also may promote drainage and healing and help prevent the infection from spreading. Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain of an inflamed carbuncle. It's important to thoroughly wash your hands after touching a carbuncle. Launder any clothing, bedding, and towels that have touched a carbuncle and avoid sharing bedding, clothing, or other personal items."
135,What should I know about carbuncles?,"Carbuncles are more likely than boils to leave scars. An active boil or carbuncle is contagious: the infection can spread to other parts of the person's body or to other people through skin-to-skin contact or the sharing of personal items. So it's important to practice appropriate self-care measures, like keeping the area clean and covered, until the carbuncle drains and heals. Carbuncles require medical treatment to prevent or manage complications, promote healing, and minimize scarring. Contact your doctor if you have a boil or boils that have persisted for more than a few days."
135,How long do carbuncles take to heal?,"But treatment with antibiotics may be necessary in cases such as: When MRSA is involved and drainage is incomplete There is surrounding soft-tissue infection (cellulitis) A person has a weakened immune system An infection has spread to other parts of the body Depending on severity, most carbuncles heal within two to three weeks after medical treatment."
135,What causes carbuncles?,"Most carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, which inhabit the skin surface, throat, and nasal passages. These bacteria can cause infection by entering the skin through a hair follicle, small scrape, or puncture, although sometimes there is no obvious point of entry."
135,How can my doctor treat carbuncles?,Washing the carbuncle and covering the area with a sterile bandage also may promote drainage and healing and help prevent the infection from spreading. Some of the pus can be collected and sent to a lab to identify the bacteria causing the infection and check for susceptibility to antibiotics.
136,What are the warning signs of an acetaminophen overdose?,"If you think you may have accidentally taken too much acetaminophen, you may have: Nausea Loss of appetite Vomiting Sweating Diarrhea These symptoms may not start until hours after you've taken the drug. By the time you notice something's wrong, your liver may already be severely damaged. If you have questions about whether you took the right amount, call your local poison control center, which will tell you if you need to go to the ER. If you think someone may have overdosed, call 911."
136,How can you pass the daily limit for acetaminophen?,Common reasons people mistakenly pass the daily limit include: They take too much at once. They don't wait long enough between doses.
136,What drugs contain acetaminophen?,"It's still fine to use acetaminophen. For instance, if it's in your headache pill and your cold medicine, and you take them both, you could get more than you should."
136,When should you talk to your doctor about taking acetaminophen?,"In extreme cases, it can even cause liver failure. If you're not sure how much is OK, ask your doctor or pharmacist."
136,How can acetaminophen affect your liver?,"You use it to ease aches and pains or bring down a fever. When you follow the instructions on those pill-bottle labels, it's helpful and safe, and it generally doesn't upset the stomach like other pain relievers. In extreme cases, it can even cause liver failure. It's still fine to use acetaminophen. You just need to know how to do that safely. For instance, if it's in your headache pill and your cold medicine, and you take them both, you could get more than you should."
137,Could I be allergic to echinacea if I am allergic to other plants?,"If this happens, you might get: Rashes Worsening of asthma symptoms Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening emergency that can cause trouble breathing) You might be at higher risk of having a reaction to echinacea if you're allergic to other plants in the daisy family. This includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, and marigolds."
137,What is echinacea?,"It's a flowering plant that grows in the U. S. and Canada, and it's been used as medicine for centuries. There are nine species. Some of its common names are the purple coneflower or black-eyed Susan. The leaves, stems, flower, and roots are used to make supplements, liquid extracts, and teas."
137,How long should you take echinacea?,"Some experts say you shouldn't take echinacea for more than 8 weeks at a time. Although there is no evidence that the herb would cause harm after this point, doctors don't know enough yet about its long-term safety."
137,What are possible reasons for conflicting results of studies on echinacea?,"Still, sometimes it's hard to compare the results of different studies, because they look at different types and strengths of echinacea, as well as different parts of the plant or root. It's possible that some versions are better than others. Also, it's possible the herbal remedy may be useful against some, but not all, of the more than 200 viruses that cause colds."
137,Is echinacea regulated in the United States?,"Keep in mind that herbal remedies like echinacea aren't regulated in the U. S. the way medications are. The makers of supplements don't have to show their products are safe or effective before they go on the market. Also, there's a chance that what you buy at the drugstore may not actually have what the label says it does."
137,Can my doctor give me information about herbal cold remedies?,"If you're interested in using echinacea or another alternative treatment, talk to your doctor. Remember, herbal remedies may have risks, just like any drug. They can cause side effects and could affect how other medications work."
137,Should I try echinacea?,"Research shows it increases the number of white blood cells, which fight infections. Two studies funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health did not find any help for a cold from echinacea in either children or adults, though. Some experts say you shouldn't take echinacea for more than 8 weeks at a time. If you're interested in using echinacea or another alternative treatment, talk to your doctor."
137,Are there side effects of echinacea?,"Extracts of echinacea do seem to have an effect on the immune system, your body's defense against germs. The most common side effect is upset stomach. But some people can have allergic reactions. If this happens, you might get: Rashes Worsening of asthma symptoms Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening emergency that can cause trouble breathing) You might be at higher risk of having a reaction to echinacea if you're allergic to other plants in the daisy family."
138,When can you breastfeed your baby if you have tuberculosis (TB)?,"After your baby is born, you should be able to breastfeed her safely, even if you're still taking first-line drugs for TB. If you're on isoniazid, keep taking vitamin B6 while you nurse your newborn. Although some of the drug will pass into your breast milk, the amount is too little to cause any harm."
138,What are the effects of tuberculosis (TB) drugs during pregnancy?,"Catch TB from you after birth, if your disease is active and you aren't being treated You may worry that taking medicine for tuberculosis may harm your unborn child. It's much worse to leave it untreated. TB drugs you take do reach your baby. But they haven't been shown to cause harm in unborn babies. Some TB drugs can lead to birth defects or other problems in a growing baby. But your doctor won't prescribe those drugs if you're pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. The medicine you get will depend on what kind of TB you have."
139,What sleep milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"He can pull objects closer and pick them up in the palm of his hand then move them adeptly from one hand to the other. He may even be able to hold a bottle or sippy cup by himself. Most babies sleep through the night by five months, but not all. To encourage your baby to get into a regular nighttime sleep rhythm, establish a bedtime routine."
139,What communication milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"Your baby should be babbling away by now, and those babbles might even be starting to sound like real words. Five-month-olds can begin to put consonant and vowel sounds together (such as ''ba-ba''). If you hear a ''ma-ma'' or ''da-da'' in the mix, don't get too excited. Babies at this age haven't yet assigned meaning to words. Wait another couple of months and those ''ma-mas'' and ''da-das'' will be directed at you. At five months, babies are starting to make sense of the sounds they hear, such as a dog barking or a car engine starting. Though they can't yet understand words, they may turn their head at the sound of their name or a simple command like ''no.''"
139,What motor skills milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"Five-month-old babies can sit upright for longer periods of time. Your baby probably still needs to be propped up with a pillow or Boppy, but he may also be able to sit unsupported for a few seconds at a time. Some 5-month-olds can start rolling over from their back to their tummy. Once your baby does roll over, you may notice him working his legs and rocking. He's getting ready for crawling and scooting, which are just a couple of months away! But remember, when baby is able to roll over, make sure you never leave him on a bed or other high surface where he can accidentally roll off and get injured. Another thing you'll notice at five months is that your baby's grasp is getting stronger. He can pull objects closer and pick them up in the palm of his hand then move them adeptly from one hand to the other."
139,What milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"You can expect him to make his first attempts at real speech. He's also gearing up to start crawling, which means you need to be ready for your little one's new mobility. This portion of Web MD's month-by-month guide describes a few of the baby milestones you can expect your child to reach at five months. Five-month-old babies can sit upright for longer periods of time."
139,What are some tips for your babyâs fifth month?,"Babies love music. Play all kinds of songs for your 5-month-old, from classical to jazz to pop. He will clap, smile, and maybe even babble along. Give your baby simple, colorful toys like a soft block or rattle to play with. When you hand over each item, name it ('' This is a block,'' '' That's a rattle'') to help teach your baby new words. Consider removing the mobile hanging over your baby's crib. Once babies can push up onto their hands and knees, they can get caught up in the mobile's hanging cords. If you haven't baby-proofed your house by now, make sure you do it soon. Cover all electrical outlets, place household cleaners and other hazardous materials in locked cabinets, and put away all choking hazards. Also be very careful about not leaving steaming mugs of coffee or curling irons on countertops where your baby might pull them down."
139,What senses milestones should you expect in your 5-month-old?,"Your 5-month-old's vision is continuing to improve. At this point, babies still don't have 20/20 vision, but they can see well at different distances and their eyes can focus together without crossing. At five months, your baby's color perception has sharpened to the point where he can tell the difference between two shades of the same color. But babies at this age still prefer primary colors such as red, blue, and yellow."
140,How do you get medical marijuana?,"To get medical marijuana, you need a written recommendation from a licensed doctor in states where that is legal. ( Not every doctor is willing to recommend medical marijuana for their patients.) You must have a condition that qualifies for medical marijuana use. Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary."
140,Is medical marijuana regulated?,"Another issue is that the FDA doesn't oversee medical marijuana like it does prescription drugs. Although states monitor and regulate sales, they often don't have the resources to do so. That means the strength of and ingredients in medical marijuana can differ quite a bit depending on where you buy it. """

140,How do you take medical marijuana?,"To take medical marijuana, you can: Smoke it Inhale it through a device called a vaporizer that turns it into a mist Eat it -- for example, in a brownie or lollipop Apply it to your skin in a lotion, spray, oil, or cream Place a few drops of a liquid under your tongue How you take it is up to you. Each method works differently in your body. "" If you smoke or vaporize cannabis, you feel the effects very quickly,"" Bonn- Miller says. "" If you eat it, it takes significantly longer. It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible products."""

140,Is medical marijuana a legal form of treatment?,"More than half of U. S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some form, and more are considering bills to do the same. Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome."
140,How effective is medical marijuana?,"The greatest amount of evidence for the therapeutic effects of cannabis relate to its ability to reduce chronic pain, nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, and spasticity [tight or stiff muscles] from MS,"" Bonn- Miller says."
140,Is medical marijuana addictive?,"The National Institute on Drug Abuse says marijuana can be addictive and is considered a âgateway drugâ to using other drugs. "" The higher the level of THC and the more often you use, the more likely you are to become dependent,"" Bonn- Miller says. "" You have difficulty stopping if you need to stop."
140,What is medical marijuana?,"It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the ""high"" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it."
140,Why has so little research been done about medical marijuana?,"One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug. The agency did, however, agree to support additional research on marijuana and make the process easier for researchers."""
140,What are the medical benefits of cannabinoids?,Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. Research suggests cannabinoids might: Reduce anxiety Reduce inflammation and relieve pain Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth Relax tight muscles in people with MS Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and AIDS Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children.
140,Has the FDA approved medical marijuana?,"The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome."

Try to keep your nails short. Avoid injury to them as much as you can, too. Many people with psoriasis have a fungal infection in their nails (called onychomycosis). Ask your doctor or dermatologist to see if you have it. If so, treating the fungal infection will help your nails. If you have severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, your doctor may want you to take a prescription medication that affects your whole body. That should ease nail problems, too. Your doctor may point you to: Tar products Salicylic acid Corticosteroid creams or ointments You'll probably have more success if you use more than one of these at a time."

142,What are treatment options for children with depression?,"Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medicine. The role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. Your child's health care provider may suggest psychotherapy first, and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if symptoms are especially severe or if there is not significant improvement from psychotherapy alone. Currently, there are no good studies documenting the effectiveness of medicine over psychotherapy in children."
142,Who is at risk for childhood depression?,"Children with a family history of depression are at greater risk of experiencing depression themselves. Children who have parents that suffer from depression tend to develop their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents do not. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression."

It's an outpatient procedure -- one where you won't need to be admitted to the hospital -- that uses cuffs on the legs that inflate and deflate to boost blood supply to your coronary arteries.
144,What is angiogenesis for heart disease?,"For this treatment, you'll get stem cells and other genetic material through your vein or directly into your damaged heart tissue. It helps new blood vessels grow and go around the clogged ones."
144,How does coronary artery disease develop?,"Plaque can start to collect along your blood vessel walls when you're young and build up as you get older. That buildup inflames those walls and raises the risk of blood clots and heart attacks. The plaque makes the inner walls of your blood vessels sticky. Things like inflammatory cells, lipoproteins, and calcium attach to the plaque as they travel through your bloodstream."
144,How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"Your doctor can tell if you have coronary artery disease after: They learn your symptoms, medical history, and risk factors. They do a physical exam.

145,What causes gout?,"Any extra uric acid usually filters through the kidneys and gets passed in urine. If the body produces too much uric acid or fails to excrete it in the urine, crystals of monosodium urate form in the joints and tendons. These crystals cause intense inflammation leading to pain swelling and redness."
145,Is gout more common in men or women?,"More than 8 million Americans suffer from gout. Women are more prone to gout after menopause, and it is rare in children and young adults. Men who are overweight or suffering from high blood pressure are particularly prone to gout, especially if they are taking thiazide diuretics (water pills).

You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year."
147,How is radiation used to treat leukemia?,"You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over."
147,How is leukemia treated?,"The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are."
147,How is chemotherapy used to treat leukemia?,But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing.
147,How is leukemia grouped?,"Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly."
147,How is surgery used to treat leukemia?,Your doctor can remove your spleen if it is filled with cancer cells and is pressing on nearby organs. This procedure is called splenectomy.
147,How is biologic therapy used to treat leukemia?,But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow.

149,What should you know about caring for your feet if you have diabetic nerve pain?,"First, diabetes can reduce blood flow to your feet, depriving your feet of oxygen and nutrients. This makes it more difficult for blisters, sores, and cuts to heal. And second, the diabetic nerve damage called peripheral neuropathy can cause numbness in your feet. When you can't feel cuts and blisters, you're more likely to get sores and infections. If you don't notice or treat the sores, they can become deeply infected, and lead to amputation. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also cause sharp pain in your feet. You may become excruciatingly sensitive to the lightest touch, like the sheets on your bed. Fortunately, a little TLC goes a long way in preventing foot problems from diabetes. Controlling your blood glucose also helps reduce the symptoms of diabetic nerve pain."
150,How often should the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump be used?,"The pump can be used whenever the patient is feeling pain. However, patients should not press the button on the machine if they are feeling too sleepy. The more alert the patient is, the more likely he or she is to participate in a therapy program to aid and possibly shorten recovery. Once the acute pain from surgery is controlled, the patient will be switched to pills for pain relief. PCA pumps have built-in safety features. The total amount of analgesic (pain reliever) that the patient can self administer is within a safe limit."
151,What are eosinophils?,"When you have eosinophilic asthma, you have inflammation in your respiratory system caused by cells called eosinophils. Eosinophils are white blood cells. They're part of your body's immune system, and normally, they help you fight disease. One of their jobs is to help cause swelling. That may sound odd, but swelling is one of your body's key tools in fighting germs. But too much swelling can cause problems."

155,How is denosumab used in bone metastasis?,"Denosumab ( Xgeva). Similar to bisphosphonates, this drug is injected to help keep bone from breaking down."
155,What is the process by which cancers metastasize to the bones?,"The spread of cancer to bone is a complex process that doctors are just beginning to understand. Metastasis typically involves the following process: Cancer cells invade normal tissue nearby, then move through the walls of nearby lymph or blood vessels and begin circulating through the lymphatic system and bloodstream to reach other parts of the body. After stopping in small blood vessels at a further location, they invade the blood vessel walls and migrate into surrounding tissue where they multiply and form smaller tumors. Those new tumors need a blood supply for continued growth, so they stimulate the growth of new blood vessels."
155,What are some treatments that can help relieve bone metastasis pain and other symptoms?,"These treatments for the bone can help relieve bone metastasis pain and other symptoms: Radiation therapy. High-energy X-rays can kill cancer cells or slow their growth. Alone or combined with other treatments, this can relieve symptoms of bone mets. Radiopharmaceuticals. Used only for cancer that spreads to bone, these are drugs with radioactive elements. When they are injected, they go to the bone with cancer, killing cancer cells and helping to relieve pain. Low blood counts can be a side effect of this type of therapy. Ablation. In this method, a needle is put directly into a tumor to destroy it with heat, cold, electric current, or alcohol. MRI- Guided Focused Ultrasound. This is a noninvasive procedure that uses ultrasound energy guided by MRI scanning to destroy nerve endings in the area of the tumor. The procedure is used to relieve pain in people who have not had success with radiation or who are unable to be treated with radiation. Bisphosphonates ( Aredia and Zometa). Given intravenously ( IV) for bone mets, these drugs can reduce damage to the bone, lower the risk of breaks, reduce high blood calcium levels, and lessen pain. Denosumab ( Xgeva). Similar to bisphosphonates, this drug is injected to help keep bone from breaking down. Surgery. If bone damage is severe, inserting a supportive rod may be a good option. Other types of surgery may relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Injections of bone cement. These can also strengthen bones to prevent breaks. Your options for treatment of bone mets may vary depending on your type of cancer, your condition, and tolerance of possible side effects."
155,"What is the most common area of metastasis for breast, prostate, lung, or kidney cancer?","Bone metastasis is more likely with cancers such as: Breast Prostate Lung Kidney Thyroid About three out of four cases of bone metastasis result from tumors in the breast, prostate, lung, or kidney. Almost 70% of people with advanced breast or prostate cancer have bone metastasis; bone is commonly the first area of metastasis for these cancers."
155,How is ablation used to treat bone metastasis?,"In this method, a needle is put directly into a tumor to destroy it with heat, cold, electric current, or alcohol."
155,How do doctors treat bone metastasis?,"Other factors include: Which bones the cancer has invaded Damage to the bones Which treatments you have already had Your state of health In most cases, doctors treat bone metastasis by treating the primary cancer. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy are examples of treatments commonly used to treat the primary cancer. These are systemic treatments, so they can travel through the bloodstream to reach different parts of the body."
155,How is surgery used to treat bone metastasis?,"If bone damage is severe, inserting a supportive rod may be a good option. Other types of surgery may relieve pressure on the spinal cord."
155,Where are the most common places for cancer to spread?,Here are the types of cancer that are most likely to metastasize to the bone and what treatments can provide relief.
155,What are some factors that doctors consider when treating bone metastasis?,"But treatment can often help relieve symptoms. The kind of treatment your doctor recommends depends, in part, on what kind of primary cancer you have. Other factors include: Which bones the cancer has invaded Damage to the bones Which treatments you have already had Your state of health In most cases, doctors treat bone metastasis by treating the primary cancer."
155,How are injections of bone cement used to treat bone metastasis?,These can also strengthen bones to prevent breaks.
155,Why and where do tumors form in the bones?,The type of cancer may have something to do with why tumors form in bones. Certain cancers may release proteins that affect how a tumor forms.
155,Why do tumors most often form in the bones?,"The type of cancer may have something to do with why tumors form in bones. Certain cancers may release proteins that affect how a tumor forms. Bones provide fertile ground for the growth of tumor cells, because they are areas of constant cell turnover and growth. And bone cells release substances that may prompt faster cancer growth."
155,How is MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound used to treat bone metastasis?,This is a noninvasive procedure that uses ultrasound energy guided by MRI scanning to destroy nerve endings in the area of the tumor. The procedure is used to relieve pain in people who have not had success with radiation or who are unable to be treated with radiation.
155,What are the symptoms of bone metastasis?,"Compression of the spinal cord if cancer in a bone of the spine grows and puts pressure on the spinal cord; this can cause nerve symptoms of numbness, weakness, urinary problems, and paralysis."
155,How are radiopharmaceuticals used to treat bone metastasis?,"Used only for cancer that spreads to bone, these are drugs with radioactive elements. When they are injected, they go to the bone with cancer, killing cancer cells and helping to relieve pain. Low blood counts can be a side effect of this type of therapy."
155,How is bone metastasis usually treated?,"Other factors include: Which bones the cancer has invaded Damage to the bones Which treatments you have already had Your state of health In most cases, doctors treat bone metastasis by treating the primary cancer. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy are examples of treatments commonly used to treat the primary cancer. These are systemic treatments, so they can travel through the bloodstream to reach different parts of the body."
155,What factors are involved in the treatment of bone metastasis other than type of primary cancer?,"Other factors include: Which bones the cancer has invaded Damage to the bones Which treatments you have already had Your state of health In most cases, doctors treat bone metastasis by treating the primary cancer."
155,Which bones do cancer cells usually go to?,"This includes bones in the: Spine Pelvis Ribs Upper arms Thighs In some cases, areas of bone are destroyed (osteolytic). When they are injected, they go to the bone with cancer, killing cancer cells and helping to relieve pain."
155,What happens when cancer cells reach the bone?,"Once in the bone, these cancer cells can form new metastatic tumors. So they may go through more changes. This means the new tumor may be somewhat different from the primary tumor. This can make it more difficult to treat."
155,How are bisphosphonates used to treat bone metastasis?,"Used only for cancer that spreads to bone, these are drugs with radioactive elements. Given intravenously ( IV) for bone mets, these drugs can reduce damage to the bone, lower the risk of breaks, reduce high blood calcium levels, and lessen pain."
155,In which bones do cancer cells typically go?,"This includes bones in the: Spine Pelvis Ribs Upper arms Thighs In some cases, areas of bone are destroyed (osteolytic). When they are injected, they go to the bone with cancer, killing cancer cells and helping to relieve pain."
155,Where are the most common places for cancer cells to spread?,"Once in the bone, these cancer cells can form new metastatic tumors. Do you then have bone cancer? For example, breast cancer that spreads is known as ""metastatic breast cancer."" Metastatic cancers in the bone are also called bone metastases, or bone ""mets."" Here are the types of cancer that are most likely to metastasize to the bone and what treatments can provide relief."
155,"If my cancer moves to my bones, do I have bone cancer?","Once in the bone, these cancer cells can form new metastatic tumors. Do you then have bone cancer? For example, breast cancer that spreads is known as ""metastatic breast cancer."" Metastatic cancers in the bone are also called bone metastases, or bone ""mets."""
156,How does cancer immunotherapy work?,"It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells."
156,How do checkpoint inhibitors treat mesothelioma?,"Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense."
157,How do I know if I have ankylosing spondylitis?,"There is no specific test to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis, but imaging by X-ray and MRI may show evidence of inflammation of the sacroiliac joint between the sacrum (the triangular bone at the lowest part of the back) and the ilium (the bone felt on the upper part of the hip). Some symptoms may include: Inflammatory back pain (gradual in onset, lasting over three months, with stiffness and pain that is worse in the morning and improved with movement) Reduced mobility of the spine Reduced ability to expand the chest Your doctor may order a number of different blood tests that can suggest ankylosing spondylitis. For example, if you have the disorder, you are likely to have an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells settle out of your blood) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (a protein that is usually not in blood at high levels but may be elevated in cases of inflammation)."
157,How can I prevent ankylosing spondylitis?,"If you are diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, it is important to seek help from a physical therapist. The condition is largely due to genetics, although you may not be aware of anyone in your family with similar symptoms."
158,How should you lift objects to prevent back pain?,"When you have to lift heavy objects, don't bend at the waist. Squat with your legs and keep your back upright as you grasp the object and stand upright again. Let your legs do the lifting, not your back."
158,Does posture affect back pain?,"First, analyze your posture by standing with your heels against a wall. Your calves, buttocks, shoulders, and the back of your head should touch the wall. You should be able to slip your hand behind the small of your back. Now step forward and stand normally. If your posture changes, correct it right away. If you stand for long periods at work, wear flat shoes with good arch support and get a box or step about 6 inches high to rest one foot on from time to time."
158,How can you strengthen your back to prevent back pain?,"Finally, ask your doctor or health club trainer about back-strengthening exercises. You might also check with your local YMCA or hospital for back-strengthening classes. These stretching and strengthening exercises can help chronic back pain and prevent future episodes. Also, some forms of yoga and tai chi may help you learn proper posture and improve strength, balance, and flexibility."
158,Can my lifestyle help prevent back pain?,"Excess weight puts a strain on the back, so maintaining a healthy weight is important. Regular exercise, especially core work, keeps the abdominal and back muscles firm. Smoking ages the spine, so avoid smoking and inhaling secondhand smoke. Practicing good posture is another way to help prevent back pain."
158,How should you sit to prevent back pain?,You should be able to slip your hand behind the small of your back. Your chair back should be set at an angle of about 10 degrees and should cradle the small of your back comfortably. Your forearms should rest on your desk or work surface with your elbows almost at a right angle.
159,Should I consider surgery for ulcerative colitis flares?,"It's not an immediate fix, and not everyone needs an operation to keep UC in check. But for some people, it can help. Your doctor might suggest surgery if you've had the condition for a long time, or if your flares are so severe that drugs no longer control them. An operation might help prevent colon cancer, which people with UC are more likely to get."
159,Should I self-medicate for ulcerative colitis flares?,"Unless your doctor has OK'd it ahead of time, don't pick and choose your own treatment. Something you have in your medicine cabinet from a previous flare might have helped you in the past. But have those meds expired? And are they right for you this time? Check with your doctor first."
159,What are the procedures for ulcerative colitis surgery?,"There are two different types of procedures. Both surgeries remove the colon and rectum. Once those parts are gone, so are the pain, inflammation, and constant urges to go to the bathroom that happen during a flare. You'll still need to go often, but less than before. In one operation, the surgeon uses the end of your own small bowel to create a pouch connected to your anus on the inside of your body. ( You would temporarily need to wear a bag outside your body over the hole that your surgeon makes, until your body heals from the surgery and is ready for the internal pouch.) In the other procedure, the surgeon creates a small opening in the abdomen to collect waste in a removable pouch on the outside of the body. Your doctor can let you know if either operation would help you."
159,When should I take my meds for ulcerative colitis flares?,"Or you might think it's OK to skip them because you feel fine. But you need to stick with the plan your doctor prescribed to keep up those benefits. Many people with UC stay on low doses of drugs such as 5- ASAs, which ease inflammation in the colon, or meds such as 6- MP and azathioprine, which turn down an overactive immune system. Your doctor can also check on your treatment plan or see if you need to take another medicine for a short time to help you get through your discomfort."
160,What do I do if I have an asthma attack while exercising?,"It's when your airways constrict and you have asthma symptoms during exercise, such as: Coughing Wheezing Chest tightness Shortness of breath If this happens to you, stop and follow the instructions in your asthma action plan. Keep your rescue inhaler handy, and use it as directed as soon as you have symptoms. If your symptoms are not getting better, call for emergency medical help."
160,What activities are beneficial to people with asthma?,"Team sports that involve short bursts of exertion -- like volleyball, gymnastics, baseball, and wrestling -- are good, and so are solo or group leisure activities like walking, biking, and hiking. Swimming is also a good choice because you usually breathe in plenty of warm, moist air while you do it. It's also a great way to build upper-body strength."
160,What should I do to control my asthma when I exercise?,"Before starting an exercise program, talk to your doctor. Always use your pre-exercise asthma medicine (inhaled bronchodilators or cromolyn), if directed by your asthma action plan, before beginning exercise. Perform warm-up exercises, and have a good cool-down period after exercise. If the weather is cold, exercise indoors or wear a mask or scarf over your nose and mouth. If you have allergic asthma, avoid exercising outdoors when pollen counts or air pollution counts are high. Restrict exercise when you have a viral infection, like a cold."
160,What types of exercise are best for people with asthma?,"Team sports that involve short bursts of exertion -- like volleyball, gymnastics, baseball, and wrestling -- are good, and so are solo or group leisure activities like walking, biking, and hiking. Activities that involve long periods of exertion, such as soccer, distance running, basketball, and field hockey, may not be as easy. Also, cold-weather sports, such as ice hockey, cross-country skiing, and ice skating, may pose challenges. But many people with asthma are able to fully take part in these activities."
161,What opportunistic infections can occur in children with HIV?,"Some of the more common are: Failure to thrive, which means not gaining weight or growing like doctors expect Not having the skills or doing the things doctors expect a child that age would (not reaching developmental milestones) Brain or nervous system problems such as seizures, trouble walking, or doing poorly in school Being sick often with childhood illnesses such as an ear infection, a cold, an upset stomach, or diarrhea As with adults, when an HIV infection advances, kids start to develop infections that rarely affect healthy people but can be deadly for someone whose immune system isn't working well. These ""opportunistic infections"" include: Pneumocystis pneumonia, a fungal infection of the lungs Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) A kind of lung scarring called lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis ( LIP) Oral thrush or severe diaper rash from a yeast infection Children get pretty much the same treatment as adults: a combination of medications called ART (antiretroviral therapy)."
161,What is the cause of HIV and AIDS in children?,"Most children who have HIV got it from their mother when she was pregnant, during the birth process, or from breastfeeding. Women who are tested, and then stick with treatment if they're positive, greatly lower the chance of passing the virus to their babies. This is the best way to prevent HIV in children. Kids in communities affected by AIDS who have lost parents and family members are also more vulnerable to HIV infection. They may lack caregivers, access to school, or the ability to stand up for their rights. Children can be infected through sexual abuse or rape. In central and Eastern Europe, injected drug use spreads HIV among young people living on the streets. The U. S. and Western European countries have medical safeguards to prevent this problem."
162,What happens to my HIV test results?,"Your HIV test results become part of your medical record. Therefore, the results could be disclosed to third-party payers (such as medical insurance companies) and other authorized parties. A positive test result will also be reported to the appropriate health department."
162,What do HIV results mean?,"It generally takes two to 8 weeks for your body to produce antibodies, but in some cases it can take up to six months. No. Being infected with HIV does not necessarily mean that you have AIDS. A negative test does not always mean that you do not have HIV. Signs of HIV may not show up in the blood for several months after infection. For this reason, you should be tested again if you could have been exposed to HIV or are at risk for HIV infection."
163,Can I still exercise if I have a cold?,"It's usually safe to do it as long as you listen to your body. You'll need to watch out for certain risky situations. Physical activity increases your heart rate, but so can some cold medicines. So a combo of exercise and decongestants can cause your heart to pump very hard. You may become short of breath and have trouble breathing. If you have asthma and a cold, make sure you talk with your doctor before you exercise. It may cause you to cough and wheeze more and make you short of breath."
163,Is it good to exercise if I have a fever?,"When your cold comes with a fever, exercise could stress your body even more. So wait a few days to get back to your regular exercise program. Also be careful about working out too hard when you have a cold. It can make you feel worse and slow down your recovery."
163,Can exercise help prevent colds?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } If you're looking for a safe way to prevent colds, regular exercise may be the ticket. And you don't have to run a marathon, either. Moderate activity is all you need. Exercise improves your overall fitness, which can help boost your immune system -- the body's defense against infections."
163,Can you exercise so much it makes you sick?,"It's not a problem for most of us, but if you're an exercise fiend, make sure you take time for rest and recovery after periods of intense training. Your immune system works best when it isn't stressed. Scientists say athletes who train intensely without building in recovery time are more likely to get colds or flu. When workouts get too strenuous, the number of infection-fighting white blood cells in your body can go down. At the same time, your stress hormone cortisol may go up, which may interfere with the ability of certain immune cells to work right."
163,How does exercise affect white blood cell count?,"Researchers found that regular walking may lead to a higher number of white blood cells, which fight infections. In another study, researchers found that in 65-year-olds who did regular exercise, the number of T-cells -- a specific type of white blood cell -- was as high as those of people in their 30s."
163,What are signs that I should stop exercising if I have a cold?,Stop your activity and get emergency medical help if you: Feel chest tightness or pressure Have trouble breathing or get very short of breath Get lightheaded or dizzy Have problems with balance
163,How much exercise is necessary to reduce illness?,"Some studies show that ""moderate intensity"" exercise may cut down the number of colds you get. That type of activity includes things like a 20- to 30-minute walk every day, going to the gym every other day, or biking with your kids a few times a week. In one study in the American Journal of Medicine, women who walked for a half-hour every day for 1 year had half the number of colds as those who didn't exercise."
164,How should I manage allergies and prevent asthma?,"If you have allergies and asthma, it's important to keep your distance from allergens (things you're allergic to). Allergen exposure can increase the inflammation in your airways for a while, making an attack more likely."
164,How can an asthma diary help in asthma prevention?,"Keep track of your symptoms in an asthma diary for several weeks. Detail all the environmental and emotional things that affect your asthma. When you have an asthma attack, check the diary to see which thing, or combination of things, might have led to it. Some common asthma triggers, like molds and cockroaches, aren't always obvious. Ask your asthma specialist about tests to find the allergens you respond to. Then take steps to avoid them."
164,What do I need to know about preventing asthma symptoms?,"If you have asthma, you need to do what you can to cut your exposure to asthma triggers. Asthma triggers can aggravate your symptoms -- coughing, wheezing, and having a hard time catching your breath. While there's no cure, there are steps you can take to keep your asthma in control and prevent an attack."
164,How should I allergy-proof my environment for asthma prevention?,"Whether you're at home, work, or traveling, there are things you can do to allergy-proof your environment and lower your chances of an asthma attack. Don't eat in restaurants that are smoky or allow cigarette smoking. Reserve a smoke-free hotel room. If you can, bring your own bedding and pillows in case the hotel only supplies feather pillows and down comforters."
164,How do allergy shots (immunotherapy) help prevent asthma?,"If your doctor finds that you have allergies, allergy shots (immunotherapy) may help prevent allergy symptoms and keep your asthma from getting worse. With allergy shots, the doctor injects small doses of allergens under your skin on a regular schedule. Over time, your body may get used to the allergen and respond less when you're exposed."
164,Why should I avoid colds to prevent asthma?,"Avoid close contact with people who have a cold or the flu, because catching it will make your asthma symptoms worse. Wash your hands well if you handle items that someone with a respiratory infection may have touched."
164,What are examples of asthma triggers?,Certain asthma triggers can set off a cascade of asthma symptoms. These include: Air pollution Allergies Cold air A cold or flu virus Sinusitis Smoke Fragrances It's vital to learn to identify your asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them.
164,How do I prevent exercise-induced asthma?,"If you have exercise-induced asthma, are planning a heavy workout, or plan to exercise in cold, humid, or dry air, take steps to prevent an asthma attack."
165,How should I adjust my devices to prevent eyestrain?,"You can also make sure your devices are set for eye health. Raise the contrast on your screen. Make text larger. Change the brightness of the screen. It shouldn't be lighter or darker than your surroundings. Lower the color temperature of your screen. That means it will give off less blue light, which is linked to more eyestrain. Raise the device's refresh rate. That will cause less flickering of the screen."
165,How can I prevent digital eyestrain?,"But a few changes to how your use your devices can be easier on your eyes. Make sure your computer screen is about 25 inches, or an arm's length, away from your face. The center of the screen should be about 10-15 degrees below eye level. Cut glare by using a matte screen filter. You can find them for all types of computers, phones, and tablets. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Take a longer break of about 15 minutes after every 2 hours you spend on your devices. Use artificial tears to refresh your eyes when they feel dry. Try putting a humidifier in the room where you most often use a computer or other device. Make sure the lighting in the room you're in is bright enough. You don't want your device to be brighter than the surroundings. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing your glasses. Get regular eye exams. You might need to use a different pair of glasses when you're working on a computer."
165,Why do screens cause eyestrain?,"That spreads tears evenly over your eyes, which keeps them from getting dry and irritated. But researchers have found that people blink less than half as often when they're reading, watching, or playing on a screen. Also, the contrast of text against the background, the glare, and flickering from digital screens can be hard on your eyes. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds."
166,What causes diabetic macular edema?,"High blood sugar weakens the blood vessels in your eyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of your eye. This is called diabetic retinopathy. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharp vision."
166,What tests are used to diagnose diabetic macular edema?,"If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram ( FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. The dye is injected into your arm, but travels quickly to your eye. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina. It is very sensitive and can find even small amounts of fluid and swelling."
166,What procedures are done to treat diabetic macular edema?,"These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes steroid injections may help. Another treatment is a surgery called vitrectomy. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema), and doctors take out the fluid that is clouding your vision and replace it with a clear solution."
166,What drugs are used to treat diabetic macular edema?,"To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation."
166,What questions will your doctor ask before diagnosing diabetic macular edema?,"Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions: Have you noticed changes in your vision? If so, what kind? Have you been diagnosed with diabetes? If so, when? Does anyone in your family have it? How have your blood sugar and A1c levels been lately? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Do you have any other medical conditions?"
166,What eye exams are used to diagnose diabetic macular edema?,"You will need a thorough eye exam, which usually includes: A visual acuity test. It checks how well you see at different distances. A dilated eye exam. Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina."
166,Where can you get support for diabetic macular edema?,"For more information about the eye conditions related to diabetes, go to the web site of the American Diabetes Association. They have links that can help you get the support you need."
166,What is diabetic macular edema?,"High blood sugar can lead to other conditions, like eye problems. The most common one is diabetic macular edema. It's serious and can rob you of your vision. Have you been diagnosed with diabetes?"
167,How are corticosteroids injected into the body to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,Corticosteroids can sometimes be injected directly into joints affected by RA. This is a good way to get the benefits of the drug with fewer side effects.
167,How do corticosteroids treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"For RA, their benefit is that they suppress the overactive immune system, which curbs symptoms. Corticosteroids act throughout the body, not just on the immune system. So they're best used for a short time to control flares. This helps you avoid their side effects."
167,What are the drawbacks of using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain?,"NSAIDs include: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac ( Cataflam, Voltaren) Etodolac ( Lodine) Ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) Indomethacin ( Indocin) Meloxicam ( Mobic) Naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) NSAIDS have been linked to increased risk of heart attack and stroke, particularly in higher doses. Another drawback is that these drugs can upset your stomach or cause ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. Celecoxib is less likely to cause ulcers and stomach or intestinal bleeding. If you have kidney failure or heart failure, your doctor will keep a close watch on how you're doing if you take NSAIDs."
167,What are the main types of medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"There are many medications you and your doctor could consider using to treat your RA pain. The main type are NSAIDs, which stands for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They manage pain, swelling, and stiffness."
167,How do corticosteroids treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain?,"These are often called steroids. They're powerful drugs that tame inflammation. They're different from âanabolicâ steroids that build up muscles. For RA, their benefit is that they suppress the overactive immune system, which curbs symptoms."
167,How long will I need to take corticosteroids to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis, you may need to take steroids for a long time. Your doctor will watch out for potential side effects, such as being more likely to get an infection, higher blood sugar, or bone thinning."
167,How do non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"There are many medications you and your doctor could consider using to treat your RA pain. The main type are NSAIDs, which stands for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They manage pain, swelling, and stiffness."
167,How does acetaminophen treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain?,"This is in many prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including Tylenol. When taken as directed, it has few side effects in most people. One exception is people with liver disease, who can take acetaminophen only if their doctor watches their health closely."
167,Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis associated with side effects?,"NSAIDs include: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac ( Cataflam, Voltaren) Etodolac ( Lodine) Ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) Indomethacin ( Indocin) Meloxicam ( Mobic) Naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) NSAIDS have been linked to increased risk of heart attack and stroke, particularly in higher doses.

168,How do you know if your rheumatoid arthritis (RA) doctor is right for you?,"You'll want to see a rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in arthritis and other joint and muscle problems. He should respond to your needs and take the time to find the best treatment plan for you. He should be willing to make changes to your treatment if you don't feel better, and to refer you to other health pros, such as physical therapists and occupational therapists, if you need them."
168,Should I ask my doctor if I'm on the right medicine for rheumatoid arthritis?,"If they used to work and don't seem to help anymore, it may be time for a change. Some ""disease-modifying"" drugs may not work as well after a while. Your doctor may recommend a different prescription or add another type of drug, such as a biologic, to your treatment."
168,How can I determine if my rheumatoid arthritis doctor is a good fit for me?,"You'll want to see a rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in arthritis and other joint and muscle problems. He should respond to your needs and take the time to find the best treatment plan for you. He should be willing to make changes to your treatment if you don't feel better, and to refer you to other health pros, such as physical therapists and occupational therapists, if you need them."
168,Should I keep up my regular checkups for rheumatoid arthritis?,"Some RA drugs affect your immune system -- your body's defense against germs.

181,What questions will my doctor ask me if I have symptoms of renal cell carcinoma?,"As the disease gets more serious, you might have warning signs like: A lump on your side, belly, or lower back Blood in your pee Low back pain on one side Losing weight for no clear reason Not feeling hungry Fever Feeling tired Not enough red blood cells (anemia) Night sweats High levels of calcium in your blood High blood pressure Your doctor will want to find out more about your symptoms to figure out what's going on. First, he'll give you a physical exam and ask you questions like: When did you first notice a problem? Is there blood in your urine? Have you been having any pain? Where? Does anything make your symptoms better or worse? Has anyone in your family had von Hippel- Lindau disease? What about kidney cancer?"
181,What causes renal cell carcinoma?,Scientists aren't sure exactly what causes renal cell carcinoma. They know that most kidney cancers start when something goes wrong in the genes in the kidney. No one can say for certain why that happens.
181,When does renal cell carcinoma start?,"Most people who have renal cell carcinoma are older, usually between ages 50 and 70. It often starts as just one tumor in a kidney, but sometimes it begins as several tumors, or it's found in both kidneys at once. You might also hear it called renal cell cancer."

182,How safe is a breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?,A breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a test that is sometimes performed along with a screening mammogram in women with at least a 20% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. It is often done in women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer to measure size and extent of the breast cancer.
182,How long is the breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test?,"Tell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions: Heart pacemaker Cerebral aneurysm clip (metal clip on a blood vessel in the brain) Implanted insulin pump (for treatment of diabetes), narcotics pump (for pain medication), or implanted nerve stimulators ("" TENS"") for back pain Metal in the eye or eye socket Cochlear (ear) implant for hearing impairment Implanted spine stabilization rods Severe lung disease Uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux (a condition causing severe heartburn) A tissue expander with magnetic port after mastectomy In addition, tell your doctor if you: Are pregnant Weigh more than 300 pounds Are not able to lie on your back for 30 to 60 minutes Have claustrophobia (fear of closed or narrow spaces) Allow 1 1/2 hours for your breast MRI exam. In most cases, the procedure takes 45 to 60 minutes, during which time several dozen images are obtained."
182,What happens during a breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?,"You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during your breast MRI. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound that will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should experience no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require that you receive an injection of a contrast material known as gadolinium."
182,What happens before a breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?,"Hearing aids should be removed before the test, because they can be damaged by the magnetic field."
183,How is psychogenic pain diagnosed?,The diagnosis of psychogenic pain is made only when all other causes of pain are ruled out. A person with psychogenic pain disorder will complain of pain that does not match his or her symptoms. Medical doctors and mental health specialists working together are often most helpful to those with this disorder.
183,What is psychogenic pain?,"Psychogenic pain is a pain disorder associated with psychological factors. Some types of mental or emotional problems can cause, increase or prolong pain."

Your temperature goes above 100 F for more than 4 hours."
184,When do I take off the bandage from surgery?,"Your doctor will give you exact instructions on when and how to change it. Most wounds don't need one after a few days, but if you keep the area covered, it may help protect the cut from injury and it may heal faster. If you do keep a bandage on, change it every day. Wash your hands well with soap and water before and after."
184,Should I limit activities after surgery?,"It's best to avoid movement that affects the area surrounding your wound. That way, you'll lower your risk of pulling the cut apart.

You might be able to shower by the second day, but it depends on the type of operation you had, so check with your doctor. Once you have the go-ahead to get your whole body wet, it's better to shower than to take a bath. That's because soaking your wound can soften it and may cause it to open up again. Ask if you need to put on a waterproof dressing. If your cut opens up, call your doctor."

185,What are other kinds of treatments for neuropathic pain?,"Effective management of the condition can also help prevent further nerve damage. Some of these include: Physical therapy Working with a counselor Relaxation therapy Massage therapy Acupuncture Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and occasionally may get worse instead of better over time."
185,What is neuropathic pain?,"It often is the result of nerve damage or a malfunctioning nervous system. The impact of nerve damage is a change in nerve function both at the site of the injury and areas around it. !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This rare condition occurs when an arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now misfire and cause pain. But some common causes of neuropathic pain include: Alcoholism Amputation Chemotherapy Diabetes Facial nerve problems HIV infection or AIDS Multiple myeloma Multiple sclerosis Nerve or spinal cord compression from herniated discs or from arthritis in the spine Shingles Spine surgery Syphilis Thyroid problems Neuropathic pain symptoms may include: Shooting and burning pain Tingling and numbness To diagnose neuropathic pain, a doctor will conduct an interview and physical exam."
186,What can you expect during a lip augmentation procedure?,"Injectable lip augmentation techniques can be performed quickly in your doctor's office with little to no downtime. Fat injection is the exception, since the procedure requires a small area of liposuction to remove the fat from another part of your body before the injection can take place. Before the injections, a topical or local numbing agent may be applied to ease discomfort. Sometimes, nerve block injections can be given before the treatment to completely numb the lips. This is similar to the anesthetic injections that you get at the dentist to numb your mouth. After carefully marking the areas to be injected, very fine needles are used to inject the substance into your lips."
186,How common are allergic reactions to hyaluronic acid fillers?,"Allergic reaction unlikely.

Enhanced lips may make your lips plumper and fuller, but you will still be you when you walk out of the doctor's office."
186,When might you not be a candidate for lip augmentation?,"Lip augmentation is a cosmetic procedure that can give you fuller, plumper lips. Before undergoing lip augmentation you should be in good health and a nonsmoker. You may not be a candidate for lip augmentation if you have: An active infection such as oral herpes Diabetes Lupus Blood-clotting problems If you have ever had a cold sore (oral herpes) any time in the past, you should tell your doctor before undergoing the procedure.

Among them are these products: Restylane, Restylane- L, Restylane Silk Juvederm Ultra, Juvederm Ultra Plus Belotero Balance Hyla Form Elevess Prevelle Silk Captique All of these products are injected the same way and give you similar results. And some contain lidocaine, a local anesthetic."
186,What is collagen and fat injections as lip augmentation?,"Lip augmentation is a cosmetic procedure that can give you fuller, plumper lips. These days, an injectable dermal filler is the most commonly used method of lip augmentation. The newer options are safer and the effects last longer. Fat injections and implants are other methods to plump lips. But they aren't used as much today because the results vary and there is a greater risk of side effects."
186,Is lip augmentation right for you?,"Lip augmentation is a cosmetic procedure that can give you fuller, plumper lips. It helps increase volume in your lips. To answer this question, you must first ask yourself why you want to modify your lips.

188,How often should men have sex or ejaculate to help prevent prostate cancer?,"The exact number of times didn't matter. Basically, the more men ejaculated in a month, the less likely they were to get prostate cancer. Why might ejaculation help prostate health? Experts aren't sure. Some believe that it can flush out harmful chemicals that might build up in semen. While research is promising, there's still a lot scientists need to learn. Some things to consider: There's no proof that ejaculating more actually causes lower chances of prostate cancer. For now, doctors just know they're connected. It may be that men who do it more tend to have other healthy habits that are lowering their odds."
188,How can sex and masturbation affect my risks of getting a prostate cancer?,"Research suggests that the more often men ejaculate, the less likely they are to have the disease. Some things to consider: There's no proof that ejaculating more actually causes lower chances of prostate cancer. For now, doctors just know they're connected. It may be that men who do it more tend to have other healthy habits that are lowering their odds."
188,What does the research show about whether ejaculation lowers the risk of getting prostate cancer?,"But the 2016 results of a major study made the strongest case yet. The researchers asked men to answer questions about how often they ejaculated. Then they tracked almost 32,000 of these men for 18 years. The researchers found that guys who did it the most (at least 21 times a month) had about a 20% lower chance of prostate cancer, compared with those who did it less (4 to 7 times a month). That was true in several age groups. But some smaller studies have not shown the same good results."

190,What can happen if you have dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"The vision loss from dry AMD happens slowly and usually is not as severe as that from wet AMD. But dry AMD can sometimes turn into the wet form. Up to 5% of people who have dry AMD in both eyes will get wet AMD in a year, while 13% to 18% will get it in 3 years."
190,How common is dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,About 2/3 of people with AMD are women and 1/3 men.
190,Are there different types of age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"There are two types of AMD, dry and wet. Both can lead to vision problems, so learn as much as you can about the causes of the disease and the steps you can take to keep your eyes healthy."
190,How does race and ethnicity affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"Whites have the highest risk of AMD, followed by Chinese and Hispanic/ Latino people and, with the least risk, African- Americans. Whites are also more likely to go blind from AMD than African- Americans. About a third of whites have a gene that's been linked with AMD. If you have light-colored eyes, you also have greater odds of developing dry AMD, possibly because light eyes don't deflect ultraviolet rays as well as dark eyes."
190,How does gender affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,About 2/3 of people with AMD are women and 1/3 men. This may be because women live longer than men.

190,What raises your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,Scientists have identified 20 or so genes which may be linked to more than half of AMD cases. This helps explain why you have a higher risk of AMD if other members of your family have it. But genes aren't the whole story. There are other things that may combine with genes to raise your chances of getting AMD.
190,At what age is your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) increased?,"This is the No. 1 thing that puts you at risk for AMD. About 2% of people in their 50s have AMD, and almost a third of people over 75 do."
190,What causes age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"Some things that are linked to AMD are out of your control, like the genes that your parents passed down to you. Others, like smoking, diet, or high blood pressure, are things you can do something about."
190,How does smoking affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"If you smoke, your risk for AMD could be up to four times as much as someone who has never smoked. This is probably because smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that goes to different parts of your body, including your eyes."
190,How does heart disease affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"If you've had a stroke, angina (a type of chest pain), or a heart attack, your risk for AMD may be 1 1/2 times as high as someone who has not had any of these problems. High cholesterol levels may also raise your risk."
190,How can medications affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"Some drugs may be linked with chances of AMD. Those include aspirin and certain heart drugs including nitroglycerin and some beta-blockers, although this isn't certain. You should talk about the use of these medications with your doctor."
190,How does high blood pressure affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"Like smoking, high blood pressure restricts the amount of oxygen getting to your eyes, which may raise your risk for AMD."
190,How can cataract surgery affect your risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,Your chances of getting AMD may go up if you've had this eye operation.
190,What causes dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"Some things that are linked to AMD are out of your control, like the genes that your parents passed down to you. The condition is linked with bits of fat and protein called drusen. They can collect under your retina -- a layer of tissue at the back of your eye that processes light. No one knows where the drusen come from, but they are thought to be pieces of waste from the retina. If you're over the age of 50 you probably have some hard drusen in your eyes. These are normal and harmless, especially if they aren't in your macula -- the small area at the center of your retina. Drusen in early AMD are quite small. They get larger as the condition moves from early to intermediate to advanced. In advanced-stage AMD, drusen are larger and more numerous. They keep oxygen from reaching your eye."
191,At what times of the day does rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affect the joints?,"For many people with RA, their joints are stiff first thing in the morning, and then ease up after at least an hour of movement. The condition usually affects more than one joint and mirrors both sides of the body."

192,How are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)?,"Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) are often used if NSAIDs don't provide enough relief. DMARDs may keep JRA from getting worse. But because they take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they're often taken with an NSAID. Methotrexate is usually the main DMARD doctors prescribe for JRA."
192,How are biologic drugs used to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)?,"Biologic drugs, which are genetically engineered, may be used in children if other drugs don't work."
192,Should juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treatment include physical therapy?,Your child's JRA treatment should include physical therapy. It helps keep their muscles strong so that their joints can move as well as possible. A physiatrist or a physical therapist can create an exercise program for your child. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth.

192,How are corticosteroids used to treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may help children with severe JRA. These drugs can help stop serious symptoms such as inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis). Doctors can give children these medicines for JRA directly into the vein, into joints, or by mouth. Steroids can hamper a child's normal growth and can cause other side effects, such as a round face, weight gain, weakened bones, and a greater chance of infection."

The process is identical to normal puberty, but happens early. The pituitary gland is prompted to produce hormones, called gonadotropins. These hormones in turn stimulate the testicles or ovaries to make other hormones, testosterone or estrogen. It's these sex hormones that cause the changes of puberty, like breast development in girls. Peripheral precocious puberty or precocious pseudo-puberty is a different condition. It's also rarer. The hormones estrogen and testosterone trigger the symptoms. But the brain and pituitary gland are not involved.

A number of studies have shown an association between obesity in young girls and an increased risk of precocious puberty. However, researchers don't know how direct the link is. Obesity does not seem to be connected to early puberty in boys."
217,What is early puberty?,"Doctors diagnose early puberty when this normal process starts early and continues to progress through growth spurts and bone maturation, usually for reasons we don't understand. Girls who show significant signs of puberty and its progression before age 8 and boys before age 9 are considered precocious. About 1 out of 5,000 children are affected.

231,Should you exercise if you have fibro fog and fatigue?,"Given how you feel, you may want to shy away from exercise. But it's one of the most effective ways to handle fibromyalgia. When you're too tired to exercise, that lack of activity leads to greater muscle weakness and more fatigue. Over time, regular exercise lessens fatigue. Consistency can have a greater impact than intensity. It's possible that exercise also creates a positive chain reaction that boosts brain function. Studies show a link between physical ability and thinking ability. People who can do more physically often do better in areas like attention and decision-making. Start out at an easy pace. Work with a physical therapist to find the right beginner program for you and adapt it as you get stronger. This is especially helpful if you're nervous about exercising.

They also do not appear to be secreted in breast milk."
238,What is the effect of surgery for Crohn's disease on pregnancy?,"Crohn's disease is a chronic illness in which the intestine, bowel, or another part of the digestive tract become inflamed and ulcerated. That happens so the body won't reject the fetus. Women who have had bowel resections (surgeries to remove part of the bowel) do not appear to have any problems during pregnancy. Women who have had ileostomies may have lower fertility rates. It may be best to wait for a year after this surgery to become pregnant in order to reduce the risk of the ileostomy dropping or becoming blocked during pregnancy. Some women with Crohn's disease develop fistulas -- abnormal passageways between organs. If you have a fistula or an abscess -- a cavity filled with pus -- that's near the rectum and vaginal area you will likely be advised to deliver your baby by cesarean section, or C-section."
238,Can pregnant women take medication for Crohn's disease?,"If a man who wants to become a father is taking sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) for Crohn's disease, he should ask his doctor to change his medication. It might, though, if you have a change in your condition. As for specific types of drugs to treat Crohn's disease, only antibiotics and methotrexate must be avoided. That's because of the harm they can do to the fetus. If you are taking sulfasalazine, you need to be particularly sure you get enough folic acid."
238,How do drugs for Crohn's disease affect pregnancy?,"That part is called the ileum. The exception is methotrexate. Methotrexate should not be taken if you are pregnant. Nor should it be taken by either a man or a woman who is trying to conceive. Methotrexate can cause the death of the fetus. It can also cause congenital abnormalities. If you are taking methotrexate, you also should not breastfeed. If you are on steroids, you should not get pregnant. If you are taking a corticosteroid such as prednisone or another steroid and do get pregnant, your doctor will prescribe the smallest possible dose. If you are breastfeeding while taking steroids in moderate to high doses, your baby should be monitored by a pediatrician. Women who have had bowel resections (surgeries to remove part of the bowel) do not appear to have any problems during pregnancy."
239,What flu-like symptoms are associated with inflammation?,"Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances."
239,What are treatment options for inflammatory diseases?,"The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms. The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease."

239,What is treatment of inflammation directed at?,"This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining and, eventually, wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones)."
239,What drugs are used to treat inflammatory diseases?,"The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ."

However, when ""chemotherapy"" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment."
239,Can inflammation affect internal organs?,Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure.
240,What are the physical signs of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"PMS shows up in many different ways. Everything in this list could be a sign of PMS. But most women get just a few of these, not all of them. Physical signs Bloated tummy Cramps Tender breasts Hunger Headache Muscle aches Joint pain Swollen hands and feet Pimples Weight gain Constipation or diarrhea Emotional signs Tense or anxious Depressed Crying Mood swings Can't sleep Don't want to be with people Feel overwhelmed or out of control Angry outbursts Behavioral signs Forget things Loss of mental focus Tired Girls and women who still get their period can get PMS."

240,What can your doctor do to help you manage premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"If you've tried different things, but still have bad PMS, it's probably time to get help. Make an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. She'll ask about your symptoms, your health, and medicines you take. She may take some blood tests to make sure the problem is PMS and not something else. Your doctor may prescribe medicine. Birth control pills sometimes help with headache and cramps. Antidepressants (medicines that help treat depression) may be an option. Some women take medicine to get rid of extra fluid that makes them feel bloated. Doctors call these diuretics (water pills). Your doctor might suggest talk therapy. It's a way to feel better and learn new skills to overcome challenges by talking with a mental health counselor. If you have notes about your symptoms, bring it to the appointment. Plan ahead about the questions you want to ask. That way you'll get the best help from your doctor."
240,Who is most likely to get premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"Physical signs Bloated tummy Cramps Tender breasts Hunger Headache Muscle aches Joint pain Swollen hands and feet Pimples Weight gain Constipation or diarrhea Emotional signs Tense or anxious Depressed Crying Mood swings Can't sleep Don't want to be with people Feel overwhelmed or out of control Angry outbursts Behavioral signs Forget things Loss of mental focus Tired Girls and women who still get their period can get PMS. But it's most common in women who: Are in their late 20s to early 40s. Have had a child. Have family members with depression. Had baby blues (postpartum depression), depression or bipolar disorder."
240,What causes premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"Even though PMS is common, doctors don't know exactly what causes it. It probably has to do with changes in your body chemistry around the time of your period. Some conditions affect PMS, but don't cause it. PMS can be brought on, or can get worse if you: Smoke Are under lots of stress Don't exercise Don't sleep enough Drink too much alcohol or eat too much salt, red meat, or sugar Are depressed Women with other health problems may find that those problems get worse before their period. Some of those are migraine headaches, asthma, and allergies."
240,What can you do to treat or manage premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"Even if you can't totally fix it, it's nice to know you have the power to help yourself. These ideas might help: Exercise about 30 minutes a day. Eat healthy foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Try to get enough calcium from foods (think dairy, green leafy vegetables, and canned salmon). Avoid salt, caffeine, and alcohol. Don't smoke. Get plenty of sleep. Work to lower stress. Track your moods and symptoms in a journal. Try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions exactly as it says on the label. Make an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist."
240,What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"You probably get some signs that your period is coming. If it messes with your daily life, you might have premenstrual syndrome ( PMS). Your period is a natural part of your life. Once your period starts, they go away. Another way to know is if you have symptoms on the 5 days before your period, for 3 months in a row. Women with PMS deal with it in lots of ways.

It probably has to do with changes in your body chemistry around the time of your period."
241,When should you call your doctor about a blister?,"The blister was caused by contact with a chemical -- or if you have an autoimmune blistering disease. Other reasons to seek medical advice is if you have multiple blisters, or they progress in number and location, or if you can't figure out why you are getting them."
241,What's a blister and what symptoms can it bring on?,"A blister is a bubble of skin filled with clear fluid, ranging from pinpoint size to more than an inch in diameter. They are different than pustules, which contain thicker, yellow-white material called pus. Depending on the cause, blistering may be accompanied by pain, redness, or itching."
242,How do I know if my plastic baby bottles have BPA in them?,"The ban on BPA means you can confidently buy new plastic baby bottles, knowing that they are free of the potentially harmful chemical. If you are using older plastic bottles, for example bottles given to you by family members, check the recycling symbol on the bottom. The symbol #7 or the label PC (which stands for polycarbonate) is a sign that the bottle likely contains BPA. Bottles with the symbol #1, #2, or #4 are made of polyethylene, and #5 bottles are made of polypropylene. Both kinds of bottle can be used safely since neither type contains BPA."
242,What are some tips on caring for baby bottles?,"Here are some tips on caring for your child's baby bottle: Never store breast milk or formula in plastic bottles. Pour it into the bottle just before your baby is ready to eat. Throw out anything that is left over. Don't use hot water or a harsh cleaner on polycarbonate bottles, because this also can cause the plastic to break down more quickly. Instead, use a gentle cleaner and warm water. Replace any glass bottles that have cracks or chips in them."
243,What triggers tinnitus?,"Triggers may include: Age-related hearing loss Loud noises like concerts, sporting events, machinery, or backfiring engines Sinus pressure from sinus or ear infections, cold, flu, or allergies Too much earwax Certain medications like aspirin, some antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Migraines and other headaches High blood pressure and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Jaw problems Other medical issues like head and neck injuries, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, changes in your inner ear bones, and an inner ear disorder called Meniere's disease."
243,What are other treatment options for tinnitus?,"Other treatment options may include: Hearing aids. These devices can help with age-related hearing loss and tinnitus. They make the sounds you need to hear louder and make the ringing harder to notice. Sound maskers. You wear them in or behind your ear to create constant low-level white noise. This helps block the ringing. You might also try a white noise machine near your bed at night to help you sleep. Retraining therapy. You get counseling and wear a gadget that masks the ringing with tonal music. Relaxation techniques. Tinnitus can get worse when you're stressed. You might find ways to ease your worries, like exercise, deep breathing, or biofeedback. Medicines. There are several medications that show some promise in treating tinnitus, including certain hormones, topical anesthetics, and anti-anxiety medication. Ask your doctor if any of them may be right for you."
243,Is there a treatment for tinnitus?,"It depends on what's to blame for the ringing. If a medication is the trigger, your doctor might suggest you stop taking it or change to a different drug. Never stop a medicine on your own without talking to your doctor first. If a health issue like high blood pressure is the cause, your doctor can work with you to treat it. Often the ringing will improve when you get the condition under control. If the problem is too much earwax, the doctor can remove the buildup gently. Don't use cotton swabs to try to do it yourself."
243,How is tinnitus diagnosed?,"Your doctor will discuss your medical history. He'll ask about any medicines you take, including supplements. He'll do a hearing test, examine your head and neck, and look inside your ears. He might ask you to clench your jaw, move your eyes, and move your neck, arms, and legs. If the ringing gets worse when you move, that may help find a cause for it. You may also need imaging tests like CT or MRI scans."
243,What does tinnitus sound like?,Do you hear ringing in your ears when there isn't any sound around you? You might hear it all the time or it might come and go.
244,What are the warning signs of suicide due to bipolar disorder?,"People who also have a substance abuse problem may need more specialized treatment. Some people who have bipolar disorder may become suicidal. Learn the warning signs and seek immediate medical help for them: Depression (changes in eating, sleeping, activities) Isolating yourself Talking about suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Acting recklessly Taking more risks Having more accidents Abusing alcohol or other drugs Focusing on morbid and negative themes Talking about death and dying Crying more, or becoming less emotionally expressive Giving away possessions"
244,What are the symptoms of mania from bipolar disorder?,"Symptoms of mania (""the highs""): Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile Restlessness Rapid speech and poor concentration Increased energy and less need for sleep Unusually high sex drive Making grand and unrealistic plans Showing poor judgment Drug and alcohol abuse Becoming more impulsive During depressive periods (""the lows""), a person with bipolar disorder may have: Sadness Loss of energy Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not enjoying things they once liked Trouble concentrating Uncontrollable crying Trouble making decisions Irritability Needing more sleep Insomnia Appetite changes that make them lose or gain weight Thoughts of death or suicide Attempting suicide When someone develops bipolar disorder, it usually starts when they're in late adolescence or young adulthood."
244,What does hypomania bipolar disorder mean?,"Hypomania"" describes milder symptoms of mania, in which someone does not have delusions or hallucinations, and their high symptoms do not interfere with their everyday life."
244,What are the symptoms of depressive periods in bipolar disorder?,"Symptoms of mania (""the highs""): Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile Restlessness Rapid speech and poor concentration Increased energy and less need for sleep Unusually high sex drive Making grand and unrealistic plans Showing poor judgment Drug and alcohol abuse Becoming more impulsive During depressive periods (""the lows""), a person with bipolar disorder may have: Sadness Loss of energy Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not enjoying things they once liked Trouble concentrating Uncontrollable crying Trouble making decisions Irritability Needing more sleep Insomnia Appetite changes that make them lose or gain weight Thoughts of death or suicide Attempting suicide When someone develops bipolar disorder, it usually starts when they're in late adolescence or young adulthood."
244,What can I expect after bipolar disorder treatment?,Ongoing treatment is more effective than dealing with problems as they come up. People who also have a substance abuse problem may need more specialized treatment.
244,What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?,"In bipolar disorder, the dramatic episodes of high and low moods do not follow a set pattern. Someone may feel the same mood state (depressed or manic) several times before switching to the opposite mood. These episodes can happen over a period of weeks, months, and sometimes even years. How severe it gets differs from person to person and can also change over time, becoming more or less severe."
244,How is bipolar disorder treated?,"Bipolar disorder can be treated. It's a long-term condition that needs ongoing care. Medication is the main treatment, usually involving ""mood stabilizers"" such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal), lithium, or valproate ( Depakote). Sometimes antipsychotic drugs are also used such as olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), lurasidone ( Latuda) and cariprazine ( Vraylar)), as well as antidepressants. Combinations of medicines are often used. Psychotherapy, or ""talk therapy,"" is often recommended, too. People who have four or more mood episodes in a year, or who also have drug or alcohol problems, can have forms of the illness that are much harder to treat."
244,How is bipolar disorder diagnosed?,"You can think of the highs and the lows as two ""poles"" of mood, which is why it's called ""bipolar"" disorder. How severe it gets differs from person to person and can also change over time, becoming more or less severe. If you or someone you know has symptoms of bipolar disorder, talk to your family doctor or a psychiatrist. They will ask questions about mental illnesses that you, or the person you're concerned about, have had, and any mental illnesses that run in the family. How long have they lasted? How often do they happen? The most telling symptoms are those that involve highs or lows in mood, along with changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior. Talking to close friends and family of the person can often help the doctor distinguish bipolar disorder from major depressive (unipolar) disorder or other psychiatric disorders that can involve changes in mood, thinking, and behavior."
245,What happens during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat bipolar disorder?,"Prior to ECT treatment, a person is given a muscle relaxant and put under general anesthesia. Electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp, and an electric current is applied that causes a brief seizure. Because the muscles are relaxed, the seizure will usually be limited to slight movement of the hands and feet. The patient is carefully monitored during the treatment. The patient awakens minutes later, does not remember the treatment or events surrounding the treatment, and may be briefly confused."
246,What should I look for when I shop for baby clothes?,"To make your final selection, though, you need to consider safety, comfort, and practicality -- easy to put on and washable. And you probably want to consider the price, too. It's OK to shop in secondhand stores or high-quality consignment shops for most things for babies. Just be sure to wash everything first. Safety first: no buttons, bows, or ties. Stay away from clothes with small buttons, decorative rhinestones, or bows, because they can be choking risks. Clothes with long ties or that pull tightly around your baby's arms, legs, or neck are also unsafe."
246,How do I know if my baby's clothes are fire-safe?,"Labels on your baby's sleepwear will tell you whether it needs to be worn snugly to be fire-retardant or if the fabric itself is flame-retardant. But be aware: Scientists haven't closely studied the long-term health effects of the chemicals that make fabrics fire-resistant. Some research has linked some of these chemicals to health problems, including delayed physical and mental development, thyroid trouble, and problems with mental activities like thinking and memory."
246,How can I make my shopping for baby clothes easier?,"Follow these tips when you're shopping for clothes to make it easier. Wide necks or snaps at the neck make dressing easier. ( If you pick clothes that pull over the head, do it quickly because babies panic when their breathing is blocked or when they can't see you.) Snaps and zippers in the front are easier to put on and take off than those on the back. Loose sleeves pull on and off easier than tight ones. Snaps or other easy openings at the crotch make it quicker and easier to change diapers -- you don't have to take off all of your baby's clothes."
246,Should I shop for baby clothes by age or weight?,"Shop by your baby's weight, not age. Age doesn't mean much when it comes to baby clothes. Different brands size clothing differently. Weight is a better measure, and many baby clothes list it along with age on their labels."
247,What are your chances of survival when prostate cancer spreads?,"If it's caught and treated in this point, which is known as ""regional"" stage, your odds or recovery are very good. If it travels further, the cancer usually ends up in your bones. At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. Your doctor will talk to you about your best treatment options. What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. You may have already had surgery or radiation. Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate."
247,How is prostate cancer treated once it has spread to my bones?,"If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals."
247,How should you take care of yourself if you have prostate cancer?,"Self-care is also important: Take naps to fight fatigue and try to do some light exercise, like walking, to keep your energy levels up. Being active can also help combat weight gain, especially if you add some strength training to your routine. Check with your doctor first to make sure it's safe for you to exercise. He may suggest you work with a physical therapist."
247,How can prostate cancer affect your daily life?,"Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate. Loss of bladder control (incontinence), fatigue, and erectile dysfunction often go hand-in-hand with treatment. Men who have hormonal therapy may have hot flashes (similar to what many women have during menopause) or gain weight. Cancer that has spread to your bones can also be painful."
247,What are my treatment options once my prostate cancer spreads?,"When this type of cancer spreads (your doctor may say it has metastasized), it tends to first show up in the tissues or lymph nodes that are closest to the prostate gland. That usually means taking medication to lower the amount of androgen hormones (testosterone and DHT) in your body or prevent them from affecting cancer cells. A related but rarely used option is surgical castration. The doctor removes your testicles, where most of these hormones are made. If you don't like the idea of losing them, the doctor can fit you with silicone sacs to insert into your scrotum. They'll preserve the look and feel. If hormone therapy doesn't work, you might move on to vaccine therapy. The prostate cancer vaccine is designed to kick-start your immune system so it attacks cancer cells. Or your doctor might suggest chemotherapy. It might be a medication you take by mouth, or something your doctor injects into a vein. Men who have hormonal therapy may have hot flashes (similar to what many women have during menopause) or gain weight."
247,What should you expect when prostate cancer spreads?,"At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. You might think you'd know it if your cancer has spread, but that's not always true."
247,What are some signs of trouble with prostate cancer?,"What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. This is why your follow-up doctor visits are important. You're most likely to find out the cancer has spread if your doctor tests your blood and finds high levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. He might also find it with a digital rectal exam or on an X-ray or other test. If you do have symptoms, they often include trouble peeing or blood in your urine. You might also feel very tired, short of breath, or lose weight without trying. You're more likely to feel pain if the cancer has gone into your bones. Where it hurts will depend on which bones it affects. For instance, you might feel hip or back pain if cancer has spread into your pelvic bones."
248,What does purging mean in regard to stem cells?,purging: The process of separating cancer cells from bone marrow or stem cells.

248,What are antibodies?,antibodies: Proteins made by your body that fight off foreign substances.
249,How can strep throat easily spread?,The bacteria that cause strep are highly contagious. You can spread it by close contact -- including sneezes and handshakes -- or sharing someone else's personal items. Be sure to wash your hands often and be cautious about touching objects when someone in your house has strep.
249,What tests are used for strep throat?,"Your doctor tests for strep throat with a rapid antigen test. She swabs the back of your throat with a cotton-tipped stick to get a sample. You usually get results in about 20 minutes. If the test is negative (meaning no signs of strep are found), the doctor may do what's called a throat culture. She'll take more swab samples from the back of your throat and send them to a lab. You may have to wait a couple of days for those results."
249,When should I see a doctor about strep throat?,"For your little ones, call the doctor right away if: An infant is 12 weeks or younger and has a temperature of 100.4 F or higher A fever goes above 104 F in any child You should also contact her if: A child younger than 2 has a fever lasting more than 24 hours A child 2 or older has a fever for more than 72 hours Your doctor will ask questions and do tests to find out whether you have strep or something else."
249,What causes strep throat?,"Another culprit, especially in children and young adults, is the bacteria that creates strep throat. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) is the formal name of the bacterium. These are usually signs of a virus or allergy."
249,What do you need when you visit a doctor for strep throat?,"When you have strep, you'll usually find that your throat is quite raw and it really hurts to swallow. You should call your doctor if you or a child in your care show any symptoms of strep or you see this rash."
249,How can you treat strep throat?,"But how can you tell if it's strep and not something else? You'll find that it comes on very fast, not gradually like many other kinds of sore throats. You might also see a red, sandpaper-like rash that starts in the face and neck area and then spreads to the rest of the body.

262,How is lupus nephritis treated?,"There are five different types of lupus nephritis. Treatment is based on the type of lupus nephritis, which is determined by the biopsy. Since symptoms and severity vary from person to person, treatments are individually tailored to meet a person's particular circumstances. Medications used in treatment can include: Corticosteroids. These strong anti-inflammatory drugs can decrease inflammation. Doctors may prescribe these until the lupus nephritis improves. Because these drugs can cause a variety of potentially serious side effects, they must be monitored carefully. Doctors generally taper down the dosage once the symptoms start to improve. Immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs, which are related to the ones used to treat cancer or prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, work by suppressing immune system activity that damages the kidneys. They include cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan), azathioprine ( Imuran) and mycophenolate ( Cellcept). Medications to prevent blood clots or lower blood pressure if needed Even with treatment, loss of kidney function sometimes progresses."
262,What happens if treatment of lupus nephritis does not stop loss of kidney function?,"Medications to prevent blood clots or lower blood pressure if needed Even with treatment, loss of kidney function sometimes progresses. If both kidneys fail, people with lupus nephritis may need dialysis. Dialysis involves filtering the blood through a machine to remove waste products from the body. Ultimately, it may be necessary to have a kidney transplant. In those cases, people will need additional drugs to keep their immune system from rejecting the transplanted kidney."
262,How is lupus nephritis diagnosed?,"The diagnosis of lupus nephritis begins with a medical history, physical exam, and evaluation of symptoms. You doctor will likely order tests to make or confirm a diagnosis. Tests used in diagnosing kidney problems include urine tests, blood tests, imaging tests such as ultrasound, and kidney biopsy."

262,What is lupus nephritis?,"Lupus nephritis is inflammation of the kidney that is caused by systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE). With lupus, the body's immune system targets its own body tissues. Lupus nephritis happens when lupus involves the kidneys. Up to 60% of lupus patients will develop lupus nephritis. When the kidneys are inflamed, they can't function normally and can leak protein. If not controlled, lupus nephritis can lead to kidney failure. Treatment is based on the type of lupus nephritis, which is determined by the biopsy."

While studies of omega-3 fatty acids for mood symptoms are not conclusive, some experts believe that they may be helpful in some people with bipolar disorder, particularly if they have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease or high triglycerides. Some research suggests that getting more omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil is linked to greater volume in areas of the brain. In particular, these areas are related to mood and behavior. In one study of 75 patients, one of the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids was decreasing depression in bipolar disorder. Still, the overall evidence for benefit of fish oil in bipolar disorder is inconsistent. More studies are needed before fish oil can be recommended as a proven treatment for bipolar disorder.

It's usually a symptom of an underlying condition, most often an infection. Fever is usually associated with physical discomfort, and most people feel better when a fever is treated. But depending on your age, physical condition, and the underlying cause of your fever, you may or may not require medical treatment for the fever alone. Many experts believe that fever is a natural bodily defense against infection. There are also many non-infectious causes of fever. Fever is generally not considered dangerous, but hyperthermia can cause dangerous rises in body temperature. This can be due to an extreme temperature associated with heat injury such as heat stroke, side effects of certain medications or illicit drugs, and stroke. With hyperthermia, the body is no longer able to control body temperature. In children with fever, accompanying symptoms such as lethargy, fussiness, poor appetite, sore throat, cough, ear pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are important to relay to your doctor."

Besides a physical exam, your doctor will ask about symptoms and conditions, medications, and if you've recently traveled to areas with infections or have other infection risks. A malaria infection, for example, may be have a fever that typically recurs. Some areas of the U. S. are hotspots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Sometimes, you may have a ""fever of unknown origin."" In such cases, the cause could be an unusual or not obvious condition such as a chronic infection, a connective tissue disorder, cancer, or another problem."
284,What causes a fever?,"A part of the brain called the hypothalamus controls body temperature, which usually varies throughout the day from the normal temperature of 98.6 F. In response to an infection, illness, or some other cause, the hypothalamus may reset the body to a higher temperature."

285,How can counseling help with panic attacks?,"The treatment may begin with âtalk therapy.â You'll sit down with a counselor who can help you understand what panic disorder is and how you can manage it. As your treatment continues, therapy should help you figure out the situations, thoughts, or feelings that cause your attacks. Once you understand what's happening, those triggers have less power to cause trouble. Counseling should also show you that the attacks' physical effects don't actually hurt you. With your therapist, you'll work through your symptoms in a safe, gradual way until they seem less scary. That also can help make the attacks go away. You'll also learn relaxation techniques that can help you handle attacks when they do happen. If you can control your breathing, for instance, that may make a panic attack less severe. It might also make the next one less likely. You have to practice these skills regularly in your daily life to get the benefit."
285,What dietary supplements can help with panic attacks?,"As for dietary supplements, there's not enough research showing that they work to reduce panic attacks. One, called inositol, showed some promise in small studies, but it's too soon to know how well it works. Be sure to check with your doctor before trying any supplements, because they could have side effects or conflict with medication."

Take a less direct route into the house. Any extra movement counts.
286,How intense does my exercise for diabetes need to be?,"Diabetes and Exercise: Ideas to Get You Moving Best Diabetes Exercises Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, just about any activity that gets your heart rate up or builds strength is a good idea. Anything from line dancing to table tennis can work."
286,How much strength training do I need if I have diabetes and why?,"2 to 3 sessions of strength training each week. The more muscle mass you have, the better your body can process blood sugar.

286,Why is it important for diabetics to stay hydrated while exercising?,"You lose water when you exercise, and that can upset your blood sugar levels. Make sure to drink water before, during, and after exercise to make up for what you lose. This is even more important if have nerve damage from diabetes. Talk to your doctor about the best fluids to drink while exercising, especially if you take insulin or a drug that can lower your blood sugar."
286,How can I start exercising if I have diabetes and haven't exercised before?,"Diabetes and Exercise: Ideas to Get You Moving Diabetes and Exercise: Getting Started Start slowly. If you haven't exercised in a while, begin with just 5 to 10 minutes a day. Build up by adding a few minutes or repetitions each week."

287,"How do clinical trials that use ""personalized"" medicine work?","Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location. They might choose only people with stage IV lung cancer, for instance. But now that there's personalized medicine, researchers need new ways to study how targeted treatments work on a variety of cancers. Basket trials combine folks with many different cancer types into a single âbasketâ and use a precision medicine approach to find treatments that work. So a single trial could include people on many different drugs."
287,What's involved in the process of creating personalized cancer treatments?,"Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location. They might choose only people with stage IV lung cancer, for instance.

Basket trials combine folks with many different cancer types into a single âbasketâ and use a precision medicine approach to find treatments that work. So a single trial could include people on many different drugs."
287,What role do genes play in personal medicine for cancer?,"For years, cancer treatment was a cookie-cutter process. You'd have surgery to remove a tumor, then chemotherapy or radiation to kill cancer cells. But blasting cancers with chemotherapy or radiation kills healthy cells as well, which can lead to a host of nasty side effects. Now, researchers can examine your cancer cells and learn the order of the genes in their DNA. While most cells in your body have identical genes, the ones in cancer cells have mutations, or changes. This is what allows them to grow into tumors. What's more, your cancer may have different genetic changes than someone else's. Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. This makes the need for personalized medicine even greater."
287,What is personalized medicine for cancer?,"It's likely you've seen terms like âpersonalized medicine,â âprecision medicine,â or âtargeted drugs.â What are these things? It uses information about you and your tumor to figure out what's driving the disease and create a plan just for you."
287,How are patients matched with personal medicines for cancer?,"Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. They include imatinib ( Gleevec), a drug used on chronic myelogenous leukemia, and the breast cancer drug trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Tumor genetics can also tell doctors which drugs won't work. For example, if your colon cancer has a genetic mutation called KRAS, doctors won't give you two common colon cancer drugs because they know they won't work. Many clinical centers do something called tumor profiling. Your doctor takes a look at your tumor's genes. If he thinks your cancer may have specific mutations, he might start you on a specific drug that is tailored for the genetic mutation found in your cancer cells. For instance, if you have breast cancer, a genetic test would tell him if Herceptin might work for you. Profiling can also help if other treatment options, like chemotherapy, haven't worked for you. A genetic mutation might point your medical team toward an unexpected drug, like one originally designed for another type of cancer."

289,What are side effects of raloxifene?,"Because of its anti-estrogen effects, the most common side effects with raloxifene are hot flashes. Conversely, because of its estrogenic effects, raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots, including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) and pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung). Studies show that the risk of blood clots over a five year period is less than 1% for women who did not have a history of blood clots. Patients taking raloxifene should avoid tobacco use and prolonged periods of immobility during travel, when blood clots are more prone to occur."
289,What health problems does the drug Duavee treat?,"Another SERM combination drug, bazedoxifene-conjugated estrogen ( Duavee) is FDA-approved to reduce hot flashes and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women."
289,What is raloxifene (Evista)?,"It is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to reduce risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk or with osteoporosis. SERMs were developed to reap the benefits of estrogen while avoiding the hormone's potential side effects. Raloxifene, a so-called ''designer'' estrogen, can act like estrogen on bone -- protecting its density -- but as an anti-estrogen on the lining of the uterus."
290,What can I take if I have bad side effects in my diabetic nephropathy medication?,"If a person has side effects from taking ACE inhibitors, another class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs) can often be given instead."

294,What are tests to diagnose atherosclerosis?,Diseases caused by atherosclerosis are the most common cause of death in the U. S. The one test that can directly show blocked arteries is called angiography. It's an invasive test: A thin tube is put inside an artery in the leg or arm. It's then threaded through the body's maze of branching arteries. Injected dye shows arteries -- and any blockages -- on a monitor.
294,How does an electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) help in diagnosing =?,Electron beam computed tomography ( EBCT): A special CT scanner ( CAT scan) snaps pictures of the heart. A computer figures out the amount of calcium in your heart's arteries. More calcium can mean more atherosclerosis.
294,How does angiography help in diagnosing atherosclerosis?,"Angiography: This test can show a picture of blockages caused by atherosclerosis. It can be done on arteries in your heart, brain, or legs. Because it has some risk, angiography is usually done only on people with symptoms from their atherosclerosis. Typically, this means people with symptoms of blockages, such as chest pain."
294,How does a stress test help in diagnosing atherosclerosis?,"Once your doctor has identified your risk group, more tests may be needed, such as: Stress test: With medicines or walking on an exercise treadmill, your heart is made to pump almost as hard as it can. That allows your doctor to see what symptoms you may have. If needed, images of the heart or EKGs can show any blockages."
295,How can your eating habits affect swallowing problems?,Amount and rate Eat slowly. Cut food into small pieces and chew it thoroughly. Chew food until it becomes liquid in your mouth before swallowing. Do not try to eat more than 1/2 teaspoon of food at a time.

295,What diseases can cause swallowing problems?,"A wide range of diseases can cause swallowing problems, which your doctor may call ""dysphagia."" These include: Disturbances of the brain such as those caused by Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease) Oral or pharynx muscle dysfunction such as from a stroke Loss of sphincter muscle relaxation (termed ""achalasia"") Esophageal narrowing such as from acid reflux or tumors Under normal circumstances, people rarely choke during a meal."
295,What can you do to make more saliva?,"Saliva management Drink plenty of fluids. Periodically suck on Popsicles, ice chips or lemon ice, or drink lemon-flavored water to increase saliva production, which will increase swallowing frequency."
295,How do I know if I have a swallowing problem?,"These include: Disturbances of the brain such as those caused by Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease) Oral or pharynx muscle dysfunction such as from a stroke Loss of sphincter muscle relaxation (termed ""achalasia"") Esophageal narrowing such as from acid reflux or tumors Under normal circumstances, people rarely choke during a meal. Occasionally, food will stick in the esophagus for a few seconds (especially solid foods), but will pass spontaneously or can be washed down easily with liquids. But there are a number of symptoms that you should get checked for a possible swallowing problem, including: Frequent choking on food Hesitancy in food passage for more than a few seconds Pain when swallowing Recurring pneumonia (an indication that food may be going into the lungs rather than the esophagus) Immediate medical attention is needed when food becomes lodged in the esophagus for more than 15 minutes and doesn't pass spontaneously or with liquids."
295,What can I do to help with swallowing problems?,Remain sitting upright or standing for 15 to 20 minutes after eating a meal.
295,What are the phases of swallowing?,"The act of swallowing normally happens in three phases. The food is thrust from the oral cavity into the throat (pharynx). At the same time, two other things happen: A muscular valve at the bottom of the pharynx opens, allowing food to enter the esophagus, and other muscles close the airway (trachea) to prevent food from entering the airways. The third phase starts when food enters the esophagus. As the esophagus contracts, a muscular valve at the end of the esophagus opens and food is propelled into the stomach."
296,How do doctors diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome?,"The doctor may focus on your wrist to see if the area is tender, swollen, warm, or discolored. He'll probably test each finger to see if you've lost any feeling. And he'll check the strength of the muscles in your hand. After that, he may do or order any of the following tests. They'll focus on the median nerve, which runs through your forearm into your hand. When that nerve gets pressed or squeezed through the carpal tunnel, it causes carpal tunnel syndrome."
296,How can a nerve conduction velocity test help in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome?,"This test provides some of the strongest evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. It measures how fast an electric signal can travel along a nerve or from the nerve to a muscle. The doctor places a small electrode on your skin near your elbow. It sends a mild electrical current down your median nerve. The more time it takes for the current to travel from your elbow to your fingers, the more damage to your median nerve."
297,What should you know about menopause and weight gain?,"It may seem that way, especially because gaining weight is so common after menopause.

If you now have a waist measurement of more than 35 inches, it's time to take steps to reverse this trend."
297,What is the impact of estrogen on weight gain and menopause?,"With lower estrogen levels, lab animals tend to eat more and be less physically active. Reduced estrogen may also lower metabolic rate, the rate at which the body converts stored energy into working energy. It's possible the same thing happens with women when estrogen levels drop after menopause. Some evidence suggests that estrogen hormone therapy increases a woman's resting metabolic rate. This might help slow weight gain. Lack of estrogen may also cause the body to use starches and blood sugar less effectively, which would increase fat storage and make it harder to lose weight."
297,"What are other benefits of exercise, besides helping with weight gain after menopause?","Exercise has many other perks aside from weight loss, including: Lower risk of osteoporosis Lower risks of metabolic syndrome, heart attack, and other cardiovascular diseases Improved insulin resistance Keeps joints and muscles strong Helps bowels work well Relieves depression and anxiety Improves overall health What types of exercise can best help you lose and maintain weight after menopause?"

297,What are good exercise choices for weight gain after menopause?,"Here's what you need to know about the risks of weight gain and how exercise can help you lose weight and keep it off after menopause. Strength training, or a weight-resistance exercise program, helps build muscle mass and improve metabolism. Strength training also helps you maintain bone mass. Because you lose muscle mass as you age, add strength training to your workouts, if you haven't before. Aim for two or three times a week. Examples of strength training include weight machines, dumbbells, exercise bands, yoga, and gardening. Low-impact aerobics are good for your heart and lungs. Walking, for example, is one of the best choices, because you can do it anywhere, anytime. Other examples of aerobic exercises include swimming, cycling, aerobics, tennis, and dance. Exercise moderately for at least 30 minutes most, if not all, days of the week. Whenever you can, add activity to your day. Wash the car, play hide and seek with your kids or grandchildren, get in a game of ping pong, etc."

People also take glutathione to try to treat weakened immune systems or infertility, as well as many other conditions. In a small study (40 subjects), glutathione administered intravenously was found to improve pain-free walking distance. In fact, taking glutathione by mouth does not appear to be an effective way to get it into your body. In one study, giving healthy people 500 milligrams twice a day for a month didn't raise the level of glutathione in their blood. Some other studies looking at its health effects have used it in injection form or as a treatment inhaled into the lungs."

303,How does direct family history increase the risk for breast cancer?,"Having a mother, sister, or daughter (""first-degree"" relative) who has breast cancer puts a woman at higher risk for the disease. The risk is even greater if this relative developed breast cancer before menopause and had cancer in both breasts. Having one first-degree relative with breast cancer approximately doubles a woman's risk, and having two first-degree relatives triples her risk. Having a male blood relative with breast cancer will also increase a woman's risk of the disease."

303,How does weight increase my risk for breast cancer?,"Longer lifetime exposure to endogenous (your own) estrogen increases your risk, such as starting to menstruate before age 12, starting menopause after age 55, and never having had a pregnancy."
303,How does age increase the risk for breast cancer?,"Age. Your risk for breast cancer increases as you age. About 80% of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year are ages 45 or older, and about 43% are ages 65 or above. Consider this: In women ages 40 to 50, there is a one in 68 risk of developing breast cancer. From ages 50 to 60, that risk increases to one in 42. In the 60 to 70 age group, the risk is one in 28.

Some studies have suggested that women who are using birth control pills have a very slight increased risk of developing breast cancer. That risk disappears after stopping them for 10 years or more. Still other studies show no relation. More research is under way to confirm these findings. Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast cancer."
303,How many people will be diagnosed with breast cancer?,"In 2015 (the latest year for which statistics are available), the risk was just over 12% -- or more than one in 8. In many cases, it's not known why a woman gets breast cancer. A woman with a history of cancer in one breast, such as ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) or invasive breast cancer, is three to four times likelier to develop a new breast cancer, unrelated to the first one, in either the other breast or in another part of the same breast."

304,What are herniated or slipped discs and how can they cause back pain?,"If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear."
304,How common is lower back pain?,"If you're having pain, it's important to figure out why. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back."
304,Can lower back pain be caused by other things that are going on in your body?,"Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Other issues: Low back pain can also happen because of things like: Kidney stones Endometriosis, a buildup of uterine tissue outside the uterus Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread muscle pain"
304,How can stress lead to lower back pain?,And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip.
305,What are the goals of treatment for Parkinson's disease?,"Your health care team should include: Neurologists Occupational therapists Physical therapists Counselors Social workers Speech therapists Registered dietitians The goals of treatment vary for each person, but in most cases, treatment for Parkinson's disease is designed to: Maintain overall quality of life Improve mobility and function Reduce rigidity Reduce tremor Reverse slowed movements Improve posture, gait, balance, speech, and writing skills Maintain mental sharpness Most people with Parkinson's disease can be treated using prescribed medications."
305,Which health care professionals can be part of your medical team if you have Parkinson's disease?,"Treating Parkinson's disease is often a ""team effort"" involving not only your neurologist but also a wide variety of specialists. Your health care team should include: Neurologists Occupational therapists Physical therapists Counselors Social workers Speech therapists Registered dietitians The goals of treatment vary for each person, but in most cases, treatment for Parkinson's disease is designed to: Maintain overall quality of life Improve mobility and function Reduce rigidity Reduce tremor Reverse slowed movements Improve posture, gait, balance, speech, and writing skills Maintain mental sharpness Most people with Parkinson's disease can be treated using prescribed medications."
306,What can I do if I'm embarrassed about having rosacea?,"If your symptoms are seriously affecting your mood and self-esteem, do something about it. Treatment for your rosacea symptoms is key. You could also ask your doctor about using makeup to hide affected patches of skin. If you're stressed or depressed, you might get help from counseling or medications. Never ignore signs of anxiety or depression. Talk to your doctor right away so that you can get help."
307,Why is it important to give your child a sense of control over bedwetting to help minimize the negative emotional effects of it?,"There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope. First, work with your child to create and keep a bedwetting calendar or journal. Your child can recognize dry nights with stars and even come up with different hypotheses to test. For instance, they might decide to test whether limiting soda in the evening helps minimize bedwetting occurrences and keep track of it in their bedwetting journal. You can also encourage your child to visualize his bladder filling up overnight and imagine himself waking up to use the bathroom when he needs to urinate."
308,Where is a bone biopsy done and will I be awake during it?,"A bone biopsy can be done at a hospital or your doctor's office. Before the test, you'll get medicine to prevent pain and help you relax or sleep. During the biopsy, nurses will check your heartbeat and blood pressure."
308,What will bone biopsy results tell me?,"A biopsy can find out whether you have a tumor in your bone, and if that tumor is cancer. The doctor who ordered the test will explain what your results mean."
308,Why do I need blood tests before a bone biopsy test?,"Before the procedure, let her know if you: Take any medicines or supplements -- even over-the-counter medications Are allergic to pain medicine, latex, or tape Are pregnant Have bleeding problems or take blood thinners You might have blood tests to make sure you're healthy enough for the test. Your doctor will ask you to stop taking blood thinners a few days before the biopsy. Take your other medicines with a sip of water on the morning of the test. Don't eat or drink anything 8 hours beforehand."
308,What happens during a needle bone biopsy?,"Before the test, you'll get medicine to prevent pain and help you relax or sleep. Then the doctor places the needle into the bone to take out the sample. She uses a very thin one in a fine needle biopsy to remove a small sample of cells or tissue. She uses a larger one to get a bigger piece of bone in a core needle biopsy. You might feel some pressure when the needle goes in and the sample is taken out. A bandage is placed over the area to stop the bleeding."
308,What happens during an open bone biopsy?,"Before the test, you'll get medicine to prevent pain and help you relax or sleep. The doctor makes a small cut in your skin over the bone and removes a piece of it. She closes the hole in your skin with stitches or tape strips."
308,What are bone biopsy tests used for?,These tests can show whether you have cancer or another problem. It can help your doctor diagnose you and find the right treatment.
309,How do I get infected with E. coli?,"You can become infected when you swallow even a small amount of E. coli bacteria. Among the ways this can happen: Ground meat: You eat ground meat that carries E. coli, and the meat wasn't cooked enough to kill the bacteria. When meat is processed, sometimes bacteria from the animals' intestines make their way into the meat. This happens more with ground meat because it comes from more than one animal. Untreated milk: You drink unpasteurized milk, which hasn't been heated to kill bacteria. E. coli can get into the milk from the cow's udder or from milking equipment. Vegetables and fruit: You might eat fresh vegetables or fruit that's been tainted by water that has the bacteria. This happens most often when manure from nearby animals mixes with the water supply. Other foods and beverages: You might also get E. coli from unpasteurized fruit juices and yogurt and cheese made from raw milk. Water: You swallow water that contains E. coli, perhaps while swimming in a pool, lake, or pond. Other people: You might get E. coli from another person who has it, such as a child. The bacteria can be passed to you if you clean up after an infected person and then don't wash your hands really well before you touch your mouth. Animals: It can be found at petting zoos or animal exhibits at fairs."
309,How can I prevent E. coli infection?,"After you've used the bathroom or changed a diaper After you've had contact with animals, even your own pets After handling raw meat You can also prevent E. coli infections by being careful about the foods that carry the greatest chance of contamination: Cook hamburgers until they're 160 F inside. Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, and cider. Wash all of your produce before you eat it. Be especially careful to get dirt off leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach. In your kitchen, a couple of simple rules will help keep you safe: Wash: Clean knives, counters, and cutting boards with hot, soapy water after raw meat has touched them. Keep raw and cooked separate: Use different cutting boards for food that you eat raw, such as vegetables and fruit. Don't put cooked meat back on the same plate you used for raw meat without washing the plate first. When you're swimming, try not to swallow the water, whether it's a pool, a lake, or the ocean. It may be tainted."
309,How can E. coli make me sick?,"While many of us associate E. coli with food poisoning, you can also get pneumonia and urinary tract infections from different types of the bacteria. In fact, 75% to 95% of urinary tract infections are caused by E. coli. Some versions of E. coli make you sick by making a toxin called Shiga. This toxin damages the lining of your intestine. The strains of E. coli that make the toxin are sometimes called STEC, which is short for â Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.â One especially bad strain, O157: H7, can make you very sick. It causes abdominal cramps, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. It is the leading cause of acute kidney failure in children. It can also cause life-threatening symptoms such as: Adult kidney failure Fever Bleeding Confusion Seizures You should get emergency help if you have any of these symptoms."
309,When should I wash my hands to prevent E. coli infection?,"After you've used the bathroom or changed a diaper After you've had contact with animals, even your own pets After handling raw meat You can also prevent E. coli infections by being careful about the foods that carry the greatest chance of contamination: Cook hamburgers until they're 160 F inside. Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, and cider. Wash all of your produce before you eat it."
309,How is E. coli infection treated?,"The only way your doctor can know for sure if you have an E. coli infection is to send a sample of your stool to a lab to be analyzed. Fortunately, the infection usually goes away on its own. For some types of E.coli associated with diarrhea, such as the watery travelers' diarrhea, antibiotics can shorten the length of time you have symptoms and might be used in moderately severe cases. But if you have fever or bloody diarrhea or if your doctor suspects Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, antibiotics should not be taken. They can actually increase the production of Shiga toxin and worsen your symptoms. It's important to rest and get plenty of fluids to replace what your body is losing through vomiting or diarrhea. Don't take over-the-counter medications that fight diarrhea. You don't want to slow down your digestive system, because that will delay your body's shedding of the infection."
309,What food should I eat after E. coli infection?,"When you start to feel better, stick to low-fiber foods at first such as: Crackers Toast Eggs Rice Dairy products and foods that are high in fat or fiber can make your symptoms worse."
309,What are the symptoms of E. coli infection?,"This happens more with ground meat because it comes from more than one animal. You'll probably start to feel ill 2 to 5 days after you've taken in the E. coli bacteria. The most common symptoms are: Abdominal cramps Diarrhea, which may be bloody Nausea Constant fatigue You may not have a fever. If you do, it may be slight. Healthy people infected with E. coli usually feel better within a week."
310,Is there medication for hirsutism?,"With regular use, you should have less hair on your face or body. Anti-androgen blockers help your body make and use fewer male hormones, so you should grow less hair over time. Vaniqa (eflornithine) is a face cream that slows hair growth where you apply it."
310,How do hormones cause hirsutism?,"High levels of male hormones and hirsutism are common in women who have: Polycystic ovary syndrome , which causes small cysts, or fluid-filled sacs, to form on your ovaries. Cushing's syndrome, which you get when you have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol for long periods of time. Tumors in your adrenal glands (which make hormones like cortisol) or your ovaries."
310,Can medications cause hirsutism?,"This can happen with: Drugs that have hormones, like anabolic steroids Drugs that spur hair growth, like Rogaine (minoxidil) A drug called Danocrine (danazol) that can help with endometriosis, when the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of the womb If you have more facial or body hair than you want, there are a number of ways you can remove it."
310,What can you do about the hair from hirsutism?,"Tweezing or threading. Doctors can prescribe drugs that change the way your body grows hair. When you stop using the medication, hair will grow back, though."
310,What is hirsutism?,"If you're a woman and you have a lot of hair growing in places where it normally does just for men, like your upper lip, chin, chest, stomach, or back, that's a condition called hirsutism. The hair is often dark and coarse, instead of the light, fine âpeach fuzzâ that covers most of the body. It's often caused by genes, hormones, or medication. If your mother or sisters have it, you're more likely to get it."
310,Does hirsutism run in families?,"If you're a woman and you have a lot of hair growing in places where it normally does just for men, like your upper lip, chin, chest, stomach, or back, that's a condition called hirsutism. It's also more common in people from the Middle East, South Asia, and the Mediterranean."
311,What are the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal?,"Symptoms can include: Depression Anxiety Fatigue Trouble concentrating Increased hunger Cravings for the drug Nightmares Chills, nerve pain, muscle aches A cocaine overdose is more difficult to treat."
311,What can a cocaine overdose lead to?,"Physical signs include: Increased sweating, body temperature, or heart rate Trouble breathing Chest pain Nausea or vomiting Confusion, seizures, tremors Watch for these mental signs of overdose, too: Anxiety Panic Paranoia Hallucinations Delirium An overdose often leads to a stroke or heart attack. An ER doctor will test for those conditions and try to treat them first. He may also use medication to treat other complications you have."
311,What are the signs of a cocaine overdose?,"Physical signs include: Increased sweating, body temperature, or heart rate Trouble breathing Chest pain Nausea or vomiting Confusion, seizures, tremors Watch for these mental signs of overdose, too: Anxiety Panic Paranoia Hallucinations Delirium An overdose often leads to a stroke or heart attack."
311,What can lead to an overdose and how can cocaine affect you?,"Other short-term effects of cocaine may include: Extreme sensitivity to touch, sound, and sight Intense happiness Anger/irritability Paranoid feeling Decreased appetite People who use cocaine often may also have more serious side effects and health problems, like: Headaches Convulsions and seizures Heart disease, heart attack, and stroke Mood problems Sexual trouble Lung damage HIV or hepatitis if you inject it Bowel decay if you swallow it Loss of smell, nosebleeds, runny nose, and trouble swallowing, if you snort it You may have strong cravings for the drug and the high it brings. But the more you use cocaine, the more your brain will adapt to it. You'll need a stronger dose to feel the same high. This can lead to a dangerous addiction or overdose. Stronger, more frequent doses can also cause long-term changes in your brain's chemistry. Your body and mind begin to rely on the drug. This can make it harder for you to think, sleep, and recall things from memory. Your reaction time may be slower. And you're at risk for more heart, stomach, and lung problems."
311,What are the short-term effects of cocaine?,"Other short-term effects of cocaine may include: Extreme sensitivity to touch, sound, and sight Intense happiness Anger/irritability Paranoid feeling Decreased appetite People who use cocaine often may also have more serious side effects and health problems, like: Headaches Convulsions and seizures Heart disease, heart attack, and stroke Mood problems Sexual trouble Lung damage HIV or hepatitis if you inject it Bowel decay if you swallow it Loss of smell, nosebleeds, runny nose, and trouble swallowing, if you snort it You may have strong cravings for the drug and the high it brings."
312,Are boys or girls more likely to have fragile X syndrome?,"Boys are more likely to have fragile X than girls, and they have more severe symptoms. This is because girls have two copies of the X chromosome. Even if one X chromosome has the gene change, the other copy can be fine. Boys have one X and one Y chromosome. If the X chromosome has the gene change, they will have symptoms of fragile X syndrome."
312,Is fragile X syndrome different in girls than in boys?,"There are several, including: Trouble learning skills like sitting, crawling, or walking Problems with language and speech Hand-flapping and not making eye contact Temper tantrums Poor impulse control Anxiety Extreme sensitivity to light or sound Hyperactivity and trouble paying attention Aggressive and self-destructive behavior in boys Some children with fragile X also have changes to their face and body that can include: A large head A long, narrow face Large ears A large forehead and chin Loose joints Flat feet Enlarged testicles (after puberty) Symptoms are usually milder in girls. While most boys with fragile X have trouble with learning and development, girls usually don't have these issues. Girls with fragile X sometimes have trouble getting pregnant when they grow up. They might also go into menopause earlier than usual."
312,How can you help your child with fragile X syndrome?,"Options include: Special education to help with learning ( IEP and 504 are education plans that guide the school in providing support) Speech and language therapy Occupational therapy to help with daily tasks Behavior therapy Medicines to prevent seizures, manage ADD symptoms like hyperactivity, and treat other behavioral problems The earlier you start treatment, the better. Work with your child's doctor, teachers, and therapists to make a treatment program. Your child might also qualify for free special education services. To learn more about fragile X, join a support group. Or, reach out to an organization like the National Fragile X Foundation for advice and resources."
312,What causes fragile X syndrome?,"This condition can also cause health problems like: Seizures Hearing problems Vision problems Heart problems The FMR1 gene, which is on the X chromosome, makes a protein called FMR that helps nerve cells talk to one another. A child needs this protein for his brain to develop normally. Children with fragile X make too little or none of it. People with this condition also have more copies than usual of a DNA segment known as CGG. In most people, this segment repeats five to 40 times. In people with fragile X, it repeats more than 200 times. The more times this DNA segment repeats, the more serious the symptoms are. This is because girls have two copies of the X chromosome."
312,How severe is fragile X syndrome?,"Medicines and other treatments can improve their behavior and physical symptoms. Boys are more likely to have fragile X than girls, and they have more severe symptoms. As the child gets older, learning and behavior problems can start. Options include: Special education to help with learning ( IEP and 504 are education plans that guide the school in providing support) Speech and language therapy Occupational therapy to help with daily tasks Behavior therapy Medicines to prevent seizures, manage ADD symptoms like hyperactivity, and treat other behavioral problems The earlier you start treatment, the better."
313,What role does the brain play in motion sickness?,"Your brain takes in all this data, and it usually comes together and makes sense. But sometimes your brain gets confusing signals. On a flying plane, for example, you feel like you're moving, but your eyes tell your brain that you don't appear to be going anywhere. The opposite is true as well. After a long sea voyage, you can stand still on dry land but still feel like you're moving. The result is the same: motion sickness."
313,What causes motion sickness?,"You get motion sickness when there are conflicts among your senses. Say you're on a ride at the fair, and it's spinning you around and upside down. Your eyes see one thing, your muscles feel another, and your inner ears sense something else. Your brain can't take in all those mixed signals. That's why you end up feeling dizzy and sick."
313,What medications are available for motion sickness?,"If you're still bothered by motion sickness, you can talk to your doctor about these: Dimenhydrinate ( Dramamine). This over-the-counter antihistamine, used to ease allergies, helps with balance, too. The first dose should be taken about an hour before traveling. More doses are taken every 4 to 6 hours. Scopolamine ( Maldemar). This is a prescription medication. Your wear a patch behind the ear. You apply it 4 hours before needed. A dose lasts 3 days. Other drugs include: Cyclizine ( Marezine, Marzine, Emoquil) Meclizine ( Antivert, Bonine) Promethazine ( Phenadoz, Phenergan, Promethegan) All have side effects, including drowsiness and dry mouth."
313,What role do the ears play in motion sickness?,"Your inner ears, in particular, help control your sense of balance. They are part of a network called the vestibular system. This system includes three pairs of semicircular canals and two sacs, called the saccule and the utricle. They send information about what's going on around you to the brain. The semicircular canals hold a fluid that moves with the turns of your head. The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. They tell the brain whether you're standing up or lying down."
313,What if my motion sickness doesn't go away on its own?,"But there are some simple things you can do if the motion sickness isn't going away on its own: Relax. Find something to focus on, whether it's taking deep breaths or counting backwards from 100. Closing your eyes can help, too. Look at a stable object. If you're on a boat, look at the horizon. If you're in a car, look through the windshield. Avoid alcohol. Eat lightly before travel but don't fast. Breathe fresh air -- and don't smoke. Avoid reading. If you can, get a seat over the wing if you're flying, an upper-deck cabin if you're sailing, or a front-seat spot if you're in a car."
313,Can I go to the doctor for motion sickness?,"Motion sickness usually goes away once the journey is over. But if you're still dizzy, have a headache, continue to vomit, notice hearing loss or chest pain, call your doctor."
313,Is motion sickness a new concept?,"The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. The result is the same: motion sickness. If you can, get a seat over the wing if you're flying, an upper-deck cabin if you're sailing, or a front-seat spot if you're in a car."
313,What are some natural remedies for motion sickness?,"If you're on a boat, look at the horizon. There's some scientific proof that this root, long used as a folk remedy to fight nausea, is effective. But it may act as a blood thinner. Talk to your doctor first before you use it. Mint. Some people say that stimulating a certain point just below the wrist helps ease their nausea."
314,What areas of your body can get dandruff?,"The condition causes little white or yellow flakes of dry skin, which rub off easily, to form on your body. The official name is âseborrheic dermatitis.â If it's on a baby's scalp, you might hear it called âcradle cap.â It usually affects your scalp, but it can happen on other parts of your body. You can have it on your forehead, the sides of your nose, your ears, or your chest."
314,How can you manage severe dandruff?,"Sometimes even the best anti-dandruff shampoo won't get rid of a stubborn case. Some things your dermatologist might try: She might prescribe a steroid cream that you rub onto the affected area once or twice daily. You may also need an antifungal medicine that you take by mouth or apply to your scalp or skin to get rid of the yeast. You may need to apply an oil-based medicine and leave it on your scalp overnight under a shower cap, if the problem is on your head."
315,Why do teens get acne?,"Acne isn't a serious health risk, though severe acne can cause permanent scars. Acne can also damage self-esteem."
315,What are blackheads?,"Blackheads: Black bumps that are impacted pores in which material pushes out through the follicles. The black color is not from dirt. It may be from bacteria, dead skin cells, and matter that react with oxygen."
315,Can medications cause acne?,They are usually taken daily for four to six months and then tapered and discontinued as acne improves.
315,What are whiteheads?,Acne can appear as one of the following: Whiteheads: White dots that are pores impacted with oil and skin covered by skin layers.
315,Why do some people get acne and others don't?,"The exact cause of acne is not known, but hormones called androgens can play a role. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens make the skin's oil glands get larger and make more sebum. Androgens also can increase because of hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills. Genetics may also matter. If your parents had acne, you may have inherited that tendency. Acne is not caused by dirt."
315,What are some tips to prevent acne?,The black color is not from dirt. It is believed to reduce the size of the oil glands so that much less oil is produced and to help prevent clogged pores. Use oil-free or noncomedogenic products (those that won't clog pores) on your face. Don't squeeze or pick blemishes. Popping pimples can drive acne bacteria deeper into the skin. Picking can lead to more inflammation and permanent scarring.
316,Should you call your doctor if you snore and also are sleepy during the day?,"You are frequently overly sleepy and tired during the day. You could have obstructive sleep apnea, a serious condition preventing you from getting enough oxygen during sleep."

317,How can acetaminophen help my knee pain?,"Acetaminophen treats mild to moderate pain. It's in over 6,000 products, by itself and with other medicines. If you take too much, it can harm your liver. So check the label on everything you take so you don't accidentally overdose."
317,How long will it take for corticosteroids to help knee pain?,"It can take about 2 to 3 days before you feel the effect. Most people can return to work or go home right after they get the shot. Some people get what's called the ""steroid flare,"" a burst of pain in the injection area for up to 48 hours."
317,How can corticosteroids help treat knee pain?,"Corticosteroids aren't the type of steroid that builds muscle. In the best cases, they can lower inflammation and relieve pain for months. You probably won't get more than two or three steroid shots per year."
317,"How can capsaicin creams, gels, or patches help my knee pain?","When your pain is severe or you can't move your knee, you should call your doctor. So check the label on everything you take so you don't accidentally overdose."
317,What are common side effects of NSAIDs?,"When your pain is severe or you can't move your knee, you should call your doctor. The downside is that neither of these types of shots will help everyone."
317,How can hyaluronic acid help treat knee pain?,"Your doctor can give you a shot into your knee, after numbing it, to deliver medicine directly to your joint. Some people who got injections of it into their knee were able to move easier and hurt less for as long as 6 months. The downside is that neither of these types of shots will help everyone. They can also cause discolored skin where you got the shot, infection, and weakened tendons, which connect muscles to bones."
318,What are the side effects of yohimbe?,"Side effects can include: Higher blood pressure and a faster or irregular heartbeat Chest pain Breathing problems Flushed skin or a rash Tremors (rhythmic muscle movements you didn't mean to make) Pain in your genitals A painful erection that won't go away You could: Feel dizzy, nervous, worried, or cranky Get a headache Get an upset stomach or lose your appetite Have trouble sleeping The safest bet is to talk to your doctor before you start taking it."
319,What is Friedreich's ataxia?,Friedreich ataxia: Problems related to a protein called frataxin cause nerve damage and often heart problems.
319,What are metal metabolism disorders?,"Metal metabolism disorders: Levels of trace metals in the blood are controlled by special proteins. Inherited metabolic disorders can result in protein malfunction and toxic accumulation of metal in the body: Wilson disease (toxic copper levels accumulate in the liver, brain, and other organs) Hemochromatosis (the intestines absorb excessive iron, which builds up in the liver, pancreas, joints, and heart, causing damage) Organic acidemias: methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia."
319,What is the cause of most inherited metabolic disorders?,"The original cause of most genetic metabolic disorders is a gene mutation that occurred many, many generations ago. The gene mutation is passed along through the generations, ensuring its preservation."
319,What are the symptoms of an inherited metabolic disorder?,"Urea cycle disorders: ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and citrullinemia The symptoms of genetic metabolic disorders vary widely depending on the metabolism problem present. Some symptoms of inherited metabolic disorders include: Lethargy Poor appetite Abdominal pain Vomiting Weight loss Jaundice Failure to gain weight or grow Developmental delay Seizures Coma Abnormal odor of urine, breath, sweat, or saliva The symptoms may come on suddenly or progress slowly."
319,How many people have inherited metabolic disorders?,"Considered all together, inherited metabolic disorders may affect about 1 in 1,000 to 2,500 newborns."
319,What are lysosomes?,"Some of the more common and important genetic metabolic disorders include: Lysosomal storage disorders : Lysosomes are spaces inside cells that break down waste products of metabolism. Various enzyme deficiencies inside lysosomes can result in buildup of toxic substances, causing metabolic disorders including: Hurler syndrome (abnormal bone structure and developmental delay) Niemann- Pick disease (babies develop liver enlargement, difficulty feeding, and nerve damage) Tay- Sachs disease (progressive weakness in a months-old child, progressing to severe nerve damage; the child usually lives only until age 4 or 5) Gaucher disease (bone pain, enlarged liver, and low platelet counts, often mild, in children or adults) Fabry disease (pain in the extremities in childhood, with kidney and heart disease and strokes in adulthood; only males are affected) Krabbe disease (progressive nerve damage, developmental delay in young children; occasionally adults are affected) Galactosemia: Impaired breakdown of the sugar galactose leads to jaundice, vomiting, and liver enlargement after breast or formula feeding by a newborn."
319,What is maple syrup urine disease?,"Maple syrup urine disease: Deficiency of an enzyme called BCKD causes buildup of amino acids in the body. Nerve damage results, and the urine smells like syrup."
319,What happens if the sugar galactose isn't broken down right in a newborn?,"Various enzyme deficiencies inside lysosomes can result in buildup of toxic substances, causing metabolic disorders including: Hurler syndrome (abnormal bone structure and developmental delay) Niemann- Pick disease (babies develop liver enlargement, difficulty feeding, and nerve damage) Tay- Sachs disease (progressive weakness in a months-old child, progressing to severe nerve damage; the child usually lives only until age 4 or 5) Gaucher disease (bone pain, enlarged liver, and low platelet counts, often mild, in children or adults) Fabry disease (pain in the extremities in childhood, with kidney and heart disease and strokes in adulthood; only males are affected) Krabbe disease (progressive nerve damage, developmental delay in young children; occasionally adults are affected) Galactosemia: Impaired breakdown of the sugar galactose leads to jaundice, vomiting, and liver enlargement after breast or formula feeding by a newborn."
319,What is the meaning of metabolism?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Metabolism refers to all the chemical reactions taking place in the body to convert or use energy. A few major examples of metabolism include: Breaking down the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food to release energy. Transforming excess nitrogen into waste products excreted in urine. Breaking down or converting chemicals into other substances and transporting them inside cells."
319,What are treatments for inherited metabolic disorders?,"Treatment may include such measures as: Special diets that eliminate certain nutrients Taking enzyme replacements, or other supplements that support metabolism Treating the blood with chemicals to detoxify dangerous metabolic by-products Whenever possible, a person with an inherited metabolic disorder should receive care at a medical center with experience with these rare conditions."
319,What are inherited metabolic disorders?,"Metabolism is an organized but chaotic chemical assembly line. Raw materials, half-finished products, and waste materials are constantly being used, produced, transported, and excreted. The ""workers"" on the assembly line are enzymes and other proteins that make chemical reactions happen. In most inherited metabolic disorders, a single enzyme is either not produced by the body at all or is produced in a form that doesn't work. The missing enzyme is like an absentee worker on the assembly line. Depending on that enzyme's job, its absence means toxic chemicals may build up, or an essential product may not be produced."
319,What are peroxisomal disorders?,"Peroxisomal disorders: Similar to lysosomes, peroxisomes are tiny spaces filled with enzymes inside cells. Poor enzyme function inside peroxisomes can lead to buildup of toxic products of metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders include: Zellweger syndrome (abnormal facial features, enlarged liver, and nerve damage in infants) Adrenoleukodystrophy (symptoms of nerve damage can develop in childhood or early adulthood depending on the form.)"
320,How do you care for bonded teeth?,"Bonded teeth do not require special care. Simply follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush teeth at least twice a day, floss at least once a day, rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash once or twice a day, and see your dentist for regular professional check-ups and cleanings. Because bonding material can chip, it is important to avoid such habits as biting fingernails; chewing on pens, ice, or other hard food objects; or using your bonded teeth as an opener."
320,How long does bonding material last?,"The lifespan of bonding materials for the teeth depends on how much bonding was done and your oral habits. Typically, however, bonding material lasts from three years up to about 10 years before needing to be touched up or replaced."
320,When do you get dental bonding?,Dental bonding is an option that can be considered: To repair decayed teeth (composite resins are used to fill cavities) To repair chipped or cracked teeth To improve the appearance of discolored teeth To close spaces between teeth To make teeth look longer To change the shape of teeth As a cosmetic alternative to amalgam fillings To protect a portion of the tooth's root that has been exposed when gums recede Preparation.
320,What's the procedure for having a tooth bonded?,"Anesthesia is often not necessary unless the bonding is being used to fill a decayed tooth, the tooth needs to be drilled to change its shape, or the chip is near the nerve. Your dentist will use a shade guide to select a composite resin color that will closely match the color of your tooth. Next, the surface of the tooth will be roughened and a conditioning liquid applied. These procedures help the bonding material adhere to the tooth. The tooth-colored, putty-like resin is then applied, molded, and smoothed to the desired shape. A bright, usually blue, light, or laser is then used to harden the material. After the material is hardened, your dentist will further trim and shape it, and polish it to match the sheen of the rest of the tooth surface. Generally, bonding can range in cost from $100 to $400 per tooth."
321,What findings point to further tests in a physical exam and history for Crohn's disease?,"You'll probably go through a combination of exams, lab tests, and imaging studies with these goals in mind: Rule out other health problems Make a clear diagnosis of Crohn's disease Find out exactly which part of the digestive tract is affected Your doctor will begin by gathering information about your health and your family health history. She'll do a physical exam and look for symptoms of Crohn's that usually include: Belly pain and cramps Blood in your poop Diarrhea Drainage from a painful sore near your anus Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Mouth sores Urgent bowel movements Weight loss Your doctor may request lab tests in order to look for problems that might be linked to Crohn's disease."

These tests check for signs of infection, inflammation, internal bleeding, and low levels of substances such as iron, protein, or minerals."
321,How is barium given in the diagnosis for Crohn's disease?,"When barium fluid is given by mouth, it is called an upper GI series. When barium fluid is placed in the rectum, it is called a barium enema. The barium fluid flows through your intestines and looks white on X-ray film. This makes it easier to view problem areas. With a barium X-ray, your doctor may be able to see ulcers, narrowed areas of the intestine, abnormal connections between organs, known as fistulae, or other problems."
321,How do you know if you have Crohn's disease?,"There isn't any single test that can diagnose Crohn's disease. This condition has many symptoms that are the same as those for other health problems. To make a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, your doctor is likely to gather information from multiple sources."
321,What imaging studies are used to diagnose Crohn's disease?,"If barium X-rays show some sign of disease, your doctor may request other X-rays or imaging studies."
321,How can imaging studies help with diagnosing Crohn's disease?,"Crohn's disease may appear anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. X-rays and other images can help identify the severity and location of Crohn's disease."
321,How does a video capsule endoscopy help with diagnosing Crohn's disease?,"Video capsule endoscopy: For video capsule endoscopy, you swallow a small capsule or pill that holds a miniature video camera. As it travels through your small intestine, it sends images of the lining to a receiver you wear on a belt around your waist. The doctor downloads the images and reviews them on a computer. They can provide detailed information about early, mild problems associated with Crohn's disease. This technique may be especially helpful if you have symptoms of Crohn's disease that can't be seen by other small bowel tests."
321,When do you need other tests after your barium X-ray for Crohn's disease?,"If barium X-rays show some sign of disease, your doctor may request other X-rays or imaging studies. These X-rays can help identify exactly how much of your digestive tract is affected by Crohn's disease."
321,What happens after the tests and exams for Crohn's disease?,"You'll probably go through a combination of exams, lab tests, and imaging studies with these goals in mind: Rule out other health problems Make a clear diagnosis of Crohn's disease Find out exactly which part of the digestive tract is affected Your doctor will begin by gathering information about your health and your family health history. You should avoid it if: You have an obstruction in the small intestine."
321,What happens during a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy for Crohn's disease?,"He'll inflate them and deflate the balloons to move the tube through your intestine. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy: Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy allow your doctor to directly view the large intestine, which is the lower part of the digestive tract. A colonoscopy can provide a view of all of the large intestine and often the end of the small intestine, which is frequently affected by Crohn's. In either case, the doctor can directly view the colon to check for signs of ulcers, inflammation, or bleeding. The doctor can also take small samples of tissue to examine under a microscope, known as a biopsy. This helps determine whether the tissue shows signs of Crohn's disease or other problems.\ Computed tomography ( CT) scan: CT scanning uses computer-aided X-ray techniques to make more detailed images of the abdomen and pelvis than can be seen in traditional X-rays."
321,What are the goals of tests and exams to diagnose Crohn's disease?,"To make a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, your doctor is likely to gather information from multiple sources. You'll probably go through a combination of exams, lab tests, and imaging studies with these goals in mind: Rule out other health problems Make a clear diagnosis of Crohn's disease Find out exactly which part of the digestive tract is affected Your doctor will begin by gathering information about your health and your family health history. These X-rays can help identify exactly how much of your digestive tract is affected by Crohn's disease."
322,How is fibromyalgia treated?,"Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe pain relievers, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and drugs that help you sleep. The three drugs approved specifically for fibro pain are: Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Milnacipran ( Savella) Pregabalin ( Lyrica) Over-the-counter painkillers may help, too. Stronger medicines, like opioids, tend not to work well in the long run, and you could become dependent on them."
322,What is fibromyalgia?,"Fibromyalgia is the second most common condition affecting your bones and muscles. But a combination of medication, exercise, managing your stress, and healthy habits may ease your symptoms enough that you can live a normal, active life. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe pain relievers, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and drugs that help you sleep."
322,What causes fibromyalgia?,"We do know certain things suggest you're more likely to get it: You're a woman. You have another painful disease, such as arthritis, or an infection. You have a mood disorder, like anxiety or depression. You were physically or emotionally abused or have PTSD. You rarely exercise. Other family members have it. If your doctor can't find another reason for how you feel, they'll use a two-part scoring system to measure how widespread your pain has been and how much your symptoms affect your daily life."

Use a calendar for ongoing weekly tasks or projects that will take a while."
324,Does it help to get frustrated with a child with ADHD?,"If you get frustrated when your child doesn't follow through, remember that it's not her fault. It's just how her brain works. Having ADHD is hard for her, too. She probably gets called out by teachers, peers, and maybe even you many times a day. Don't dwell on her mistakes. Focus on her strengths and play up her successes."
324,What kind of rewards won't motivate a child with ADHD?,You can't just tell a child with ADHD to go clean her room. That kind of goal is too abstract and too far off to inspire a kid with ADHD.
324,How can I help my child complete chores on their own?,"That chore is too big for a kid who's easily distracted. Write them down, so your kid can check off the tasks as she finishes each one. Add a picture of the clean room to the checklist so she can see the goal."

329,How is viral pneumonia diagnosed?,"Your doctor might be able to tell if you have viral pneumonia just by examining you and asking questions about your symptoms and general health. Chances are your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. That's because certain sounds can mean fluid is in your lungs. But if your doctor isn't sure, you might have to get a chest X-ray."
329,What tests are used to diagnose viral pneumonia?,"Your doctor might be able to tell if you have viral pneumonia just by examining you and asking questions about your symptoms and general health. These might include: A pulse oximetry (a small gizmo clipped to your finger checks for enough oxygen in your blood) Blood tests Tests of the gunk you cough up (sputum tests) CT scan to look more closely at your lungs A pleural fluid culture (where your doctor takes some fluid from your chest through a needle) Bronchoscopy -- a look into your lungs through a scope Your doctor won't prescribe antibiotics, because they don't kill viruses."

If you have had HIV for many years, you may get other infections related to advance HIV pr AIDS (see below). Both women and men may get thrush, a kind of yeast infection in your mouth or on your tongue. Women could get severe vaginal yeast infections."
331,Who should get tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"It's the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Clinics that do HIV tests keep your results secret. Some may even do tests anonymously, without ever taking your name. You can also buy test kits at the drugstore and take the test at home. If you're at high risk, because you use needles for drugs or have multiple sex partners, for example, you should get tested at least once a year. If you've been stuck by a needle or been in contact with a lot of blood from a person you aren't sure is negative for HIV, you should get tested, too."
331,How can you protect yourself from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?+F157,"It's the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. You can get HIV when an infected person's body fluids -- including blood, semen, fluids from the vagina, or breast milk -- get into your blood. They could get HIV after being poked with needles that have HIV-infected blood or after infected blood gets on an open cut or splashes into their eyes or inside their nose. The only way to know if you have HIV is to take an HIV test. If you're at high risk, because you use needles for drugs or have multiple sex partners, for example, you should get tested at least once a year. If you don't, the virus can change into a strain that is harder to treat."
331,How can you get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"It's the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. You can get HIV when an infected person's body fluids -- including blood, semen, fluids from the vagina, or breast milk -- get into your blood. People commonly get HIV from: Having unprotected sex with an infected person Sharing a needle to take drugs Dirty needles used for a tattoo or in body piercing Mothers with HIV also can give the virus to their babies, before or when they're born or through breastfeeding."
331,What should you do if you have side effects while taking antiretroviral (ARV) in your treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"This is called ART, for antiretroviral therapy, and each medicine is an ARV, or antiretroviral. Although the great majority of persons tolerate ARVs very well, these medicines can cause side effects, including: Nausea, upset stomach Skin rash or yellowing skin Fatigue Strange dreams or insomnia Losing or gaining body fat Lidney or liver problems Brittle bones If you develop these or other symptoms while taking ARVs, you should contact your doctor before stopping the drugs. There may be ways to treat the symptoms rather than having to stop the life-saving ARV drugs."
331,How will you know if you have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"It's the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The best way to protect yourself from HIV is to avoid activities that put you at risk. Most look for antibodies that fight the virus or traces of the virus itself in your blood, but you can also check urine or fluid from your mouth (not saliva). A positive test means that there were traces of HIV; a negative test means that no signs of HIV were found. Some kinds of tests can give a result in 20-30 minutes. Most tests can't detect HIV right after infection, because it takes usually takes 2-8 weeks for your body to make antibodies or for enough virus to grow inside you. It may take up to 6 months before you'll see a positive result, which means an early test could be negative even though you're infected."
331,How can treatments help you deal with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"The only way to know if you have HIV is to take an HIV test. Today, a variety of treatments can significantly slow down, and sometimes stop altogether, the progress of HIV infection. After you're diagnosed, your doctor will start you on a treatment plan with different types of anti- HIV drugs. This is called ART, for antiretroviral therapy, and each medicine is an ARV, or antiretroviral."

332,What is an MRI for prostate cancer?,"Instead, MRI uses a large magnet, radio waves, and a computer to produce these images. In prostate cancer patients, MRI may be used to examine the prostate and nearby lymph nodes to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Certain MRI exams require an injection of a dye (contrast material)."
333,What are the most common ways that HIV spreads?,"You can get HIV from direct contact with: Blood Semen Vaginal fluid Breast milk Most commonly, the virus is passed from person to person by: Sex Sharing needles Mother-to-baby infection during pregnancy People with a new HIV infection often say they feel like they have the flu."

You may hear them called âantiretroviral drugs.â Your doctor will prescribe a combination of these medications as antiretroviral therapy, or ART. The medicines you take will help keep the virus from making copies of itself. That will keep you healthy and also lower your risk of spreading HIV to others. The goal of ART is to lower your viral load. It won't cure your HIV, but with the right medicine, the amount of the virus in your blood may drop below a detectable level and stay that way for a long time."
333,What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?,"Not everyone who has HIV will get AIDS, but without treatment with antriretroviral drugs the infection will progress to AIDS. That usually happens in 10-15 years, according to the World Health Organization. When you have HIV, your doctor will watch the amount of the virus in your system. The amount of time it takes for HIV to become AIDS is different for everyone."
333,What are warnings signs that you may have AIDS?,"HIV is a virus. Warning signs that you may have AIDS include: Sudden weight loss Night sweats Fever that keeps coming back Feeling very tired for no reason Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week Sores in your mouth, in your anal area, or on your genitals Pneumonia Blotches on your skin or inside your mouth, nose, or eyelids Memory loss Depression More than 25 drugs are approved to treat HIV."
334,Why are my glands swollen?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Swollen glands are a sign that your body is fighting off an infection or an illness. Most of the time, they return to normal size when their job is done. These glands are your lymph nodes. You have them throughout your body. But there are clusters of them in places like your neck, under your arm and in the crease between your thigh and your torso (where your leg begins). You can sometimes feel these clusters as little bumps, especially if they're swollen. They're part of your lymphatic system. Along with your spleen, tonsils, and adenoids, they help protect you from harmful germs."
335,What are the main side effects of 5-aminosalicylic acid drugs for Crohn's disease?,"There are two main 5- ASA drugs used in Crohn's: Mesalamine ( Apriso, Asacol, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa) Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) The main side effects are: Diarrhea Nausea Stomachache Headache Skin rash Sulfasalazine can cut sperm counts in men, and it may lower your supply of infection-fighting white blood cells. If you're allergic to sulfa drugs, you may have a reaction to sulfasalazine and shouldn't take it."
335,What are the main goals if you have Crohn's disease?,"When you have Crohn's disease, you want to prevent flare-ups and keep them away for good."
335,What are the side effects of taking steroid drugs for Crohn's disease?,"When you take steroids, you might notice one or more of these side effects: Acne Hair growth on your face Night sweats Swelling of the face (called ""moon face"") Trouble sleeping Weight gain More serious side effects include: Cataracts Diabetes Glaucoma High blood pressure Weakened bones and fractures Because steroids weaken your immune system, they can make you more likely to get an infection. Children who take them for a long time may grow more slowly than normal."
335,What are some side effects of steroids?,"When you take steroids, you might notice one or more of these side effects: Acne Hair growth on your face Night sweats Swelling of the face (called ""moon face"") Trouble sleeping Weight gain More serious side effects include: Cataracts Diabetes Glaucoma High blood pressure Weakened bones and fractures Because steroids weaken your immune system, they can make you more likely to get an infection."
335,What are the side effects of 5-ASA drugs?,"There are two main 5- ASA drugs used in Crohn's: Mesalamine ( Apriso, Asacol, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa) Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) The main side effects are: Diarrhea Nausea Stomachache Headache Skin rash Sulfasalazine can cut sperm counts in men, and it may lower your supply of infection-fighting white blood cells. If you're allergic to sulfa drugs, you may have a reaction to sulfasalazine and shouldn't take it."
335,Do 5-ASA drugs work for Crohn's disease?,"There's some question about how effective these drugs are for Crohn's. Your doctor may suggest these if you have mild Crohn's disease in your large intestine (also called the colon). Once your symptoms get better, you may continue to take them to prevent flare-ups."
335,Can steroids help Crohn's disease?,"These are one of the oldest treatments for Crohn's disease. Your doctor may suggest one: If your case is mild to moderate If other drugs aren't helping If your symptoms are severe right away Your doctor may call them corticosteroids, but most people just call them steroids. Once your symptoms get better, you may continue to take them to prevent flare-ups."
335,What are types of steroids to take for Crohn's disease?,"Steroid drugs you take by mouth include: Budesonide ( Entocort EC) Prednisone ( Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) Budesonide lowers inflammation only in the intestine when you take it as a capsule. Because it's designed to dissolve in the small intestine, it may cause fewer side effects than other steroids. If your Crohn's disease is severe, or it's in many parts of your intestines, you may need a higher dose through an IV. There's some question about how effective these drugs are for Crohn's."
335,Are there drugs to help ease Crohn's disease flare ups?,"Inflammation in your intestines causes symptoms like belly pain and diarrhea. Anti-inflammatory drugs ease them and may even keep them away for years. Although they aren't a cure, they can help you feel much better. Your doctor will help you decide which one is best for you. Once your symptoms get better, you may continue to take them to prevent flare-ups."
336,Is vasculitis serious?,"Vasculitis can be very serious. In an extreme situation, when a segment of a blood vessel becomes weakened, it may then stretch and bulge (called an aneurysm). The wall of the blood vessel can become so weak that it ruptures and bleeds, possibly causing death. Fortunately, this is a very rare event. If a blood vessel becomes inflamed and narrowed, the blood supply to the area of the body it serves may be partially or completely blocked. If alternate blood vessels (called collateral blood vessels) are not available in sufficient quantity to carry the blood to such sites, the tissue supplied by the affected vessels will die. Because vasculitis can occur in any part of the body, any tissue or organ can be affected."
336,What is the treatment for vasculitis?,"Treatment of vasculitis depends entirely upon diagnosis and the affected organs. When vasculitis is the result of an allergic reaction, it may go away on its own and not require treatment. In other instances, when critical organs such as the lungs, brain, or kidneys are involved, aggressive and timely treatment is necessary."
336,How serious is vasculitis?,"Vasculitis can be very serious. In an extreme situation, when a segment of a blood vessel becomes weakened, it may then stretch and bulge (called an aneurysm).

Because vasculitis can occur in any part of the body, any tissue or organ can be affected."
336,What are the different types of vasculitis?,"Some of the many forms of vasculitis may be restricted to particular organs. Examples include vasculitis that affects only the skin, eye, brain, or certain internal organs. There are also types of vasculitis that may affect many organ systems at the same time. Some of these generalized forms may be quite mild and may not require treatment. Others may be severe, affecting critical organs."

Some of these generalized forms may be quite mild and may not require treatment. Others may be severe, affecting critical organs."
336,What causes vasculitis?,"In many cases, the cause of vasculitis is unknown. In a few cases, however, the origins may be traced to recent or ongoing infections, such as those caused by certain viruses. Occasionally, an allergic reaction to a medication may trigger vasculitis."
336,Are corticosteroids used to treat vasculitis?,"Treatment generally consists of corticosteroid medications, or simply ""steroids."" Chemotherapy drugs (such as those used to treat cancer) are also used, but in doses usually lower than people with cancer may receive. The goal of this type of therapy is to suppress the abnormal immune response that has led to blood vessel damage. Other medications may include methotrexate or cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxin) and a biologic drug called tocilizumab ( Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lower the dose of steroids that a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids."

Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lower the dose of steroids that a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids."
336,Do infections cause vasculitis?,"Vasculitis also may be related to other diseases of the immune system that the person has had for months or years. For example, it could be a complication of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. If alternate blood vessels (called collateral blood vessels) are not available in sufficient quantity to carry the blood to such sites, the tissue supplied by the affected vessels will die."
336,What are the symptoms of vasculitis?,"In many cases, the cause of vasculitis is unknown. Because vasculitis can occur in any part of the body, any tissue or organ can be affected. Vasculitis in the brain may cause a stroke, or in the heart, may result in a heart attack. Sometimes the symptoms may be as general as fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and loss of energy. If you suffer any unusual symptoms, see your doctor. Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lower the dose of steroids that a person needs."
337,How does organ disease cause cats to drool and how can I fix this?,"Organ disease: As pets age, they're more likely to get sick. Liver and kidney diseases can cause drooling, too. Vets suggest annual checkups to diagnose and treat such diseases early."
337,How does heatstroke cause cats to drool and how can I fix this?,"Heatstroke: Pets with flat faces, such as Persian cats, are more likely to have heatstroke. It isn’t as common in cats as it is in other animals, though. Still, if your cat's had too much sun or not enough water, that's dangerous for her. Always have fresh, clean water available. Make sure your cat has shady places to cool off, too. On very hot days, keep her indoors, limit her exercise, and never leave her in a parked car. Call your vet right way if you suspect heatstroke."
337,How do poisonous plants cause cats to drool and how can I fix this?,"Poisonous plants: Common plants like tulips, azaleas, and chrysanthemums can make your cat drool, as well as make her sick, so don't let your feline friend eat them. For a list of poisonous plants, check with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( ASPCA)."
337,How do upper respiratory infections cause cats to drool and how can I fix this?,"Upper respiratory infections: Drooling can signal an infection of the nose, throat, or sinuses. Cats that live in homes or shelters with other pets have a higher risk. Stress is another factor. Only your vet should treat an infection. But you can take steps to protect your cat from getting one: Keep her up to date on vaccines, indoors, and away from other pets, and wash your hands between handling different animals. Only you know your cat’s normal behavior. If it changes for more than a day, she seems stressed, or she isn't eating and playing as usual, let your vet know."
337,Why do mouth disease and tooth decay cause cats to drool and how can I fix this?,"To check, pull her lip back toward her ear. Are they brown? Are the gums red, swollen, or even bleeding? Try a professional cleaning first, and then brush her teeth daily. Have your vet check for gingivitis, mouth ulcers, and tumors. If this happens when you put her in teh car to take her to the vet, try putting her in her carrier in the back seat without driving anywhere."
337,How does motion sickness cause cats to drool and how can I fix this?,"Stress: Open-mouth panting and breathing are signs of anxiety. If this happens when you put her in teh car to take her to the vet, try putting her in her carrier in the back seat without driving anywhere. Then, slowly work up to backing out of the driveway and driving around the block. Gradually repeat the routine as needed to ease her stress. You can also drape a breathable cloth over the carrier before heading out, so she doesn’t panic."
338,What are the symptoms of conversion disorder?,"Conversion disorder symptoms most commonly look like issues involving your nervous system (brain, spinal cord, or other nerves). These include: Uncontrollable movements Tunnel vision or blindness Loss of smell or speech Numbness or paralysis There's no test to diagnose conversion disorder."
338,What are the treatments for conversion disorder?,"Psychotherapy treatments are most often used, including: Occupational or physical therapy Counseling Hypnosis Antidepressants or antipsychotic drugs Symptoms can last from a few days to several weeks."
338,What are the causes of conversion disorder?,"While the specific cause of conversion disorder is still being studied, researchers think it develops as a way for your brain to deal with emotional strife. It's almost always triggered by stressful situations and other mental disorders. And the symptoms usually develop suddenly."
338,What steps can help prevent conversion disorder?,"They cause you stress in social and work settings. There is no specific medication to treat conversion disorder. If you're already living with a mental health disorder, see your doctor regularly and take your recommended medications to help with prevention, as well."
339,What two parts are in a pacemaker?,"The pacemaker has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The pulse generator houses the battery and a tiny computer, and resides just under the skin of the chest. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. They send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle, as well as sense the heart's electrical activity. Each impulse causes the heart to contract. The pacemaker may have one to three leads, depending on the type of pacemaker needed to treat your heart problem."
339,What will the temporary ID card of your pacemaker tell you?,"Call your doctor if you notice: Increased drainage, bleeding, or oozing from the insertion site Increased opening of the incision Redness around the site Warmth along the site Increased body temperature (fever or chills) Your pacemaker settings will be checked before you leave the hospital. You will receive a temporary ID card that tells you: The type of pacemaker and leads you have. The date of the pacemaker implant. The name of the doctor who implanted the pacemaker. Within three months, you will receive a permanent card from the pacemaker company. Carry this card with you at all times in case you need medical attention at another hospital."
339,What are the different types of pacemakers?,"There are different types of pacemakers: Single-chamber pacemakers use one lead in the upper chamber (atria) or lower chamber (ventricles) of the right side of the heart. Dual-chamber pacemakers use one lead in the right atrium and one lead in the right ventricle of your heart. Biventricular pacemakers use three leads: one placed in the right atrium, one placed in the right ventricle, and one placed in the left ventricle (via the coronary sinus vein)."
339,What should I do after the pacemaker procedure?,"Do not lift objects that weigh more than 10 pounds. Do not hold your arm above shoulder level for three weeks. Avoid activities that require pushing or pulling heavy objects, such as shoveling the snow or mowing the lawn. Stop any activity before you become overtired. Avoid golfing, tennis, and swimming for 6 weeks after the procedure. Try to walk as much as possible for exercise. Ask your doctor when you can resume more strenuous activities. Your doctor will tell you when you can go back to work, usually within a week after you go home. If you have the flexibility at your job, ease back to your regular works schedule."
339,What happens after the pacemaker procedure?,You may be admitted to the hospital overnight. The nurses will monitor your heart rate and rhythm.
339,How long will my pacemaker last?,"Pacemakers may last five to 10 years and sometimes longer, depending on how often they are used. When the battery becomes low, it will need to be changed."
339,What happens during the pacemaker procedure?,"The endocardial pacemaker implant takes about one to five hours to perform. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous line ( IV) into your arm or hand. This is so you may receive medications and fluids during the procedure. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The monitors allow the doctor and nurse to check your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and other measurements during the pacemaker implant. Your left or right side of your chest will be shaved and cleansed with a special soap. Sterile drapes are used to cover you from your neck to your feet. A strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. The doctor will numb your skin by injecting a local numbing medication. You will feel a pinching or burning feeling at first. Then, it will become numb. Once this occurs, an incision will be made to insert the pacemaker and leads. You may feel a pulling as the doctor makes a pocket in the tissue under your skin for the pacemaker. You should not feel pain. If you do, tell your nurse. After the pocket is made, the doctor will insert the leads into a vein and guide them into position using the X-ray machine. After the leads are in place, their function is tested to make sure they can increase your heart rate. This is called ""pacing"" and involves delivering small amounts of energy through the leads into the heart muscle. This causes the heart to contract. When your heart rate increases, you may feel your heart is racing or beating faster. It is very important to tell your doctor or nurse any symptoms you feel. Any pain should be reported immediately. After the leads are tested the doctor will connect them to your pacemaker. Your doctor will determine the rate of your pacemaker and other settings. The final pacemaker settings are done after the implant using a special device called a programmer."
339,How often will I need to see my doctor?,"A complete pacemaker check should be done six weeks after your pacemaker is implanted. This follow-up appointment is critical, because adjustments will be made that will prolong the life of your pacemaker. Then your pacemaker should be checked every three months on the telephone to evaluate battery function. Your nurse will explain how to check your pacemaker using the telephone transmitter. Once or twice a year you will need a more complete exam. If you have a biventricular pacemaker, you may need to visit the doctor's office or hospital more frequently to make sure your device is working properly and the settings do not need to be adjusted."
339,Should I avoid certain electrical devices with a pacemaker?,"Electric blankets, heating pads, and microwave ovens can be used and will not interfere with the function of your pacemaker. Cell phones should not be placed directly against the chest or on the same side as your pacemaker. You will need to avoid strong electric or magnetic fields, such as some industrial equipment; ham radios; high intensity radio waves (found near large electrical generators, power plants, or radiofrequency transmission towers); and arc resistance welders. Do not undergo any tests that require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). When going through airport security, show your pacemaker card without going through the screening machine because the pacemaker will set off the security alarms. Your doctor or nurse can provide more information about what types of equipment may interfere with your pacemaker. If you have concerns about your job or activities, ask your doctor."
339,What is pacemaker?,"The normal, healthy heart has its own pacemaker that regulates the rate that the heart beats. However, some hearts don't beat regularly. A pacemaker can sometimes correct the problem. A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm. A pacemaker may also be used to treat fainting spells (syncope), congestive heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Pacemakers are implanted just under the skin of the chest during a minor surgical procedure."
339,What else are pacemakers used to treat besides heart rate?,"A pacemaker may also be used to treat fainting spells (syncope), congestive heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. This is called ""pacing"" and involves delivering small amounts of energy through the leads into the heart muscle."
339,When should you call your doctor about the pacemaker procedure?,"You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. Keep your wound clean and dry. Look at your wound every day to make sure it is healing. Call your doctor if you notice: Increased drainage, bleeding, or oozing from the insertion site Increased opening of the incision Redness around the site Warmth along the site Increased body temperature (fever or chills) Your pacemaker settings will be checked before you leave the hospital."
339,How is the type of pacemaker and heart rate chosen?,"The pacemaker may have one to three leads, depending on the type of pacemaker needed to treat your heart problem. The doctor programs the minimum heart rate. When your heart rate drops below that set rate, your pacemaker generates (fires) an electrical impulse that passes through the lead to the heart muscle. This causes the heart muscle to contract, creating a heartbeat."
339,How are pacemakers implanted with the epicardial approach?,"Epicardial approach. This technique is more commonly used in children than adults. General anesthesia is given to put you to sleep. The surgeon attaches the lead tip to the heart muscle, while the other end of the lead (attached to the pulse generator) is placed in a pocket created under the skin in the abdomen. Although recovery with the epicardial approach is longer than that of the transvenous approach, minimally invasive techniques have enabled shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times. The doctor will determine, which pacemaker implant method is best for you. Once this occurs, an incision will be made to insert the pacemaker and leads."
339,How are pacemakers implanted with the endocardial approach?,"Pacemakers are implanted two ways: Endocardial approach. An incision is made in the chest where the leads and pacemaker are inserted. The lead(s) is inserted through the incision and into a vein, then guided to the heart with the aid of the x-ray machine. The lead tip attaches to the heart muscle, while the other end of the lead (attached to the pulse generator) is placed in a pocket created under the skin in the upper chest. The doctor will numb your skin by injecting a local numbing medication."
340,What are some tips and precautions when doing exercises to improve your posture?,"Pull your abdominal muscles in and up toward your spine as you exercise. Work with slow, controlled movements, breathing evenly, without holding your breath. Tailor your number of repetitions and sets to your current level of core fitness. If you have mild back pain, core-strengthening exercises may improve posture, ease symptoms, and prevent future pain. If you have severe back pain or injury, are out of shape, or have any medical problems, talk to your doctor before you start any exercise program. Some exercises may not be recommended. Stop doing any activity that causes pain or makes pain worse."
340,What can you do to improve your posture?,"Some of these muscles move your torso by flexing, extending, or rotating your spine. Others stabilize your pelvis and spine in a natural, neutral position. Old-style sit-ups used only a few of these muscles, often with jerky momentum. Today's yoga, Pilates, and core fitness programs target your entire core with slow, controlled movements to get the most out of your workout. Repeat five to 10 times, adding more as your core gets stronger Increase the Intensity: The closer your straight leg is to the floor, the harder the work for your core."
341,What is the current solution for antibiotic resistance?,"In 2015, the White House created a National Action Plan for Combatting Antibiotic Resistance. Its recommendations include: Scientists should step up the development of new antibiotics and vaccines as well as diagnostic tests to identify drug-resistant bacteria. Public health officials should monitor antibiotic resistance and track its spread. Doctors should help stop unnecessary antibiotic use and develop safer practices in hospitals and clinics. Farmers should stop giving animals antibiotics needed to treat diseases in people."
341,How do bacteria become antibiotic resistant?,"Some bacteria can naturally resist certain kinds of antibiotics. Others can become resistant if their genes change or they get drug-resistant genes from other bacteria. The longer and more often antibiotics are used, the less effective they are against those bacteria."
341,How many infections are resistance to antibiotics?,"Each year, an estimated 2 million people in the U. S. develop infections that are resistant to antibiotics. In some cases, these infections result in death."
341,How can antibiotic resistance affect chronic diseases?,"Resistance also makes it more difficult to care for people with chronic diseases. Some people need medical treatments like chemotherapy, surgery, or dialysis, and they sometimes take antibiotics to help reduce the risk of infection."
342,What are the potential benefits of digital mammography?,"More analysis. Because digital mammograms are stored electronically, they can be analyzed by computers as well as by radiologists. Easier second opinions. They can easily be sent electronically for analysis. More to see. The images can be manipulated for better clarity and visibility. Film mammogram can't. Lower average radiation dosage. Digital mammograms often take more views of each breast than the film kind -- but they use about 25% less radiation. That's because smaller areas of the breast are imaged in each view. Easier to store. The digital images stay on a computer."
342,How common are digital mammograms?,"Most mammogram facilities in the U. S. now have digital capabilities. But If you can't get the digital kind, that doesn't mean you should skip getting a film mammogram."
342,How well do digital mammograms work?,"The women were screened using both types of tests. Breast cancer was found in 335 of the women. The researchers determined that digital mammograms did a better job with detection for three groups of women: Under age 50 Had dense breasts Hadn't yet gone through menopause, or had been in menopause less than a year If you fall into one of these groups, talk with your doctor about having a digital mammogram."
342,What are popular screening methods for breast cancer?,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the U. The images are checked for anything irregular, and doctors also look for changes from previous tests. The images were recorded on film for many years. But now digital mammograms can store and analyze the information using a computer. She then takes images of your breast from top to bottom and side to side."
342,How common is breast cancer in the United States?,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the U. The images are checked for anything irregular, and doctors also look for changes from previous tests. Breast cancer was found in 335 of the women."
343,What else should you know about orlistat (Xenical) as a prescription weight loss drug?,"What else you should know: You should be on a low-fat diet (less than 30% of your daily calories from fat) before taking orlistat. Also, take a multivitamin at least 2 hours before or after taking orlistat, because the drug temporarily makes it harder for your body to absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K. Orlistat is the only drug of its kind that's approved in the U. S. All other prescription weight loss drugs curb your appetite, including the following."
343,What are the side effects of Saxenda as a prescription weight loss drug?,"Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, low blood pressure, and increased appetite. Serious side effects can include raised heart rate, pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, kidney problems, and suicidal thoughts."
343,What else should you know about Belviq as a prescription weight loss drug?,"What else you should know: If you don't lose 5% of your weight after 12 weeks of taking Contrave, your doctor may tell you to stop taking it, because it's unlikely to work for you, the FDA says."
343,What are the side effect of Qsymia as a prescription weight loss drug?,"Side effects: The most common side effects are tingling hands and feet, dizziness, altered sense of taste, insomnia, constipation, and dry mouth.

343,What are the side effects of orlistat (Xenical) as a prescription weight loss drug?,"Side effects include abdominal cramping, passing gas, leaking oily stool, having more bowel movements, and not being able to control bowel movements. These side effects are generally mild and temporary."
343,What prescription weight loss drugs are most common?,"Here's what you should know about the most common prescription weight loss drugs: orlistat, Belviq, Contrave, Saxenda, phentermine, and Qsymia."
343,What are the side effects of Contrave as a prescription weight loss drug?,"Side effects: The most common side effects include nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, and dry mouth. Contrave has a boxed warning about the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors associated with bupropion. The warning also notes that serious neuropsychiatric issues linked to bupropion have been reported. Contrave can cause seizures and must not be used in patients who have seizure disorders. The drug can also increase blood pressure and heart rate."
343,What are the side effects of Belviq as a prescription weight loss drug?,"Side effects: The most common side effects in people who don't have diabetes include headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, and constipation. The most common side effects in those who have diabetes are low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), headache, back pain, cough, and fatigue. People taking some depression medications with lorcaserin need to be monitored very closely for a rare but serious reaction that includes fever and confusion."
343,What else should you know about Qsymia as a prescription weight loss drug?,"What else you should know: If you don't lose at least 3% of your weight after 12 weeks on Qsymia, the FDA recommends that you stop taking it or that your doctor increase your dose for the next 12 weeks -- and if that doesn't work, you should gradually stop taking it."
343,How does Belviq work as a prescription weight loss drug?,Approved for long-term use? How it works: Curbs your appetite.
343,How does orlistat (Xenical) work as a prescription weight loss drug?,"How it works: Blocks your body from absorbing about a third of the fat you eat. When a doctor prescribes orlistat, it's called Xenical. If you get it without a prescription, it's called Alli, which has half of Xenical's dose. Approved for long-term use?"
343,What are the side effect of phentermine as a prescription weight loss drug?,"Also, take a multivitamin at least 2 hours before or after taking orlistat, because the drug temporarily makes it harder for your body to absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K. Orlistat is the only drug of its kind that's approved in the U. S. All other prescription weight loss drugs curb your appetite, including the following. Side effects: The most common side effects include nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, and dry mouth. The drug can also increase blood pressure and heart rate. What else you should know: If you don't lose 5% of your weight after 12 weeks of taking Contrave, your doctor may tell you to stop taking it, because it's unlikely to work for you, the FDA says. Liraglutide has been shown in studies to cause thyroid tumors in animals, but it is not yet known if it can cause thyroid cancer in humans."
343,How does Saxenda work as a prescription weight loss drug?,Approved for long-term use? How it works: Liraglutide is a higher dose of the type 2 diabetes drug Victoza. It mimics an intestinal hormone that tells the brain your stomach is full.
344,How can working around harmful chemicals cause bladder cancer?,"People who work in certain industries (painters, machinists, printers, hairdressers, and truck drivers, among others) may be exposed to harmful chemicals for long periods of time. This can increase their risk of disease."
344,What is the outlook for people with bladder cancer?,"The 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer is about 77%. That means that about 7 out of 10 people who are diagnosed with the disease will still be alive 5 years later. But that's just an estimate. Your outcome is based on your unique situation. That includes things like your age, overall health, how early the cancer was found, and how well it responds to treatment."

344,What causes bladder cancer?,"It accounts for just 5% of all new cancers in the U. S. Doctors aren't sure. But they do know that several things increase your risk for the disease. They include: Genetic makeup, race, and family history."
344,How can genes cause bladder cancer?,"Bladder cancer is most common in white men over age 55. If you or someone in your immediate family (parents or siblings) has had cancer of the bladder or the urinary tract before, you're more likely to get it."
344,How can smoking cause bladder cancer?,Research shows that smoking is the cause of about 50% of all bladder cancers. Working around harmful chemicals.
344,What is the role of the bladder?,"Tubes called ureters carry the pee from your kidneys to your bladder. When you use the bathroom, the muscles in your bladder push the urine out through a tube called the urethra. In severe cases, it can spread to distant parts of your body, including your bones, lungs, or liver."
344,How common is bladder cancer?,It accounts for just 5% of all new cancers in the U. S. Doctors aren't sure. The 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer is about 77%.
344,How can taking certain diabetes medications cause bladder cancer?,"If you have bladder infections that keep coming back or another condition that causes your bladder to be irritated for long periods of time, you stand a better chance of getting bladder cancer. Other diabetes meds that contain pioglitazone ( Actoplus Met and Duetact) can also raise your risk."

If you have bladder infections that keep coming back or another condition that causes your bladder to be irritated for long periods of time, you stand a better chance of getting bladder cancer."
345,What should one expect after a root canal?,"For the first few days following the completion of a root canal, the tooth may feel sensitive due to natural tissue inflammation, especially if there was pain or infection before the procedure. This sensitivity or discomfort usually can be controlled with over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve). Most patients can return to their normal activities the next day. Until your root canal procedure is completely finished -- that is to say, the permanent filling is in place and/or the crown, it's wise to minimize chewing on the tooth under repair. This step will help avoid recontamination of the interior of the tooth and also may prevent a fragile tooth from breaking before the tooth can be fully restored. Embed Asset Override As far as oral health care is concerned, brush, floss, and use an antiseptic mouthwash as you regularly would and see your dentist at normally scheduled intervals."
345,How successful are root canals?,"The root canal procedure is the treatment of choice. The only alternative to a root canal procedure is having the tooth extracted and replaced with a bridge, implant, or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting."
345,How can you prevent a root canal?,"Embed Asset Override Since some of the reasons why the nerve of a tooth and its pulp become inflamed and infected are due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth and/or large fillings, following good oral hygiene practices (brushing twice a day, flossing at least once a day, and scheduling regular dental visits) may reduce the need for a root canal procedure. Trauma resulting from a sports-related injury can be reduced by wearing a mouth guard."
345,Why does tooth pulp need to be removed?,"When a tooth's nerve tissue or pulp is damaged, it breaks down and bacteria begin to multiply within the pulp chamber. The bacteria and other decayed debris can cause an infection or abscessed tooth. An abscess is a pus-filled pocket that forms at the end of the roots of the tooth. An abscess occurs when the infection spreads all the way past the ends of the roots of the tooth. In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause: Embed Asset Override Swelling that may spread to other areas of the face, neck, or head Bone loss around the tip of the root Drainage problems extending outward from the root. A hole can occur through the side of the tooth with drainage into the gums or through the cheek with drainage into the skin."
345,What does a root canal require?,"A root canal requires one or more office visits and can be performed by a dentist or endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist who specializes in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and injuries of the human dental pulp or the nerve of the tooth. The choice of which type of dentist to use depends to some degree on the difficulty of the root canal procedure needed in your particular tooth and the general dentist's comfort level in working on your tooth. Your dentist will discuss who might be best suited to perform the work in your particular case."
345,What are potential complications after a root canal?,"Despite your dentist's best efforts to clean and seal a tooth, new infections might emerge after a root canal. Among the likely reasons for this include: Embed Asset Override More than the normally anticipated number of root canals in a tooth (leaving one of them uncleaned) An undetected crack in the root of a tooth A defective or inadequate dental restoration that has allowed bacteria to get past the restoration into the inner aspects of the tooth and recontaminate the area A breakdown of the inner sealing material over time, allowing bacteria to recontaminate the inner aspects of the tooth Sometimes retreatment can be successful, other times endodontic surgery must be tried in order to save the tooth."
345,What are alternatives to a root canal?,"The only alternative to a root canal procedure is having the tooth extracted and replaced with a bridge, implant, or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting. These alternatives not only are more expensive than a root canal procedure but require more treatment time and additional procedures to adjacent teeth and supporting tissues."
345,How is the tooth filled in a root canal?,"If the root canal is not completed on the same day, a temporary filling is placed in the exterior hole in the tooth to keep out contaminants like saliva and food between appointments. At the next appointment, to fill the interior of the tooth, a sealer paste and a rubber compound called gutta percha is placed into the tooth's root canal. To fill the exterior access hole created at the beginning of treatment, a filling is placed."
345,What damages a tooth's nerve and pulp in the first place?,"A tooth's nerve and pulp can become irritated, inflamed, and infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on a tooth, and/or large fillings, a crack or chip in the tooth, or trauma to the face."
345,What is a root canal?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form. "" Root canal"" is the term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal. The tooth's nerve lies within the root canal."
345,What is the cost of a root canal?,"A ballpark estimate for the root canal treatment itself (not including a dental restoration following the procedure) performed by a general dentist could range from $500 to $1,000 for an incisor and $800 to $1,500 for a molar. The fees charged by endodontists could be up to 50% higher."
345,What happens in a root canal?,"In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause: Embed Asset Override Swelling that may spread to other areas of the face, neck, or head Bone loss around the tip of the root Drainage problems extending outward from the root. Your dentist or endodontist will then use local anesthesia to numb the area near the tooth. An access hole will then be drilled into the tooth. The pulp along with bacteria, the decayed nerve tissue and related debris is removed from the tooth. The cleaning out process is accomplished using root canal files. A series of these files of increasing diameter are each subsequently placed into the access hole and worked down the full length of the tooth to scrape and scrub the sides of the root canals. Water or sodium hypochlorite is used periodically to flush away the debris. At the next appointment, to fill the interior of the tooth, a sealer paste and a rubber compound called gutta percha is placed into the tooth's root canal. These alternatives not only are more expensive than a root canal procedure but require more treatment time and additional procedures to adjacent teeth and supporting tissues."
345,What are the final steps in a root canal?,"Your dentist will discuss the need for any additional dental work with you. Also, because the final step of the root canal procedure is application of a restoration such as a crown or a filling, it will not be obvious to onlookers that a root canal was performed."

Fluid made by glands inside the vagina and cervix carries away dead cells and bacteria. This keeps the vagina clean and helps prevent infection. Most of the time, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal. The amount can vary, as can odor and color (which can range from clear to a milky white-ish), depending on the time in your menstrual cycle. For example, there will be more discharge when you're ovulating, breastfeeding, or sexually aroused. It may smell different when you're pregnant or you've been letting your personal hygiene slide. None of those changes is cause for alarm. However, if the color, smell, or consistency seems quite different than usual, especially if you also have vaginal itching or burning, you could be dealing with an infection or other condition."
346,What are some tips for preventing abnormal vaginal discharge?,"These are a few of the things that can upset that balance: Antibiotic or steroid use Bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial infection more common in pregnant women or women who have multiple sexual partners Birth control pills Cervical cancer Chlamydia or gonorrhea ( STDs), sexually transmitted infections Diabetes Douches, scented soaps or lotions, bubble bath Pelvic infection after surgery Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) Trichomoniasis, a parasitic infection typically contracted and caused by having unprotected sex Vaginal atrophy, the thinning and drying out of the vaginal walls during menopause Vaginitis, irritation in or around the vagina Yeast infections See the chart below to learn more about what a particular type of discharge might mean. Never use scented soaps and feminine products or douche. Also avoid feminine sprays and bubble baths.

You'll remain awake during the procedure, but the area around the vein will be numbed. It's an outpatient procedure, meaning there is no overnight stay."
347,Can varicose veins cause medical problems?,"But in some people, they can lead to pain that interferes with walking or standing. They can also cause blood clots, skin ulcers, infections, and other troubles. If lifestyle changes don't help, if varicose veins become more severe, or if you're bothered by the appearance of your varicose or spider veins, talk to your doctor about what medical treatments are available."
347,How can endovenous ablation therapy help in treating varicose and spider veins?,"Endovenous ablation therapy In this procedure, doctors close off varicose veins by using lasers or high-frequency radio waves within the vein to create intense heat. Your doctor will make a tiny cut near the vein and insert a small catheter. A device at the tip of the catheter heats up the inside of the vessel and closes it off. Compared to an older procedure called vein stripping and ligation, in which veins are tied shut and removed through small cuts in the skin, ablation therapy closes off varicose veins but leaves them in place, resulting in minimal bleeding and bruising."
347,What are some lifestyle changes that can improve symptoms of varicose and spider veins?,"Some things you can try include: Not standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. Losing extra weight to improve blood flow and ease pressure on your veins. Not wearing tight clothing, especially around your waist, upper thighs, and legs. Avoiding crossing your legs at your knees and ankles. Doing physical activities that move your legs, which will improve muscle tone."

352,How do you know if your edema is caused by allergic reactions?,"Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area."
352,How is edema treated?,"For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation."
352,What medications can cause edema?,"Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema."
352,How do you know if your edema is caused by obstruction of flow?,"If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema."
352,How do you know if your edema is caused by kidney disease?,A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema.
352,How do you know if your edema is caused by liver disease?,"Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema."
352,What does edema mean?,"It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies."
352,How do you know if your edema is caused by heart disease (congestive heart failure)?,"If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema."
352,What causes an edema?,"In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. Kidney disease. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms."

This is often the first symptom of breast cancer. Lumps associated with breast cancer are usually painless, although some may cause a prickly sensation. Lumps are usually visible on a mammogram long before you can see or feel them. Swelling in your armpit or collarbone could mean breast cancer has spread to lymph nodes in that area. Although lumps are usually painless, pain or tenderness can be a sign of breast cancer. This could be a tumor that you can't see or feel. You might notice a difference in the size, contour, texture, or temperature of your breast. A reddish, pitted surface like the skin of an orange could be a sign of advanced breast cancer.

It's there the whole time, but it's turned off. It just hangs out and waits. To turn it on, your body releases a substance known as an activator. It wakes up plasmin and tells it to get to work tearing things down. That mainly means breaking up the mesh-like structure that helps the clot work so well."
354,How do thrombolytics clear clots?,"Also called anticoagulants, these are some of the more common drugs for a deep vein thrombosis ( DVT). That gives your body time to break up the clot. They work by turning on plasmin, which jump-starts your body's natural process for clearing things out."

395,Can I get disability because of fibromyalgia?,"To address concentration issues, employers should consider: Providing written job instructions when possible Prioritizing job assignments and providing more structure Allowing flexible work hours and allowing a self-paced workload Allowing periodic rest periods to reorient Providing memory aids, such as schedulers or organizers Minimizing distractions Reducing job stress To address depression and anxiety, employers should consider: Reducing distractions in the work environment Providing to-do lists and written instructions Reminding the employee of important deadlines and meetings Allowing time off for counseling Providing clear expectations of responsibilities and consequences Providing sensitivity training to coworkers Allowing breaks to use stress management techniques Developing strategies to deal with work problems before they arise Allowing telephone calls during work hours to doctors and others for support Providing information on counseling and employee assistance programs To address fatigue and weakness, employers should consider: Reducing or eliminating physical exertion and workplace stress Scheduling periodic rest breaks away from the workstation Allowing a flexible work schedule and flexible use of leave time Allowing the employee to work from home Implementing ergonomic workstation design To address migraine headaches, employers should consider: Providing task lighting Eliminating fluorescent lighting Providing air purification devices Allowing flexible work hours and work from home Allowing periodic rest breaks To address issues associated with sleep problems, employers should consider: Allowing flexible work hours and frequent breaks Allowing the employee to work from home The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA) does not contain a list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA has a general definition of disability that each person must meet. Therefore, some people with fibromyalgia will have a disability under the ADA and others will not. Because fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose -- typically, health care providers rule out other conditions through a physical exam and various blood tests -- it's important that you do your homework before you apply for disability. According to federal regulations, to qualify for disability you must prove that you have a severe impairment. You also need to prove that the impairment limits your physical or mental ability to do work. The Social Security disability regulations define disability as ""the inability to do any substantial gainful activity due to your medical or mental problem."" In addition, according to the Social Security Administration, your condition must interfere with basic work-related activities. If it doesn't, your claim won't be considered. Instead, Social Security will find that you are not disabled. The combined effect of having multiple impairments is taken into account. That can be important for many people with fibromyalgia. You must be unable to do your previous work or any other substantial gainful activity. Your age and education are considered, as well as your remaining abilities and your work experience."
395,What type of documentation is needed to get disability for fibromyalgia?,"If more detailed information is needed, you may have to be examined by a doctor approved by the Social Security Administration. It's important to get detailed documentation -- reports -- from your doctors, including psychologists, at the onset of your illness. Have your doctors submit documentation of all prescribed medications, therapies, and lifestyle remedies necessary to resolve your fibromyalgia symptoms. This doctor will give a detailed assessment of your impairment along with a list of the many tests and treatments used in your condition. For further details on disability and the steps you must take, visit the Social Security website or call the local Social Security office."
395,What should you know about working with fibromyalgia?,"Disability may be difficult to get, however, because of rules about work capacity. Talk about the symptoms of pain, fatigue, and stiffness. In addition, ask if you can put a cot in your office for a brief nap at lunchtime. That can be important for many people with fibromyalgia."
395,How do I apply for disability if I have fibromyalgia?,"You will be asked specific questions about how you have trouble with daily activities. And you will need to be as specific as you can, describing your limitations and why you cannot work. You will be asked to give the names and addresses of your doctors. The Social Security office will contact each one for records. If more detailed information is needed, you may have to be examined by a doctor approved by the Social Security Administration. For further details on disability and the steps you must take, visit the Social Security website or call the local Social Security office."
396,Can a pregnant woman pass genital herpes to her baby?,"A pregnant woman can pass genital herpes on to her baby, so it's particularly serious during pregnancy. If you get infected near the end of pregnancy, the risk is highest. At least 30% and as many as 50% of newly infected pregnant women give the virus to their babies. For moms who were infected long before delivery, the risk is much lower. Less than 1% of babies born to mothers with an older genital herpes infection get the virus."
396,How can you reduce the risk of passing genital herpes to your partner?,"You can reduce the risk to your partner by having sex only when you have no symptoms. However, the virus can still be contagious without any noticeable symptoms such as sores or a rash on the skin. That's why you should always use a latex condom. A condom does not completely eliminate the risk, because it may not cover an affected area, but it does offer some protection. Taking the antiviral drugs acyclovir ( Zovirax), famciclovir ( Famvir), and valacyclovir ( Valtrex) can make symptoms appear less often and make them less severe."
397,What is respiratory distress in children and what are the signs and causes?,"Respiratory Distress Respiratory distress refers to difficulty breathing and taking in enough oxygen. Causes may include choking, asthma, an infection, or pneumonia. The signs of respiratory distress are coughing, wheezing, labored breathing (especially flaring of the nose and use of chest and neck muscles to aid breathing), grunting, inability to talk, or turning blue."
397,When are vomiting and/or diarrhea in children an emergency?,"Vomiting and/or Diarrhea Vomiting and/or diarrhea can require emergency care if a child becomes dehydrated. If your child can't keep anything down or has severe diarrhea, watch for signs of dehydration such as sunken eyes, dry mucus membranes, and abnormally low amounts of urine. If any of these appear your child should be evaluated by the doctor When to Call 911: The child is unresponsive."
397,Should I take my child to the hospital because of a broken bone?,"Broken Bones Broken bones are common childhood emergencies. While these injuries are usually not life-threatening, the child should be taken to a hospital or urgent care center for evaluation. Generally speaking, parents can drive kids with broken bones to the hospital themselves."
398,What is a tubular adenoma?,"The most common types of colon polyps doctors remove are a type called tubular adenoma. It can become cancerous, and that danger goes up the bigger the polyps get."
398,Do colon polyps raise your risk of colon cancer?,"If you have a history of polyps in your colon, you're more likely to get colon cancer. Screening is your best way to prevent that. Doctors generally recommend getting your first colonoscopy at age 50. You may need to start at age 40 or earlier if someone in your family has had serious polyps or colon cancer."
398,What are symptoms of tubular adenomas?,"You're more likely to get tubular adenomas if you are: 50 or older Obese Male From a family with history of colon polyps A couch potato You may not know you have tubular adenomas until your doctor finds them during a colonoscopy. But you may notice: Bleeding in your bottom Mucus in your poop Frequent diarrhea or constipation Belly cramps Anemia, from losing blood in your poop During a colonoscopy, your doctor inserts a long, flexible tube with a lens into your rectum and slowly threads it into your colon."
398,How do tubular adenomas form?,"These small clumps of cells that form on your colon lining are usually harmless. But some of them can lead to colon cancer. You can get a less common but more serious type of polyps called villous adenomas. Instead of round or oval, they look shaggy, like a cauliflower. Some polyps combine the two growth patterns, and they're called tubulovillous adenomas. They can grow slowly, over a decade or more."
398,How likely are tubular adenomas to become cancerous?,"Just like the name, they grow in a tube shape. Any tubular adenomas will show up as a lump sticking out from the lining of your colon. No matter what the lab results say, the important thing is that all the polyps are out. If you've had tubular or any other types of adenomas, you'll need to have a follow-up colonoscopy to make sure they don't return."
398,How can a colonoscopy find tubular adenomas?,"But you may notice: Bleeding in your bottom Mucus in your poop Frequent diarrhea or constipation Belly cramps Anemia, from losing blood in your poop During a colonoscopy, your doctor inserts a long, flexible tube with a lens into your rectum and slowly threads it into your colon. She can see the images on a video monitor. Your doctor will snip off the polyp or loop a wire around it and burn it off with electric current. Your doctor will send the polyp to a lab. A pathologist will check it under a microscope to see how much the sample looks like cancer. Usually, you'll need a repeat procedure every 3-5 years."
399,How can a walking aid help with knee pain?,A crutch or cane can take the stress off of your knee. Knee splints and braces can also help you stay stable.
399,How can acupuncture help with knee pain?,"This form of traditional Chinese medicine, which involves inserting fine needles at certain points on the body, is widely used to relieve many types of pain and may help knee pain."
399,How should I rest to help with knee pain?,"Don't rest too much. Too much rest can weaken your muscles, which can worsen joint pain. Do exercise. To find the appropriate insole, speak with your doctor or a physical therapist."
399,How can my shoes affect knee pain?,"Don't overlook your weight. If you're overweight, losing weight reduces the stress on your knee. You don't even need to get to your ""ideal"" weight. To find the appropriate insole, speak with your doctor or a physical therapist."
400,What are the risks of taking ginkgo?,"Do not eat untreated parts of the ginkgo plant. Uncooked ginkgo seeds can cause seizures and death. Interactions. If you take any medicines or supplements regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using ginkgo supplements."
400,Who should not take ginkgo?,"Given the potential risks, ginkgo is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
400,What are the side effects of taking ginkgo?,"Ginkgo leaf supplements are generally safe. In some people, they can cause headache, dizziness, heart palpitations, nausea, gas, and diarrhea. Allergies to ginkgo can trigger rashes or more serious effects."
400,Why do people take ginkgo?,"Ginkgo improves blood flow to the brain and acts as an antioxidant. These effects may translate into some benefits for certain medical problems, but the results have been mixed. Some studies have found that in healthy people, ginkgo might modestly boost memory and cognitive speed. Other studies have not found a benefit. Several ginkgo studies have shown that it can help with memory problems caused by dementia or Alzheimer's disease. It seems to help prevent the progression of dementia symptoms, especially if the dementia is thought to be the result of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It does not seem to prevent dementia or Alzheimer's, however. There's good evidence that ginkgo might ease leg pain caused by clogged arteries. It might also help with some other circulation problems. In addition, ginkgo may relieve PMS symptoms, like breast tenderness and mood changes. Researchers have studied ginkgo for many other conditions, including ADHD, depression and other psychological conditions, multiple sclerosis, and tinnitus from a vascular origin. Some people are also using ginkgo to prevent high altitude sickness, though studies have not yet established that it's effective for that. Many uses of ginkgo show promise, but more research needs to be done."
400,What is ginkgo?,"Some studies have found that in healthy people, ginkgo might modestly boost memory and cognitive speed. Most ginkgo supplements are derived from the leaves."
400,What are the interactions when taking ginkgo?,"If you have a bleeding disorder, or are planning surgery, talk to your doctor before using ginkgo. Ginkgo might reduce the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT.)"
400,Can you get ginkgo naturally from foods?,"It seems to help prevent the progression of dementia symptoms, especially if the dementia is thought to be the result of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Most ginkgo supplements are derived from the leaves."
401,What helps you pay attention in conversations if you have ADHD?,"Simple steps can make any conversation easier. Make sure you: Are face-to-face with the other person when you're talking to them Listen carefully when they're speaking Don't interrupt Ask questions when you don't understand something Let the other person know you understand them by using phrases like â It sounds like you're saying,â or â Tell me if I'm hearing you right ...â You might feel like the people closest to you are constantly criticizing or nagging you."
402,What non-drug treatments can help with treating bipolar disorder?,"Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone."
402,What medications are used to treat bipolar depression?,"For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression."
402,What Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs are approved for the treatment of bipolar depression?,"Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression."
402,What will happen if your mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder?,"If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania."
402,How do people respond to medications for bipolar disorder?,"Many people respond well to medications for bipolar disorder. For many others, the symptoms do not completely disappear despite therapy. The mood symptoms may become less intense and more manageable, however. Remember, getting your diagnosis should come as a relief. Now you know what the problem has been and you're on the road to getting the right treatment."
402,How can electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) help with treating bipolar depression?,"If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression."
402,What is the best treatment for bipolar disorder?,The exact causes of bipolar disorder are unknown. Other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) are often successful for people with very severe symptoms who don't respond to traditional therapy or who can't take the medications.
402,How can mood stabilizers help with treating bipolar disorder?,"They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias."
403,What do low-density lipoproteins (LDL) levels mean?,"Total blood cholesterol level: High risk: 240 mg/d L and above Borderline high risk: 200-239 mg/d L Desirable: Less than 200 mg/d L LDL cholesterol levels: 190 mg/d L and above represents a high risk for heart disease and is a strong indicator that the individual can benefit from intensive treatment, including life style changes, diet, and statin therapy for reducing that risk. For LDL levels that are equal to or less than 189 mg/d L, the guidelines recommend strategies for lowering LDL by 30% to 50% depending on what other risk factors you have that can affect the health of your heart and blood vessels."
403,What other factors might your doctor consider with regards to cholesterol and heart disease?,"After reviewing your blood test, The doctor will also consider other risk factors you might have for heart disease, including: Your family history Age Weight Race Gender Diet Blood pressure and whether or not you're being treated for high blood pressure Activity level Smoking status History of diabetes Evidence of elevated blood sugars Then, your doctor will talk with you about your level of risk and the potential benefit to be derived by taking steps that include changes in your level of activity and diet as well as using medication to improve your cholesterol levels in order to reduce your overall risk."
403,What are normal and high triglyceride levels?,"HDL cholesterol: High risk: Less than 40 mg/d L for men and less than 50 mg/d L for women Triglycerides: Very high risk: 500 mg/d L and above High risk: 200-499 mg/d L Borderline high risk: 150-199 mg/d L Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L If your doctor recommends a ""non-fasting"" cholesterol test, the lab will look only at your total cholesterol (and sometimes your HDL) numbers."
403,What is low-density lipoproteins (LDL)?,"This is the ""bad cholesterol,"" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. In general, the lower the number, the better. But LDL cholesterol is only one part of a larger equation that measures a person's overall risk of having a heart attack or stroke. For years, guidelines focused on specific target numbers for individuals to achieve to lower their risk. The most recent guidelines focus on a person's overall risk and, based on that risk, recommend a certain percentage of LDL reduction as one part of a strategy for preventing serious heart and vascular problems."
403,"What are the high, borderline and desirable levels of total cholesterol?","HDL cholesterol: High risk: Less than 40 mg/d L for men and less than 50 mg/d L for women Triglycerides: Very high risk: 500 mg/d L and above High risk: 200-499 mg/d L Borderline high risk: 150-199 mg/d L Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L If your doctor recommends a ""non-fasting"" cholesterol test, the lab will look only at your total cholesterol (and sometimes your HDL) numbers."
403,What is high-density lipoproteins (HDL)?,"This is the ""bad cholesterol,"" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. It transports bad cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it is excreted by the body. Your HDL is another part of the equation that identifies the risk of a cardiovascular event. In general, the higher the number the better, although, as with LDL, the emphasis has shifted from specific target numbers to strategies for reducing the overall risk."
404,How should you adjust your treatment for rheumatoid arthritis if you are family planning?,"As soon as you're considering starting a family, see your rheumatologist. Some drugs need a months-long ""washout"" period before trying to conceive. And that goes for men as well as women; although unproven, methotrexate might result in sperm problems that could cause birth defects. If you're taking leflunomide for RA, even more advance planning is necessary. Due to its long half-life, leflunomide needs to be stopped two years before trying to conceive a baby, although there are ways to ""wash"" it out of your system quicker."
404,What is the future of rheumatoid arthritis treatment?,"New biologic drugs for RA have created a new era of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, according to rheumatologists. With early and aggressive treatment, most people with RA can avoid joint deformities and major disability."
404,Does rheumatoid arthritis affect your fertility?,"Experts disagree whether rheumatoid arthritis reduces fertility in women or men. It's true that many women with RA take longer to conceive than women without rheumatoid arthritis. Inconsistent ovulation, decreased sex drive, or having sex less often due to pain and fatigue are possible explanations. For men, acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis temporarily reduce sperm count and function, and can cause erection problems and decreased libido. For both men and women, effective treatment for RA improves sexual symptoms and function. In well-treated rheumatoid arthritis, fertility in most men and women is probably normal."
404,How can your doctor help with family planning if you have rheumatoid arthritis?,"Your rheumatologist will help you decide on a treatment plan that includes both control of your RA symptoms and safety for your baby. Low-dose prednisone, forexample, is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine are also considered safe. While evidence is limited for biologic medicines like etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi), infliximab ( Remicade), and infliximab-abda ( Renflexis) or infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), biosimilars, many rheumatologists are confident in their relative safety during pregnancy. One way to avoid the risk of pregnancy problems from RA medications is to simply not take any. Under a doctor's supervision, some women quit RA drugs ""cold turkey"" when they begin trying to conceive. This method has its own risk, of course: possible progression of joint damage from flares during the time when you are off treatment. In certain women, though, some rheumatologists endorse the approach, with close monitoring for disease activity."
404,Can rheumatoid arthritis hurt your baby?,"Rheumatoid arthritis itself doesn't seem to harm the developing baby, even if RA is active during pregnancy. In fact, 70% to 80% of women with RA have improvement of their symptoms during pregnancy. Although some women with RA may have a slight risk of miscarriage or low-birth-weight babies, the vast majority of women have normal pregnancies without complications. However, many drugs for rheumatoid arthritis -- including methotrexate ( Otrexup, Rheumatrex, Trexall) and leflunomide ( Arava) -- can cause birth defects. These same medications may also cause birth defects if they are taken by men who father children. Therefore, it's important to talk to your doctor about altering treatment several months before you or your spouse try to get pregnant."
404,How should you use contraception if you have rheumatoid arthritis and are family planning?,"One way to avoid the risk of pregnancy problems from RA medications is to simply not take any. Experts say that used properly, a variety of methods are appropriateand effective, such as: Condoms Oral contraceptives Vaginal ring Intrauterine device ( IUD) Although controversial studies have suggested oral contraceptives might prevent rheumatoid arthritis in some women, there is no evidence that they help control RA symptoms."
405,How is congenital heart disease diagnosed?,"If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure."
406,How is juvenile osteoporosis diagnosed?,"The signs and symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis include: Pain in the lower back, hips, knees, ankles, and feet Trouble with walking Fractures in the legs, ankles, or feet Juvenile osteoporosis is hard to define. Bone density scans are the most accurate way to detect lowered bone mass early on, but they need to be interpreted carefully to make a clear diagnosis in children. Instead, doctors usually diagnose juvenile when there are signs that a child has a fragile skeleton. This might show up when a child's bone breaks without something like a bad fall or other trauma, and the child has a low bone mineral density score."
406,What is idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis?,"Idiopathic osteoporosis means that doctors don't know what caused the disease. This type of juvenile osteoporosis is much less common. It seems to be more common in boys than in girls. It usually starts just before puberty. The child's bone density may mostly recover during puberty, but still not quite be normal when bone mass peaks as an adult."
406,How do I take care of a child affected by juvenile osteoporosis?,"It's very important to protect your child's bones from fracture. He may need to use crutches or other supports. He may also need to avoid types of exercise, such as contact sports, that could cause a fracture. Your doctor can tell you what's OK. All children, including those with juvenile osteoporosis, need a lifestyle that helps build healthy bones. This includes a diet rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, and as much safe physical activity as possible. It's best to avoid caffeine. Many experts also suggest that children with juvenile osteoporosis get bone density tests at least every other year into adulthood."
406,What are signs and symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis?,"The signs and symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis include: Pain in the lower back, hips, knees, ankles, and feet Trouble with walking Fractures in the legs, ankles, or feet Juvenile osteoporosis is hard to define."
406,What are kinds of juvenile osteoporosis?,There are two kinds of juvenile osteoporosis: secondary and idiopathic.
406,How is juvenile osteoporosis treated?,"Secondary osteoporosis means that another medical condition is to blame. If your child has one of these conditions, talk to his doctor about checking on his bone density. None of the osteoporosis drugs that adults can take are approved for use in children."
407,Can ADHD medicine lead to tics?,"Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant."
407,How can you treat a lowered appetite resulting from taking ADHD medicine?,"Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight."
407,How long do the aches and nausea from taking ADHD medicine last?,"Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food."
407,Can ADHD medicine lead to suicidal thoughts?,"Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately."
407,Can ADHD medicine lead to liver damage?,"Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain."
407,Can ADHD medicine lead to heart problems?,"Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication."
407,Can ADHD medicine lead to personality changes?,"Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor."
407,How can ADHD medicine lead to fainting and dizziness?,"Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor."
407,Can ADHD medicine lead to changes in growth?,"Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants."
407,How can you treat the irritability or moodiness associated with taking ADHD medicine?,"Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill."
407,Is it normal for ADHD medicine to cause hallucinations?,"Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor."
407,What ADHD medicines don't cause sleeping problems?,"Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help."
407,Can antidepressants be used to treat ADHD?,"Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression."
407,Is it normal for ADHD medicine to cause my child to faint or become dizzy?,"Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor."

407,Does ADHD medicine cause changes in a child's height or weight?,"Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary."
407,How can you treat insomnia related to taking ADHD medicine?,"In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help."
407,Is it normal for ADHD medicine to cause aches and nausea?,"Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food."
407,Is it normal for ADHD medicine to cause a loss in appetite?,"Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight."
407,Are side effects of ADHD medicine common and when should I be concerned?,"Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication."
407,"Is it normal for ADHD medicine to cause my child to be irritable and moody, and what can I do to help it?","Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day."
407,Does bupropion have different side effects from stimulants?,"Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics. At high doses, it may make some people more likely to have seizures and can cause hallucinations."
407,Can serious side effects occur from taking ADHD medicine?,"If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease."
407,What are the side effects of taking antidepressants to treat ADHD?,"Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. At high doses, it may make some people more likely to have seizures and can cause hallucinations."
407,What should you know about ADHD medicine?,"But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones."
408,Who usually gets a tailbone (coccyx) injury?,"The majority of coccyx injuries occur in women, because the female pelvis is broader and the coccyx is more exposed."
408,What exams and tests are used for a tailbone (coccyx) injury?,"The entire vertebral column (spine) may be examined. A neurologic exam may be performed. A rectal exam may also be performed. For this exam, the doctor inserts a finger into your rectum to feel the area of the coccyx and determine if there is a dislocation or a fracture that can be felt and if direct pressure against the coccyx reproduces your pain. Rarely, if the cause of discomfort is unknown, a local anesthetic may be injected into the tailbone area to determine whether the origin of the pain is from the coccyx or another part of the vertebral column. X-rays may be taken to determine whether there is a fracture or dislocation. However, X-rays occasionally may not reveal these injuries. Some doctors recommend X-rays in both the standing and seated positions to better determine the presence of a fracture or dislocation."
408,When should you seek medical care for a tailbone (coccyx) injury?,"Injuries to the region of the tailbone rarely require a visit to the emergency department. However, if you are concerned about your symptoms, it is wise to call a doctor or visit the nearest hospital's emergency department. For this exam, the doctor inserts a finger into your rectum to feel the area of the coccyx and determine if there is a dislocation or a fracture that can be felt and if direct pressure against the coccyx reproduces your pain. Rarely, if the cause of discomfort is unknown, a local anesthetic may be injected into the tailbone area to determine whether the origin of the pain is from the coccyx or another part of the vertebral column."
409,Is obesity and inactivity linked to pancreatic cancer?,"In a study of 88,000 nurses, those who were obese (body mass index higher than 30) were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Those who exercised frequently were about half as likely to get pancreatic cancer, compared to those who did not exercise at all."
409,What can you do to prevent pancreatic cancer?,"Eliminating your risk factors for pancreatic cancer won't reduce your risk entirely. But eating a healthy diet, keeping a healthy weight, and exercising frequently will improve overall health, and reduce your risk of other health problems."
409,Who is more likely to get pancreatic cancer?,"People with any of the risk factors are at slightly higher risk than the general population: Genetics. Five percent to 10% of people with pancreatic cancer have an immediate family member who also had it. Several different genes have been associated with the increased risk, although no ""pancreatic cancer gene"" has yet been identified. Diabetes. People with diabetes are not necessarily more likely to get pancreatic cancer but the two have been linked. Smoking. Cigarette smoking is well known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. The more a person smokes, the higher the risk. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk returns to about that of someone who never smoked. Obesity and inactivity. In a study of 88,000 nurses, those who were obese (body mass index higher than 30) were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Those who exercised frequently were about half as likely to get pancreatic cancer, compared to those who did not exercise at all. Pancreatic cysts and chronic pancreatitis. People who have one or both of these are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Diet. A diet high in fat and meat (especially smoked or processed meat) has been linked to pancreatic cancer in animal studies. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables decreased pancreatic cancer risk in other studies. Still other studies suggest there's no identifiable link between diet and pancreatic cancer. Lycopene and selenium. Studies have shown low levels of these nutrients in some people who developed pancreatic cancer. That's not proof that low levels of lycopene and selenium cause pancreatic cancer, though. Any diet that includes lean meat and red or yellow vegetables should provide adequate lycopene and selenium."
409,What are the chances of developing pancreatic cancer?,About one in 76 people will develop pancreatic cancer. This represents the average risk of the condition.
409,Can I prevent pancreatic cancer?,"Eliminating your risk factors for pancreatic cancer won't reduce your risk entirely. But eating a healthy diet, keeping a healthy weight, and exercising frequently will improve overall health, and reduce your risk of other health problems."
409,Does having diabetes mean you're at a higher risk for pancreatic cancer?,Diabetes.
409,Can diet affect the risk for pancreatic cancer?,A diet high in fat and meat (especially smoked or processed meat) has been linked to pancreatic cancer in animal studies. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables decreased pancreatic cancer risk in other studies. Still other studies suggest there's no identifiable link between diet and pancreatic cancer.
409,How does DNA damage lead to pancreatic cancer?,"No one knows exactly how the process of DNA damage leading to pancreatic cancer occurs. Analyzing pancreatic cancers removed by surgery shows certain mutations that occur in nearly all cases, and others that vary between people. Some of these mutations occur randomly. Others occur in response to things we do or experience in the environment. Some mutations may be inherited. When enough mutations accumulate, a cell becomes malignant and a tumor begins to grow."
409,Can smoking cause pancreatic cancer?,"Cigarette smoking is well known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. The more a person smokes, the higher the risk. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk returns to about that of someone who never smoked."
409,How common is pancreatic cancer?,"No one understands the underlying causes of pancreatic cancer, but certain risk factors have been identified. About one in 76 people will develop pancreatic cancer. People who have one or both of these are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer."
409,Is the risk for pancreatic cancer hereditary?,"No one understands the underlying causes of pancreatic cancer, but certain risk factors have been identified. People who have one or both of these are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer."
410,Does caffeine help relieve headaches?,"Whether it's a run-of-the-mill tension headache or a migraine, caffeine can help. That's why it's an ingredient in a lot of popular pain relievers. It can make them as much as 40% more effective. Sometimes you can stop the pain in its tracks just by having caffeine alone."
410,How is caffeine related to a rebound headache?,"A headache is one of the symptoms. This can happen when you have caffeine regularly, even as little as a cup of coffee a day. Too Much Medication: Caffeine can also a factor in what's known as a medication overuse, or rebound headache. This can happen when you take too much of any kind of pain reliever or take it too often. When the medicine wears off, the pain comes back worse than before. When you combine caffeine with pain relievers this condition is more likely."
410,Could you cure your headache with caffeine?,It's possible for caffeine to both cause and cure a headache.
410,Is caffeine connected to headaches?,It's possible for caffeine to both cause and cure a headache.
410,What is caffeine withdrawal and how is it related to headaches?,"Withdrawal: It's easy for your body to get so used to the effects of caffeine that when you don't have it in your system, you have withdrawal. A headache is one of the symptoms. This can happen when you have caffeine regularly, even as little as a cup of coffee a day."
410,Does caffeine help treat hypnic headaches?,"A very rare condition called hypnic headaches responds especially well to caffeine. These strike older people, waking them in the middle of the night with severe pain. Doctors typically tell people who get these to have a cup of coffee before bed."
410,How can caffeine help with your headache?,"Whether it's a run-of-the-mill tension headache or a migraine, caffeine can help. That's why it's an ingredient in a lot of popular pain relievers. It can make them as much as 40% more effective. Sometimes you can stop the pain in its tracks just by having caffeine alone. Caffeine helps reduce inflammation, and that can bring relief. It also gives a boost to common headache remedies. Whether you use aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, they work faster and better and keep the pain away for longer when combined with caffeine. A very rare condition called hypnic headaches responds especially well to caffeine. These strike older people, waking them in the middle of the night with severe pain. Doctors typically tell people who get these to have a cup of coffee before bed."
410,What can you do about drinking caffeine for headaches?,"Be aware of how caffeine affects you, and pay attention to how much of it you drink and eat. If you get migraines, or if you find yourself having headaches frequently, you may want to try to cut down on caffeine or avoid it completely. It's best to do that gradually. For example, if you normally have 2 cups of coffee in the morning, start by cutting back to one. If you quit suddenly, it can take up to a week to get past the withdrawal symptoms. Keep track of your headaches and what seems to help. Get good sleep, and drink plenty of water. A nutritious diet and daily exercise can also help. Try to manage stress. You might be able to beat a headache with relaxation techniques, meditation, or massage instead of using medicine or caffeine."
410,How does caffeine intake negatively affect headaches?,"Oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches. Since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain."

411,How will a doctor know for sure if you had a stroke?,"At the hospital, a doctor will examine the person and run tests to confirm the diagnosis and to see if the stroke was caused by clots or from bleeding in the brain. Tests may include an MRI or a CT scan."
412,What sleep milestones should you expect in your 3-month-old?,"Your 3-month-old's nervous system is maturing, and his stomach can accommodate more milk or formula. Those changes should allow your baby to sleep for a stretch of six or seven hours at a time, which translates into a good night's sleep for you. If your baby does wake up in the middle of the night, wait about 30 seconds before heading into the nursery. Sometimes, babies will cry for a few seconds and then go back to sleep. When you rush in at the first sound of fussing, your baby won't learn how to fall back asleep on his own."
412,When should you call the doctor about missed milestones in your 3-month-old?,"Don't be alarmed if your 3-month-old misses a milestone, especially if he was born prematurely. However, do call your pediatrician if your baby hasn't done the following things by three months: Responded to noises Followed people or objects with his eyes Smiled Reached for objects A number of experts offer advice on parenting, particularly on how to get your baby to sleep through the night."
412,What senses milestones should you expect in your 3-month-old?,"Your 3-month-old's hearing and vision are improving. Babies this age turn their heads and smile at the sound of their parents' voices, and they love listening to all kinds of music. Your baby will still prefer to look at brightly colored toys. That's because sharp contrasts are easier to see. Faces are absolutely fascinating to 3-month-old babies. Look at him and he will stare back into your eyes. Your infant will also gaze intently at his own reflection in a crib mirror."
412,What are some tips for your babyâs third month?,"However, do call your pediatrician if your baby hasn't done the following things by three months: Responded to noises Followed people or objects with his eyes Smiled Reached for objects A number of experts offer advice on parenting, particularly on how to get your baby to sleep through the night. Listen to the advice, but trust your instincts. If letting your baby cry it out (the Ferber method) doesn't work for your baby and it goes against your beliefs as a parent, don't do it. You might hear from a friend or family member that starting your baby on solid foods now will help him sleep through the night. But you need to wait at least one more month. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't recommend that babies eat anything but breast milk or formula until they are between 4 months and 6 months old."
412,What motor skills milestones should you expect in your 3-month-old?,"You've probably also noticed that baby's neck strength is improving. When you hold him upright, you should see very little or even no head wobbling. Three-month-old babies also should have enough upper-body strength to support their head and chest with their arms while lying on their stomach and enough lower body strength to stretch out their legs and kick. As you watch your baby, you should see some early signs of hand-eye coordination. Your baby's hands can open and shut, come together, swipe at colorful dangling toys, briefly grab a toy or rattle, and go straight into the mouth. Your baby's daytime sleep schedule should also become more routine by now."
412,What communication milestones should you expect in your 3-month-old?,"When you hold him upright, you should see very little or even no head wobbling. As you watch your baby, you should see some early signs of hand-eye coordination. At three months, your baby is becoming more of a unique human being. This is the stage that child psychiatrist Margaret Mahler referred to as ''hatching,'' when babies come out of their ''shells'' and begin to react and relate to the world around them. Part of this hatching process involves interacting with people and smiling for pleasure, otherwise known as social smiles. By the third month, crying is no longer your baby's primary method of communication. Eventually, he will start forming his own sounds and making his own gestures. If letting your baby cry it out (the Ferber method) doesn't work for your baby and it goes against your beliefs as a parent, don't do it."
413,What are the different types of thyroid cancer?,"There are four main types of thyroid cancer: Papillary (the most common type) Follicular Medullary Anaplastic If your doctor finds cancer, he'll begin the process of staging."
413,What are the stages of medullary thyroid cancer?,"The following things apply to everyone who has this type of cancer, no matter their age. Stage I -- The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. It's only in your thyroid. Stage II -- It's larger than 2 centimeters and found only in your thyroid. Or, it's any size but has spread to tissues beyond your thyroid. It hasn't spread to your lymph nodes. Stage III -- It may be smaller or larger than 2 centimeters and may also be in the tissues beyond your thyroid. The cancer is now in the lymph nodes near your voice box and windpipe. Stage IV -- As with follicular and papillary thyroid cancer, stage IV means that the cancer has spread to distant sites in your body, and the letters â A,â â B,â and â Câ indicate where it has gone."
413,"What are the stages of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, stage IV?","If you are at stage IV, it means the cancer has spread. Your doctor assigns the letters â A,â â Bâ and â Câ to show how far. Stage IVA -- The cancer has spread beyond your thyroid. It now is under your skin, or it affects your larynx, esophagus or trachea. A smaller tumor in more distant lymph nodes is also considered stage IVA. Stage IVB -- The tumor has grown toward your spine or into nearby large blood vessels, like the carotid arteries. These carry blood to your brain, face, and neck. It might have also spread to your lymph nodes. Stage IVC -- The cancer has spread beyond the thyroid, and to distant sites of the body. It may be in your lungs, bones, and lymph nodes."
413,What is the TNM staging system for thyroid cancer?,"The American Joint Committee on Cancer created the system that's most often used to describe the stages of thyroid cancer. It's called the â TNMâ system, and it focuses on these three things: T -- How big is the main tumor, and has it spread to other areas of the body? N -- Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? ( These are bean-shaped cells that help your body fight infection). M -- Has the cancer spread, or metastasized, to other areas of the body or organs, namely the lungs, liver, and bones?"
413,What are the main types of thyroid cancer?,"The thyroid is a gland at the base of your throat. It makes hormones that help your body work properly. There are four main types of thyroid cancer: Papillary (the most common type) Follicular Medullary Anaplastic If your doctor finds cancer, he'll begin the process of staging. He'll run tests to see if it has spread to other parts of your body."
413,What are the stages of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer in patients under age 45?,"Here's what each stage of thyroid cancer means, grouped by types: Stage I -- The tumor can be any size. It may have spread nearby tissues or nearby lymph nodes. But it hasn't spread to other parts of the body. Stage II -- The tumor is any size. Cancer may have spread to your lymph nodes. It also has spread to other parts of your body, like your lungs or bones."
413,What are the stages of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer in patients age 45 and older?,"The tumor is 2 centimeters (about the size of a nickel) or smaller. Stage II -- You only have cancer in your thyroid. The tumor is more than 2 centimeters but less than 4 centimeters. Stage III -- The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters and has spread to tissues near your thyroid, or it's smaller and has reached your nearby lymph nodes. Here's what each stage means: Stage IVA -- Cancer is in your thyroid."
414,What are usual symptoms of food allergies that will lead to asthma?,"Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and can be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods For most people, the usual symptoms of food allergies are hives, rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you have food allergies that trigger symptoms of an asthma attack, you will likely have these allergy symptoms, followed by coughing and wheezing. And if not caught quickly, anaphylaxis -- swelling of the throat, cutting off your airway -- may result."
414,How can keeping epinephrine help me deal with asthma?,"If your allergies are severe, you should keep two epinephrine shot kits with you that are always easy to get to. If you have any sign of anaphylaxis, don't hesitate to use the epinephrine auto-injector, even if you aren't sure your symptoms are allergy-related. Using the auto-injector as a precaution won't hurt you and might save you. Dial 911 after you give yourself the shot."
414,How can allergy shots help me deal with asthma?,"They can train your immune system to not overreact. The doctors will give you allergy shots (immunotherapy) -- a small amount of the substance that causes your allergy. After repeated shots over a period of time, your immune system eventually stops causing the allergic reaction. Ask your doctor if you're a candidate for allergy shots. Sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT) is an alternative to allergy shots."
414,What food preservatives can trigger asthma attack?,"Foods rarely trigger an asthma attack. Additives, such as sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, are commonly used in food processing or preparation and can be found in foods such as: Dried fruits or vegetables Potatoes (packaged and some prepared) Wine and beer Bottled lime or lemon juice Shrimp (fresh, frozen, or prepared) Pickled foods For most people, the usual symptoms of food allergies are hives, rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."
414,What foods most often cause allergic symptoms in people with asthma?,"But the symptoms of a severe allergic reaction to some foods can mimic asthma symptoms. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Tree nuts Food preservatives can also trigger an asthma attack. If you have food allergies that trigger symptoms of an asthma attack, you will likely have these allergy symptoms, followed by coughing and wheezing."
415,Can cancer therapy dogs sit on beds or other hospital equipment?,"The animals shouldn't come in contact with wounds or equipment, and they aren't allowed to visit patients who are eating or drinking."
415,How often do therapy dogs for cancer stay at the hospital?,"Most of these dogs live at home with their owners and make routine visits to cancer facilities. The visits usually last less than 2 hours, and the animals typically stay with each person for about 15 or 20 minutes. Dogs can go to rooms, treatment areas like chemotherapy suites, and lounges or group areas."
415,Can cancer therapy dogs give me diseases?,"The dogs are screened regularly by a vet and kept current on all their shots, including rabies. It's possible for a dog to pass on diseases to people or injure them. But such things rarely, if ever, happen with trained, registered therapy dogs."
415,How do I arrange a visit with a cancer therapy dog?,"Most service a local area, but some will bring a pup wherever you are. Some therapy dogs make regularly scheduled visits to facilities, say once or twice a week. If you're just not up for it when the dog comes, you can reschedule for next time. Check with your hospital liaison to get help setting one up."
415,What kind of dogs are therapy dogs for cancer?,"Therapy dogs come in all shapes, sizes, and breeds, including golden retrievers, poodles, dachshunds, pugs, and German shepherds. But certain canines match up better with specific people. For example, an active child may do better with an active dog who likes to play and can fetch a ball. If you're not feeling well or are in pain, a calm dog who can lie on the bed with you may be a better choice."
415,Can therapy dogs for cancer help with physical therapy?,"They can help with physical therapy, too. When you pet a dog, that can help improve your sensory and fine motor skills. A canine may even help you with the all-important first step: getting out of bed. Walking with a dog on a leash and playing games with it can help your balance and coordination."
415,Are cancer therapy dogs clean?,Anyone who comes in contact with the dog should wash their hands before and afterward. The dogs are usually bathed the day before a therapy session and brushed right before seeing patients. The therapy vest many of the animals wear helps catch loose hair.
416,What is systolic and diastolic blood pressure?,"For example, a blood pressure reading is written as 120/80 mm Hg, or ""120 over 80"". The systolic pressure is 120 and the diastolic pressure is 80."
416,What lifestyle changes can help treat high blood pressure?,"Lifestyle changes for high blood pressure include: Losing weight Quitting smoking Eating a healthy diet, such as the DASH diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains and low in salt and fat Reducing the amount of salt in your diet Regular aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking) Limiting alcohol consumption Seeking treatment for sleep apnea Commonly prescribed high blood pressure drugs include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers (alpha-adrenergic antagonists)."

417,What helps someone rehydrate if they have traveler's diarrhea?,"Avoid caffeinated, sugary, and alcoholic drinks, which can worsen diarrhea. If you have diarrhea more than 4 times a day, or are more at risk of dehydration (kids and seniors), use premixed oral rehydration solutions available at drug stores. They provide a balance of water and electrolytes (potassium and sodium) lost in your stools. If you do not feel like eating solid foods at first, you may start the BRAT diet -- bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast -- or salted soda crackers, boiled potatoes, and cereals after 24 hours. Avoiding dairy products for the first 24 hours may help."
417,When should you see a healthcare provider about traveler's diarrhea?,"If diarrhea is bloody, or if you have a fever or abdominal pain, see a healthcare provider immediately. Take a child to a doctor if symptoms include bloody diarrhea, dehydration, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit."
418,What are the causes of testicular azoospermia?,"Testicular azoospermia: Damage to your testicles keeps them from making sperm normally. It can happen because of: An infection in your reproductive tract, such as epididymitis and urethritis A childhood illness such as viral orchitis, which causes swelling of one or both testicles A groin injury Cancer or its treatments, like radiation Genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter's syndrome Post-testicular azoospermia: Your testicles make normal sperm, but something keeps them from getting out, like: A blockage in the tubes that carry sperm from your testicles to your penis."
418,What are the treatments for azoospermia?,"There are a few types of treatment that can help men with azoospermia who want to have children. If you have the obstructive type, surgery can remove the blockage. One way to do this is to use a tiny needle to draw sperm from a testicle. Then, you can freeze the sample to use later in in vitro fertilization ( IVF)."
419,Is hay fever different from allergic rhinitis?,"You probably call it hay fever, but your doctor might refer to it as allergic rhinitis. It's most likely to strike when pollen ramps up in the spring and summer."
420,How can I deal with the emotional effects of rheumatoid arthritis?,"If your pain starts to make you feel bad a lot of the time -- you're depressed, angry, or anxious often -- tell your doctor, or talk with a professional counselor. It may help to do cognitive behavioral training, where you learn new, positive ways to handle pain and other problems."
420,Should I tell my doctor how I feel if I have rheumatoid arthritis?,"Tell your doctor how you feel. He may want to change your medications or their doses. It's important for you let him know what's going on. Don't say â I'm fine,â or, â It's OKâ if it's really not."
420,Should I take a breathing break if I have rheumatoid arthritis?,"Quietly tune in to your breaths. Breathe in and out normally. Just notice each one. If other thoughts come up (and they will), let them go and turn your attention back to your breath. It's a simple way to tune in and calm down. Even a few minutes a day can help."
421,What are the drawbacks of rheumatoid factor used to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis?,"Drawbacks: It misses 20% to 30% of cases of RA. It also shows up in other conditions, including: Chronic hepatitis Chronic viral infection Dermatomyositis Infectious mononucleosis Leukemia Scleroderma Sjogren's syndrome Lupus It's uncommon, but some healthy people can have RF in their blood test results. People with lupus often have high levels of these immune system chemicals."
421,What are the drawbacks for an anti-CCP antibody test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,Drawbacks: It misses 10% to 15% of cases of RA.
421,How does an erythrocyte sedimentation rate help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,This test gauges how much inflammation is in the body. It's usually higher than normal in people with RA and other inflammatory diseases. Doctors may use this test to see whether treatment has lowered inflammation.

423,How is the cause of pancreatitis in dogs found?,"If your vet can figure out what caused the pancreatitis, he'll try to deal with that first. For instance, if it was a reaction to a drug, he may take him off it. If it's related to diet, he may put him on prescription food. Sometimes it's hard to tell what causes it, and there's no clear treatment to fight it. The focus instead becomes keeping the dog as comfortable as possible until the attack passes."
423,What should you know about pancreatitis in dogs?,"If so, he'll need treatment. The condition happens when the pancreas becomes inflamed. That's an organ near the stomach that helps digest food and control blood sugar. Pancreatitis can come on all at once and then pass, or it can stay for longer periods. It could be pancreatitis, or it could be something else. Your dog doesn't need to eat human food."
423,What is the treatment for pancreatitis in dogs?,"For the first 24 hours, your vet may recommend no food or water, or may continue to give your pet food. Pain medications are usually given by injection. These things give the pancreas a rest. Giving your dog IV fluids is also a common practice for pancreatitis. When he gets home, you'll need to give him lots of water to make sure he doesn't get dehydrated. He may need medication for pain, too. He may also get drugs to help ease nausea and vomiting. When your dog starts eating again, make sure it's a low-fat diet. Look for food that's easy to digest. If this is a single, sudden attack, it's a good idea to stick with this diet for a week or so. However, if your dog has experienced several episodes, then this new way of eating will be for life. Your dog doesn't need to eat human food."

424,What other foods are high in fiber?,"Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The fiber found in citrus fruits and legumes stimulate the growth of colonic flora, which increases the stool weight and the amount of bacteria in the stool. Encouraging the growth of certain bacteria in the colon may help promote a healthy intestine."
424,When should you use a psyllium powder?,"Soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food. But if you can't eat enough fruits and vegetables to make a difference, then opt for fiber supplements. Examples include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. With psyllium powder, mix the powder in a glass of water one to three times daily. Be sure to drink enough water along with this psyllium powder drink. The drink may cause you to feel bloated until you get used to the fiber."

This is not a broken bone, but can feel like one since it's often impossible to put weight on the joint or use the affected limb because the joint isn't stable."
442,How long does it take to recover from a sprain or strain?,"The time frame for recovery depends on the severity of the injury and can vary from person to person. It may take just a few days for a slight sprain of an ankle to heal, or it may take months for a knee that needs surgery to reconstruct it. For most mild to moderate sprains and strains, you can expect to regain full mobility within 3 to 8 weeks. More severe injuries can take months for a full recovery."
442,Who's most likely to get strains?,"Athletes in contact sports, like football, hockey, and boxing, have the biggest chance of strains. Even in noncontact sports like tennis, golf, or rowing, doing the same motions over and over can lead to strains of the hand and forearm."
442,What causes sprains?,"Sprains usually happen when a person falls, twists, or is hit in a way that forces the body out of its normal position. Wrist and thumb sprains are also common, particularly in sports like skiing, where it's not unusual to fall and land on an outstretched palm. Even in noncontact sports like tennis, golf, or rowing, doing the same motions over and over can lead to strains of the hand and forearm."
442,What's the difference between a sprain and a strain?,"People use the words âsprainâ and âstrainâ almost interchangeably, to describe everything from a twisted ankle to a pulled hamstring. But they're not the same. A strain is also a stretch or tear, but it happens in a muscle or a tendon. Tendons link muscles to the bones."
443,"What can help someone who ""freezes"" in place because of Parkinson's disease?","If you have trouble with ""freezing"" in place: Rock from foot to foot to get moving again. Have someone place their foot in front of you, or visualize something you need to step over, to get moving again."
443,What can help with the stress of having Parkinson's disease?,The most important step you can take is to seek help as soon as you feel less able to cope with Parkinson's disease. Taking action early will enable you to understand and deal with the many effects of your condition. A mental health care provider can design a treatment plan to meet your specific needs. Strategies can be designed to help you regain a sense of control over your life and improve your quality of life.
443,Who can get deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's disease?,"One of the most important criteria is that you try drug treatment first. Surgery is not recommended if medications can adequately control the disease. However, surgery should be considered if you do not achieve satisfactory control with medications. Strategies can be designed to help you regain a sense of control over your life and improve your quality of life."
444,Will drinking water and other fluids cure constipation?,"Extra fluids help keep the stool soft and easy to pass, but drinking more liquids does not cure constipation."
444,How much fluid is enough to ease chronic constipation?,"When it comes to thirst, most experts say you should let your body be your guide. The Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board suggests that women get 91 ounces of water each day from foods and drinks and men should get 125 ounces. Remember, this recommendation includes the fluids that you take in from your food. In general, for healthy, average people, 8 cups a day is a good goal. Talk to your doctor about how much water is good for you. People with some medical conditions may need to drink less than that. Others may need more than 8 cups a day."
444,What causes chronic constipation?,"If you don't have enough water in your body already, the large intestine soaks up water from your food waste. This makes you have hard stools that are difficult to pass. There are other causes of chronic constipation too, including what you eat, traveling, medicines, irritable bowel syndrome, and pregnancy."
444,Are there fluids you should avoid if you have constipation?,"It is a diuretic, which gets rid of water from your body and leads to dehydration. Caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and colas are also diuretics, but as long as you drink moderate amounts, they probably won't cause dehydration."
444,How can you prevent dehydration?,"Watch the amount of fluid you drink, listen to your body, and drink more liquids during exercise and hot weather. You get dehydrated when your body gets rid of more fluids -- usually through sweating or going to the bathroom more than normal -- than it takes in. Drinking too little water during exercise, hot weather, or daily activities can also cause your body to use up its stored water."
444,"Besides water, what other fluids are hydrating for constipation?","Fruit and vegetable juices, clear soups, and herbal teas are also good sources of fluids."
444,How can water affect your digestion?,"It keeps the food you eat moving through your intestines, and it keeps your intestines smooth and flexible, too. Talk to your doctor about how much water is good for you."
444,How can you treat chronic constipation?,"If you're looking for a simple way to ease chronic constipation, drink plenty of fluids every day. Staying well-hydrated can be a key part of your plan to ""get things moving"" again. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of chronic constipation."
445,What are some common thoughts that people diagnosed with hepatitis C have?,"If you've just been diagnosed with hepatitis C, you may wonder how you got it and worry about passing on the virus to a loved one. If you've had the disease for a long time without knowing it, you could dwell on every little incident in the past where you might have accidentally exposed a family member to the disease."
445,How common is it for someone to catch hepatitis C through everyday contact?,It cannot be spread through: Coughing Sneezing Hugging Kissing Breastfeeding (unless nipples are cracked or bleeding) Sharing utensils or glasses Casual contact Sharing food and water Mosquito or other insect bites That means everyday contact isn't risky. The odds of it spreading between people in a household are near zero.
445,What should someone with hepatitis C do to encourage others to get tested?,"While the odds of passing on the hepatitis C virus are low, you should still tell anyone at risk that you have hepatitis C. You should tell sexual partners, spouses, and family members. Your infection may be difficult to discuss, but anyone at potential risk must know."
445,What are some precautions someone with hepatitis C can take?,"Get into a treatment program if you can. At the very least, don't share needles or equipment with anyone else. This includes razors, toothbrushes, nail clippers, or anything else that could have your blood on it. Cover any open wounds or sores with bandages. Carefully dispose of tampons, sanitary napkins, tissues, used bandages, and anything else that might have your blood on it. Hepatitis C can spread through sexual intercourse, but it's rare. You can't give blood if you currently have symptoms or have ever tested positive for hepatitis C. But you can probably donate organs or tissue, since risk of transmission is low and hepatitis C is curable."
445,How common is hepatitis C spread through sexual activity?,"Hepatitis C can spread through sexual intercourse, but it's rare. In fact, the CDC considers the risk of sexual transmission between monogamous couples so low that it doesn't even recommend using condoms. Also, there's no evidence that hepatitis C is spread by oral sex. If you have HIV or if you have multiple partners, you should take precautions. Using condoms will protect you and your partners."
445,How common is it for a family member to catch hepatitis C?,"If you've just been diagnosed with hepatitis C, you may wonder how you got it and worry about passing on the virus to a loved one. It's important to remember that hepatitis C isn't easy to catch. If you take a few precautions, it's almost impossible to pass on the disease to someone else. The odds of it spreading between people in a household are near zero."
446,What are decongestant sprays?,"Decongestant sprays shrink swollen blood vessels and tissues in your nose that cause congestion. Oxymetazoline hydrochloride ( Afrin, Dristan, Sinex) and phenylephrine hydrochloride ( Neo- Synephrine) are some examples of these medicines. You can buy them over the counter. Don't use decongestant nasal sprays longer than three days. Using them longer can actually make your nose more stopped up. Ask your doctor before using them if you have glaucoma or high blood pressure that's not under control."
446,Is cromolyn safe to use for allergies?,Cromolyn sodium is safe for most people. Ask your doctor before using it if you have wheezing from asthma or sinus pain. Side effects can include sneezing and nasal burning.
446,What are examples of steroid nasal sprays?,"Examples of steroid nasal sprays available by prescription include beclomethasone ( Beconase, Qnasl), ciclesonide ( Zetonna), fluticasone furoate ( Veramyst), and mometasone ( Nasonex). Three medications can be purchased over the counter -- budesonide ( Rhinocort Allergy), fluticasone ( Flonase Allergy Relief), and triamcinolone ( Nasacort Allergy 24 HR). Side effects can include headache, sore throat, nosebleed, or cough."
446,What are steroid nasal sprays?,"These sprays work very well to reduce congestion, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. They also help stop a drippy nose. They're often the first drug recommended for allergies, but it takes about a week before you'll notice your symptoms getting better."
446,Can nasal sprays help allergies?,"You can buy them at the drugstore, or your doctor can prescribe one to relieve a stuffy or runny nose. It can also help a stuffy nose."
447,When should you call your doctor about eczema?,"You develop an itchy rash and have a family history of eczema or asthma. The inflammation doesn't respond within a week to treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams. You may need more aggressive forms of treatment. You develop yellowish to light brown crust or pus-filled blisters over existing patches of eczema. This may indicate a bacterial infection that should be treated with an antibiotic. During a flare-up of eczema, you are exposed to anyone with a viral skin disease such as cold sores or genital herpes. Having eczema puts you at increased risk of contracting the herpes simplex virus. You develop numerous painful, small, fluid-filled blisters in the areas of eczema. You may have eczema herpeticum, a rare but potentially serious complication caused by the herpes simplex virus."
448,How do insulin pumps deliver insulin?,"Between meals and overnights, a small amount of insulin is constantly delivered to keep the blood sugar in the target range. This is called the basal rate. When food is eaten, a bolus dose of insulin can be programmed into the pump. You can measure how much of a bolus you need using calculations based on the grams of carbohydrates consumed."
448,Why should I use an insulin pump for diabetes?,Some health care providers prefer the insulin pump for diabetes because its slow release of insulin mimics how a normally working pancreas would release insulin. One large study concluded the insulin pump is a safe and valuable treatment option for those with poorly controlled blood sugar. Another advantage of the insulin pump is that it frees you from having to measure insulin into a syringe.
449,What are rare symptoms of malignant hypertension due to brain swelling?,"Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include: Blurred vision Chest pain (angina) Difficulty breathing Dizziness Numbness in the arms, legs, and face Severe headache Shortness of breath In rare cases, malignant hypertension can cause brain swelling, which leads to a dangerous condition called hypertensive encephalopathy. Symptoms include: Blindness Changes in mental status Coma Confusion Drowsiness Headache that continues to get worse Nausea and vomiting Seizures High blood pressure, in general, makes it difficult for kidneys to filter wastes and toxins from the blood."
449,What are complications of malignant hypertension?,"Untreated, malignant hypertension causes death. Complications of malignant hypertension also may include: Aortic dissection, which is a sudden rupture of the main blood vessel leaving the heart Coma Fluid in the lungs, called pulmonary edema Heart attack Heart failure Stroke Sudden kidney failure Immediate medical treatment decreases your chances for life-threatening complications."
449,What are the main symptoms for malignant hypertension?,"The main symptoms of malignant hypertension are a rapidly increasing blood pressure of 180/120 or higher and signs of organ damage. Usually, the damage happens to the kidneys or the eyes. Other symptoms depend on how the rise in blood pressure affects your organs. A common symptom is bleeding and swelling in the tiny blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the layer of nerves that line the back of the eye. It senses light and sends signals to the brain through the optic nerve, which can also be affected by malignant hypertension. When the eye is involved, malignant hypertension can cause changes in vision."
449,What are other symptoms of malignant hypertension?,"Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include: Blurred vision Chest pain (angina) Difficulty breathing Dizziness Numbness in the arms, legs, and face Severe headache Shortness of breath In rare cases, malignant hypertension can cause brain swelling, which leads to a dangerous condition called hypertensive encephalopathy."
449,How is malignant hypertension treated?,"The doctor will also ask for imaging tests, including: Echocardiogram to check heart function and blood flow through the heart Electrocardiogram ( ECG) to check the heart's electrical function Chest X-ray to look at the shape and size of the heart structures and to detect fluid in the lungs Other imaging tests to evaluate the kidneys and their arteries Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital, often in an intensive care unit. The doctor will consider your symptoms and overall health when deciding what treatment plan is best for you. The goal of treatment is to carefully lower your blood pressure within a matter of minutes. You will receive blood pressure medicines through an IV, which is the quickest way to treat extremely high blood pressure. Once blood pressure is at a safe level, the medications may be switched to oral forms. If you develop kidney failure, you may need kidney dialysis. Other treatments depend on your specific symptoms and possible causes of the malignant hypertension."
449,Why can malignant hypertension cause kidney problems?,"Symptoms include: Blindness Changes in mental status Coma Confusion Drowsiness Headache that continues to get worse Nausea and vomiting Seizures High blood pressure, in general, makes it difficult for kidneys to filter wastes and toxins from the blood. It is a leading cause of kidney failure. Malignant hypertension can cause your kidneys to suddenly stop working properly."
449,What imaging tests will a doctor use to check for malignant hypertension?,"The doctor will also ask for imaging tests, including: Echocardiogram to check heart function and blood flow through the heart Electrocardiogram ( ECG) to check the heart's electrical function Chest X-ray to look at the shape and size of the heart structures and to detect fluid in the lungs Other imaging tests to evaluate the kidneys and their arteries Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital, often in an intensive care unit."
449,What causes malignant hypertension?,"In many people, high blood pressure is the main cause of malignant hypertension. Missing doses of blood pressure medications can also cause it. In addition, there are certain medical conditions that can cause it. They include: Collagen vascular disease, such as scleroderma Kidney disease Spinal cord injuries Tumor of the adrenal gland Use of certain medications, including birth control pills and MAOIs Use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine Malignant hypertension is rare."
449,Who's at risk for malignant hypertension?,"About 1% of people who have a history of high blood pressure develop this life-threatening condition. You are at greater risk of developing it if you are a man, African- American, or someone of lower economic status. Poor access to health care increases the risk. Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include: Blurred vision Chest pain (angina) Difficulty breathing Dizziness Numbness in the arms, legs, and face Severe headache Shortness of breath In rare cases, malignant hypertension can cause brain swelling, which leads to a dangerous condition called hypertensive encephalopathy."
449,What is malignant hypertension?,A person with malignant hypertension has a blood pressure that's typically above 180/120. Malignant hypertension should be treated as a medical emergency. The main symptoms of malignant hypertension are a rapidly increasing blood pressure of 180/120 or higher and signs of organ damage.
450,When should someone with schizophrenia call 911?,"If you're afraid help from your doctor isn't going to be fast enough, you may need call to 911. To decide when you should call for help, ask yourself these questions: Is your loved one threatening to harm himself or someone else, including you? Has he ever attempted suicide before? Is he unable to feed or dress himself? Is he living on the streets? If you answered âyesâ to any of these, call 911 or a local emergency number. Don't try to solve the situation on your own or put yourself at risk. If you think there's any chance that he will try to commit suicide, ask someone to stay with him while you call for emergency help."
450,When should someone with schizophrenia call their doctor?,"You'll probably notice signs leading up to a psychotic episode. Symptoms vary, but there are some common ones, including: Mistrustful or suspicious beliefs or ideas Unexpected outbursts Isolation from friends and family Noticeable mood changes Trouble sleeping Bizarre behavior Call your doctor for advice if your loved one's mood changes or his thinking seems unusual. If he's stopped taking his medication, but doesn't seem like he's going to hurt you or anyone else, encourage him to visit the doctor with you."
451,Is surgery an option for strabismus?,"It works best when done during childhood, but adults can have it, too The surgeon opens the eyeball's outer layer to reach a muscle. To strengthen the muscle, the surgeon removes a small section from one end and reattaches at the same location. This makes the muscle shorter, which turns the eye toward that side. To weaken a muscle, the doctor moves it back or makes a partial cut across it. The eye turns away from that side. Any double vision after surgery should go away within a few weeks as the brain adjusts to improved sight."
451,How is strabismus in children treated?,"He may start treatment with eyeglasses or a patch to force your child to use the off-kilter eye until he sees normally. Sometimes, farsightedness is to blame. Glasses may solve the problem. The main goal is to get the problem eye working like it should before your child turns 8 years old. After that, permanent vision loss can set in."
451,What causes strabismus?,"There may be a problem with the part of his nervous system that controls eye muscles. Or he could have a tumor or eye disorder. If it doesn't appear until later in life, it will cause double vision. If an adult's eyes cross without warning, he could have a serious condition like a stroke. If either one happens, see a doctor immediately. However, that may lead to ""lazy eye,"" a condition your doctor will refer to as amblyopia. Most adults with crossed eyes were born that way."
452,How does allogeneic stem cell transplant help in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"Allogeneic stem cell transplant. It's the only potential cure. The procedure is usually done if you're young and don't have any medical issues besides CML. It replaces abnormal white blood cells with stem cells you get from a donor and lets your body make healthy blood cells. But there are serious risks, including a disease called GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). When this happens, the new stem cells attack your normal cells by mistake."
452,Does chemotherapy help in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"It kills the abnormal cells in your body, but it doesn't work as well for CML as other types of leukemia. It's usually used if you're in the ""blast"" phase of the disease, a period when infections and bleeding are common and can be life-threatening."
452,How do you know if your treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia is working?,"For instance, he'll look to see that you have: Normal blood cell counts with no signs of abnormal white blood cells, called a complete hematologic response. No blood or bone marrow cells that contain the "" Philadelphia"" chromosome, which creates the BCR- ABL gene. This is called a complete cytogenetic response. No sign of BCR- ABL in your blood, also called a complete molecular response."
452,How does immunotherapy help in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"It helps your immune system, your body's defense against germs, destroy the cancer."
452,What are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia?,Your doctor will likely prescribe a TKI such as: Bosutinib ( Bosulif) Dasatinib ( Sprycel) Imatinib ( Gleevec) Nilotinib ( Tasigna) Ponatinib ( Iclusig) Most people get a quick response from these drugs.
452,What is the first step in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"Your doctor will decide on a treatment plan based on the stage of your disease. He'll likely start you off with a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI). It blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase, which is made by the BCR- ABL gene and plays a role in the growth of abnormal blood cells."
452,What is a typical schedule for testing in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"While you take TKIs, you'll get regular blood tests, including: Complete blood counts to check white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets Blood cell exams to check the percentage of abnormal blood cells Cytogenetic analysis, which looks for the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) tests to check for the BCR- ABL gene A typical schedule for testing may look something like this: During the first 3 months, you'll likely have a complete round of blood tests every 2 weeks. At 3 months, you may get a follow-up bone marrow study. After the third month, you'll have blood and bone marrow tests at least once every 6 months until you have a complete cytogenetic response. Once you have a complete cytogenetic and molecular response, you'll get a PCR test every 3-6 months and a cytogenetic analysis once every year."
452,What are side effects from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that treat chronic myelogenous leukemia?,Some side effects that you might have from a TKI are: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Rash Headache Fatigue Lower blood cell counts Your doctor will set several goals to help him check if your treatment is doing its job.
452,How effective is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"Your doctor will likely prescribe a TKI such as: Bosutinib ( Bosulif) Dasatinib ( Sprycel) Imatinib ( Gleevec) Nilotinib ( Tasigna) Ponatinib ( Iclusig) Most people get a quick response from these drugs. Your doctor will likely know in 3 to 6 months if your treatment works. You may go into ""remission"" while you take a TKI. That means that the abnormal gene is no longer in your cells. It doesn't mean that you're cured, but your CML is now under control."
452,What blood tests will you get if you take  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"While you take TKIs, you'll get regular blood tests, including: Complete blood counts to check white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets Blood cell exams to check the percentage of abnormal blood cells Cytogenetic analysis, which looks for the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) tests to check for the BCR- ABL gene A typical schedule for testing may look something like this: During the first 3 months, you'll likely have a complete round of blood tests every 2 weeks."
452,What kind of doctor treats chronic myelogenous leukemia?,"To find the best one for you, you'll work closely with a specialist called a hematologist-oncologist, a doctor with special training in blood diseases such as leukemia. The goal is to destroy cells that contain the BCR- ABL gene, which leads to too many abnormal white blood cells. It doesn't mean that you're cured, but your CML is now under control."
453,How is obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosed?,"You are more likely to get the disorder if you have: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Depression, anxiety or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Your doctor may do a physical exam and bloodwork to make sure that your symptoms aren't caused by something else. She will also talk with you about your feelings, thoughts, and habits. If your thoughts and habits keep you from doing what you want to do for at least an hour a day, you may have OCD."
453,What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"Some have both obsessions and compulsions. Certain areas in the brain may not look normal in people with OCD, but more research is needed. There may be a gene or genes linked to OCD, but this is still unknown. You are more likely to get the disorder if you have: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Depression, anxiety or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Your doctor may do a physical exam and bloodwork to make sure that your symptoms aren't caused by something else."
454,What should I expect on the 3rd day after my hip replacement surgery?,"3 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery Walking will likely be easier. You may be able to walk to the bathroom without help. You will be discharged from the hospital if you are doing well. Some people stay longer if they have complications. Depending on your situation, you may go straight home or to a rehab facility, where you'll recover."
454,What should you expect during your hip replacement surgery?,"Day of Your Hip Replacement Surgery You'll check in several hours before your scheduled surgery. Expect to stay for 3 to 4 days. The procedure will probably last about 2 to 3 hours. Recovery from anesthesia will probably take about 2 hours. Once you're fully awake, you'll go to your hospital room. You will likely stick to a liquid diet for the rest of the day. You will need medication to help with pain and to prevent infection and blood clots."
455,What does a fibroadenoma feel like?,"Usually, a fibroadenoma won't cause any pain. It will feel like a marble that moves around beneath your skin. You may describe the texture as firm, smooth, or rubbery. In some cases, though, you won't even be able to feel it at all."
455,How is a fibroadenoma treated if it gets larger?,"If your fibroadenoma gets larger, the doctor suspects that it might, or he isn't sure whether a lump is a fibroadenoma or not, he'll likely recommend removing any lumps. This will help confirm that a lump isn't cancer and that it doesn't grow and distort the surrounding breast tissue."
455,What does follow-up care for fibroadenoma entail?,"Most women won't need anything beyond routine screening tests. They'll continue to get any breast changes checked out by a doctor. Having a simple fibroadenoma may raise your risk of breast cancer, compared with women without fibroadenomas. But if yours was complex, it might mean a slightly higher risk of breast cancer later on. Unless you have other things that make breast cancer more likely, like close family members with the disease, your odds are still low. Either way, keep up with your regular checkups, and ask your doctor which screening tests you need and when."
455,Who gets fibroadenomas?,"Fibroadenomas are very common. About 10% of women have one of these breast lumps, often without ever knowing. They most often appear in women between the ages of 15 and 35, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Some researchers have found that women with a family history of breast cancer are more likely to get fibroadenomas. Most women only have one."
455,How are fibroadenomas treated if they have been removed in the past?,"If you've had more than one fibroadenoma removed in the past, and tests confirmed that that's what they were, your doctor also may delay removing any new lumps."
455,How is a fibroadenoma diagnosed?,"If your doctor has told you that you have a fibroadenoma in your breast, don't panic. You can't tell for sure what it is by how it feels. Your doctor will likely feel the lump so he can gauge its texture and size. Even if he thinks it might be a fibroadenoma, he'll recommend that you get more tests to confirm it. You may get an ultrasound or a mammogram, depending on your age and whether you're pregnant. Both are quick scans that you'll get in the doctor's office. A radiologist will then check the images of your breast tissue to see if it's a fibroadenoma or something else. The only way for a doctor to get know for sure that it's a fibroadenoma is through a biopsy, which means taking a sample of the lump to test in a lab. Based on the results of your examination and scan, your doctor will decide whether he needs to get extra confirmation from a biopsy. To do a biopsy, a doctor will insert a thin needle into your breast and pull out a small sample from the lump."
455,What does a fibroadenoma look like?,"Unlike a breast cancer, which grows larger over time and can spread to other organs, a fibroadenoma remains in the breast tissue. They're pretty small, too. Most are only 1 or 2 centimeters in size. It's very rare for them to get larger than 5 centimeters across. If your fibroadenoma gets larger, the doctor suspects that it might, or he isn't sure whether a lump is a fibroadenoma or not, he'll likely recommend removing any lumps."
455,What is the treatment for fibroadenoma?,"It's not cancer. If your fibroadenoma gets larger, the doctor suspects that it might, or he isn't sure whether a lump is a fibroadenoma or not, he'll likely recommend removing any lumps."
456,What's the definition of blood pressure?,Blood pressure is the force of the blood against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps it around your body.
457,How can you manage sound sensitivity caused by migraine?,"To manage sound sensitivity: Avoid concerts, movies, big parties, or other places you know will be loud. Wear noise-canceling headphones or earplugs. Cover your windows with heavy drapes (which will block light, too), and install thick carpet to absorb sounds in your home. Turn on a white noise machine. This gentle sound can drown out louder noises. You might not want to avoid sound entirely. If you surround yourself with silence, you can become even more sensitive, and that could lead to headaches that are more painful."
457,What are the types of migraine drugs?,"Knowing about these symptoms can help her choose the right way to help you with them. Migraine drugs come in two forms: Preventive agents that are taken on a daily basis to reduce attack frequency. These include antidepressants, beta-blockers, and anti-seizure drugs can sometimes help stop headaches before they start. You might need to take these every day. Acute therapies, like triptans and ergots, can help with the pain once you have a headache. They also can help with sound and light sensitivity. They work best if you take them as soon as possible after your headache starts. You can make a few small changes at home and at work to manage your light and sound triggers."
458,What high blood pressure drugs are commonly linked to erectile dysfunction?,High blood pressure by itself can lead to erectile dysfunction.
458,How can beta-blockers cause erectile dysfunction?,"Beta-blockers dampen the response to nerve impulses that lead to an erection. They also make it more difficult for the arteries in the penis to widen and let in blood. What's more, they can make you feel sedated and depressed -- and the mind always plays some part in sexual arousal."
458,Can diuretics cause erectile dysfunction?,High blood pressure by itself can lead to erectile dysfunction. Your body needs zinc to make testosterone.
458,Can high blood pressure lead to erectile dysfunction?,"That traps blood in the penis. As more blood flows in, the penis expands and stiffens, and you have an erection. They also make it more difficult for the arteries in the penis to widen and let in blood."
459,How does CPAP help treat central sleep apnea?,"With CPAP, patients wear a mask over their nose and/or mouth. An air blower forces air through the nose and/or mouth. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing during sleep. The pressure is constant and continuous. CPAP prevents airway closure while it is being used, but apnea episodes return when CPAP is stopped or is used improperly."
459,How is central sleep apnea treated?,"Some of these conservative treatments include: Losing weight if necessary, and then maintaining a healthy weight Avoiding the use of alcohol and sleeping pills, as these items make the airway more likely to collapse during sleep Sleeping on your side if you have apneic events when sleeping on your back, possibly using pillows or other devices to keep you in place Using nasal sprays or breathing strips to keep air flowing if you have sinus problems or nasal congestion Avoiding sleep deprivation Another treatment is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP), which is the preferred initial treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnea."
459,What are the symptoms of central sleep apnea?,"Conditions that may be associated with central sleep apnea include the following: Congestive heart failure Hypothyroid Disease Kidney failure Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) Damage to the brainstem caused by encephalitis, stroke, injury, or other factors The main symptom of CSA is temporary stoppages of breathing while asleep. Although snoring is a very strong symptom of obstructive sleep apnea, snoring is usually not found with central sleep apnea.

459,What is central sleep apnea?,"In CSA, breathing is disrupted regularly during sleep because of the way the brain functions. It is not that you cannot breathe (which is true in obstructive sleep apnea); rather, you do not try to breathe at all. The brain does not tell your muscles to breathe. This type of sleep apnea is usually associated with serious illness, especially an illness in which the lower brainstem -- which controls breathing -- is affected. In infants, central sleep apnea produces pauses in breathing that can last 20 seconds."

459,How is central sleep apnea diagnosed?,"If your doctor suspects you have central sleep apnea, he is likely to perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and recommend a sleep history. The next step will likely be an overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. This test is performed in a sleep lab under the direct supervision of a trained technologist. During the test, the following body functions may be monitored: Electrical activity of the brain Eye movements Muscle activity Heart rate Breathing patterns Air flow Blood oxygen levels After the study is completed, the technologist will tally the number of times that breathing is impaired during sleep and then grade the severity of sleep apnea."
459,What are the effects of sleep apnea?,"Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems. It can increase the risk for stroke, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure. It may also increase the risk for accidents while working or driving, as some people with sleep apnea may fall asleep during those activities."

475,What should I be monitoring while my child is on ADHD medication titration?,What works at first may not continue to over time. Watch your child for symptoms and side effects as he grows and his schedule and lifestyle change. Check in with the doctor every 3 months or so to make sure your child is still on the right treatment.
475,What side effects are associated with ADHD medication titration?,"Common side effects include sleeping problems, appetite loss, and not feeling as social. These often go away after a few weeks, so your doctor may encourage you to wait it out and see if they get better on their own.

A sudden onset of severe symptoms is sometimes called a â Hollywood heart attack,â because of the typical way heart attacks have been portrayed in movies and television. A heart attack can happen this way, but it doesn't that often."
476,What is pain like as a symptom of a heart attack in men?,"Pain or discomfort sometimes shows up in other areas because they're not getting enough blood.

477,How long are patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) hospitalized?,The goal is to get the inflammation down quickly and stop the immune system attack. This will likely take a week or two in the hospital.
477,What are the best therapies for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"After the hospital, they may need some combination of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They may have to stay in a rehab hospital for a while, or maybe they can go home and work with a therapist."
477,What causes acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,Other symptoms include: Fever Headache Sleepiness Behavior changes such as fussiness or confusion Nausea and vomiting Seizures Coma ADEM seems to be an autoimmune disease. That means your immune system attacks your body's own cells and tissues as if they were outside bacteria or viruses.
477,What triggers acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"Experts don't know exactly what triggers it, but it could be an overreaction to an infection. Most of the time, the attack happens when a child is getting over some common illness, like a cold or stomach bug. ADEM sometimes follows an immunization, particularly certain rabies shots and the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. No direct connection has been made though. Other times, nothing out of the ordinary happens before symptoms appear."
477,What is the treatment for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children?,"Most people start with high doses of a powerful corticosteroid by IV for a few days. Your child may feel better within hours. They'll continue to take a steroid (as a pill or a liquid) for several weeks, in smaller and smaller doses. If your child can't have steroids or if they don't work, some procedures can calm the immune system. The doctor may filter their blood through a machine to remove the antibodies that their immune system is sending to attack the brain. This is called plasmapheresis. Or they could get shots of antibodies from a healthy person, which is called intravenous immunoglobulin treatment."
477,What is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"ADEM is a rare kind of inflammation that affects the brain and spinal cord. It damages the protective coating of nerve fibers, called myelin. Most often, children under age 10 will get it. While symptoms can be severe, they can be treated. Most people make a full recovery and don't have another attack."
477,How is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) diagnosed in kids?,"But MS is rare in children. Other differences can also help your doctor make the right diagnosis. Kids with ADEM may have a fever, a headache, seizures, or trouble thinking clearly. The disease usually appears soon after a viral illness. There's no such link with MS. An ADEM attack usually happens once, while multiple sclerosis involves many episodes over time. Tests of spinal fluid usually show certain proteins when you have MS, but not ADEM. With ADEM, spinal fluid usually has more white blood cells than normal. Damage to the brain from ADEM and damage caused by multiple sclerosis look different on an MRI. It's more widespread with ADEM. The doctor has to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms, too, like infections of the brain and spinal cord such as meningitis."
477,What is the outlook for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)?,"Most of the time, a child who gets ADEM will recover completely. It will be a slow process, over 4 to 6 weeks. But it could be 6 months or up to a year before they're fully well. In some cases, kids don't get over all of their symptoms. They may have lasting vision damage or muscle weakness. They might have trouble in school if they've missed a lot of time, or perhaps as a lingering effect of the attack. About 8 times out of 10, ADEM happens only once. But sometimes you can get it again within a few months, especially if you don't take steroids for long enough. Your child might get MS later, but it's unlikely. In very rare cases, ADEM can be fatal."
477,Does therapy for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) usually continue after hospitalization?,"After the hospital, they may need some combination of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They may have to stay in a rehab hospital for a while, or maybe they can go home and work with a therapist. Your child's doctor will probably want a follow-up MRI to make sure the inflammation is gone and no new scars have formed."
477,How is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) differentiated from other conditions with similar symptoms?,"The condition has a lot in common with multiple sclerosis and other diseases that damage myelin. They share some symptoms, like muscle weakness, numbness, loss of vision, and loss of balance. But MS is rare in children. Other differences can also help your doctor make the right diagnosis. Kids with ADEM may have a fever, a headache, seizures, or trouble thinking clearly. The disease usually appears soon after a viral illness. There's no such link with MS.

478,How is oral cancer treated?,Cancer is defined as the uncontrollable growth of cells that invade and cause damage to surrounding tissue.
478,What is oral cancer?,"Oral cancer appears as a growth or sore in the mouth that does not go away. Oral cancer, which includes cancers of the lips, tongue, cheeks, floor of the mouth, hard and soft palate, sinuses, and pharynx (throat), can be life threatening if not diagnosed and treated early."
478,What can I do to prevent oral cancer?,"To prevent oral cancer: Don't smoke or use any tobacco products and drink alcohol in moderation (and refrain from binge drinking). Eat a well balanced diet. Limit your exposure to the sun. Repeated exposure increases the risk of cancer on the lip, especially the lower lip. When in the sun, use UV- A/ B-blocking sun protective lotions on your skin, as well as your lips."
478,What is the outlook for people with oral cancer?,"The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with an early diagnosis of oral cavity and pharynx cancers is 84%. If the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, organs, or lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate drops to 65%."
478,Who gets oral cancer?,"It's estimated that over 50,000 people in the U. S. received a diagnosis of oral cancer in 2019. Risk factors for the development of oral cancer include: Smoking . Cigarette, cigar, or pipe smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop oral cancers. Smokeless tobacco users. Users of dip, snuff, or chewing tobacco products are 50 times more likely to develop cancers of the cheek, gums, and lining of the lips. Excessive consumption of alcohol. Oral cancers are about six times more common in drinkers than in nondrinkers. Family history of cancer. Excessive sun exposure, especially at a young age. Human papillomavirus ( HPV). Certain HPV strains are etiologic risk factors for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( OSCC). The American Cancer Society recommends oral cancer screening exams every 3 years for persons over age 20 and annually for those over age 40."
478,How is oral cancer diagnosed?,"A biopsy may be needed to determine the makeup of a suspicious looking area. There are different types of biopsies and your doctor can determine which one is best. Many doctors don't use brush biopsies because while they're very easy, they still need a scalpel biopsy to confirm the results if the brush biopsy is positive. Also there are different types of scalpel biopsies, incisional and excisional, depending whether only a piece or the whole area is needed to determine what the nature of the problem is. Some doctors perform these biopsies with lasers. Feel for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of your neck and under your lower jaw. Call your dentist's office immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of your mouth or any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above. During your next dental appointment, ask your dentist to perform an oral exam."
478,What are the symptoms of oral cancer?,"The most common symptoms of oral cancer include: Swellings/thickenings, lumps or bumps, rough spots/crusts/or eroded areas on the lips, gums, or other areas inside the mouth The development of velvety white, red, or speckled (white and red) patches in the mouth $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); Unexplained bleeding in the mouth Unexplained numbness, loss of feeling, or pain/tenderness in any area of the face, mouth, or neck Persistent sores on the face, neck, or mouth that bleed easily and do not heal within 2 weeks A soreness or feeling that something is caught in the back of the throat Difficulty chewing or swallowing, speaking, or moving the jaw or tongue Hoarseness, chronic sore throat, or change in voice Ear pain A change in the way your teeth or dentures fit together Dramatic weight loss If you notice any of these changes, contact your dentist or health care professional immediately. Call your dentist's office immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of your mouth or any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above."
479,How can infection cause breathlessness?,"If germs come into your body through your nose and mouth, they can travel to your lungs and cause an infection. This is called pneumonia. Anyone can get it, but you're at higher risk if your immune system is weak, you have a lung disease like asthma, or you smoke. Warning signs: Chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain. You may also bring up thick mucus when you cough."
479,How can anxiety cause breathlessness?,"When you're stressed or worried, the muscles that help you breathe tighten. This makes you breathe faster than normal. You may feel like you're not getting enough air, which can make you panic and make your breathing even shallower. Warning signs: Sweating, chest pain, feeling faint."
479,How can cancer can cause breathlessness?,"Some types of cancer cause fluid to build up in the space between your lungs and chest wall. This can make it painful to take a deep breath. Warning signs: Feeling like there's a weight on your chest, coughing, fever. You may also feel rundown and tired. What helps: Your doctor could prescribe a drug that eases swelling or helps your body get rid of extra fluid. In some cases, he'll need to remove the fluid and treat the area so it doesn't fill again."
479,How can allergies cause breathlessness?,"Pollen, mold, and other allergens do more than cause itchy eyes and a runny nose. They can also irritate the airways in your lungs. This can trigger an asthma attack and make it hard for you to take normal breaths. Warning signs: Coughing, wheezing, chest tightness. Symptoms may last a few minutes or several days."
479,How can anemia cause breathlessness?,"This can lead to a condition called anemia. Some people get pale skin and cold hands and feet. Anyone can get it, but you're at higher risk if your immune system is weak, you have a lung disease like asthma, or you smoke. Over time, that makes your body have fewer red blood cells."
479,What are hookworms?,"You can catch this parasite by walking barefoot through infected soil or by drinking or eating food that has hookworm eggs in it. Once hookworms get inside you, they grow in your intestines and feed on your blood. Warning signs: Weakness, feeling tired, stomach pain, diarrhea, weight loss. Hookworms are easy to treat."
479,What are treatments for breathlessness caused by anxiety?,"When you're stressed or worried, the muscles that help you breathe tighten. This makes you breathe faster than normal. Try to stay calm. Sit or lie down and relax your shoulders as much as you can. Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, and out through pursed lips (like you're blowing out a candle) for 8. This can help bring your breath back to normal."
479,What is myasthenia gravis?,"When you're stressed or worried, the muscles that help you breathe tighten. It prevents your nerves and muscles from âtalkingâ to each other like they should. You may notice a drooping eyelid or double vision. Other signs may be trouble with speaking, swallowing, or smiling, feeling tired, and weakness in your arms and legs. For a few people, symptoms go away on their own. But most need drugs to get your nerves and muscles âtalkingâ again."
480,How do you make memories?,"For something to become a memory, three functions must occur, including: Acquisition -- learning or experiencing something new Consolidation -- the memory becomes stable in the brain Recall -- having the ability to access the memory in the future Both acquisition and recall are functions that take place when you are awake. However, researchers believe sleep is required for consolidation of a memory, no matter the memory type."
480,What happens when you sleep?,"Scientists don't know exactly how sleep enhances memory, but it appears to involve the brain's hippocampus and neocortex -- the part of the brain where long-term memories are stored. It is thought that during sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, where it reviews and processes memories, helping them to last for the long term."
480,What does sleep affect?,"Studies show that sleep affects physical reflexes, fine motor skills, and judgment, too. One study showed that participants who were sleep deprived were more likely to think they were right when they were, in fact, wrong. Studies involving memory tests show that after a single night of sleep, or even a nap, people perform better, whether on a test, in the office, on the athletic field, or in a concert hall."
480,Why is sleep important for memory?,Imaging and behavioral studies continue to show the critical role sleep plays in learning and memory. Researchers believe that sleep affects learning and memory in two ways: Lack of sleep impairs a person's ability to focus and learn efficiently. Sleep is necessary to consolidate a memory (make it stick) so that it can be recalled in the future.
480,What are tips to help you get more sleep?,"Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Get regular exercise, but do not exercise close to bedtime. Experts recommend allowing at least three hours between exercise and bed. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before going to sleep. Take time to unwind before going to sleep. Take a warm bath, read a book, drink some caffeine-free tea, and avoid any activities that can cause tension. Finish eating two to three hours before going to bed. Create a pleasant sleeping environment: make the room dark, cool, and comfortable. Use a sound machine, or other type of white noise device, to block out unwanted sounds. Do not watch TV or use the computer in bed. Use your bedroom for sleep and sex only. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including getting regular and quality sleep, can be a challenge, especially when you are stressed with a work deadline or test. But, remember (and you need sleep to do this! ), sleep is your friend. So, when it comes to learning and memory, sleep on it."
481,How does weight affect someone with diabetes getting pregnant?,"At this appointment, you and the doctor will discuss: Your weight: Try to reach your ideal body weight before you get pregnant. If you have a few extra pounds, losing them will help prevent complications from diabetes. If you're underweight, adding pounds can make you less likely to deliver a low-birth-weight baby."
481,Is blood sugar important during pregnancy?,"Your blood sugar: The doctor will check to see if your blood sugar is in control. This is key, because you may not know you're pregnant until the baby has been growing for 2-4 weeks. High blood sugar during the first 13 weeks can cause birth defects, lead to miscarriage, and put you at risk for diabetes complications."
481,What are some lifestyle changes that need to happen before someone with diabetes gets pregnant?,"Your lifestyle: If you smoke or drink alcohol, you'll need to stop. Smoking during pregnancy affects both you and the baby before, during, and after birth. When you smoke, the nicotine (the addictive substance in cigarettes), carbon monoxide, and other toxins travel through your bloodstream and go directly to your baby. These substances can: Deprive you and the baby of oxygen Raise the baby's heart rate Boost the chances of miscarriage and stillbirth Increase the odds of a premature, low-birth-weight baby Make the baby prone to future problems with the lungs or breathing Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a pattern of birth defects that includes intellectual disability and certain physical problems. No amount of alcohol is known to be safe while pregnant, and there's no safe time during pregnancy to drink."
481,Why is drinking alcohol while pregnant bad?,"These substances can: Deprive you and the baby of oxygen Raise the baby's heart rate Boost the chances of miscarriage and stillbirth Increase the odds of a premature, low-birth-weight baby Make the baby prone to future problems with the lungs or breathing Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a pattern of birth defects that includes intellectual disability and certain physical problems.

481,How will diabetes medications change during pregnancy?,"Your medications: You'll need more insulin during pregnancy, especially the last 3 months. The doctor will tell you how to adjust your dose. If you take diabetes pills, the doctor may switch you to insulin, because some of these drugs can harm the baby. So can some high blood pressure treatments used with diabetes. Bottom line: Discuss all medications you take with your doctor."
481,What is preconception counseling?,"At that visit, your doctor will: Order an A1 C test to find out if your diabetes is controlled well enough for you to stop using birth control Test your blood and urine for diabetes-related kidney complications Look for other problems linked with diabetes, like organ, nerve, or heart damage Take your blood pressure Rule out thyroid disease (if you have type 1 diabetes) Check your cholesterol and levels of a type of blood fat called triglycerides Suggest an eye exam to screen for glaucoma, cataracts, and retinopathy Recommend pre-conception counseling This is another important step for women with diabetes. This educational session will help you get physically and emotionally prepared -- and healthy -- for pregnancy."
482,How often should you check your blood sugar if you're pregnant?,"How often should you check your blood sugar? Pre-existing diabetes: Before and after meals and before bedtime Gestational diabetes: Before breakfast and after every meal; your doctor can tell you how long after eating you should check. If you are pregnant and have type 1 diabetes, your doctor might sometimes ask you to check your blood sugar in the middle of the night, around 3 a.m."
482,Why is it important to continually check blood sugar levels if you are pregnant with diabetes?,"Tight control will help you avoid complications and long-term health problems for both you and your baby. You're eating differently because your body needs more energy to help your baby grow and be healthy. And your changing hormones affect how your body makes and uses insulin. In the later parts of your pregnancy, you may become more insulin resistant, so blood sugar builds up to higher levels. If you are pregnant and have type 1 diabetes, your doctor might sometimes ask you to check your blood sugar in the middle of the night, around 3 a.m."

483,What is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the eye?,These cells absorb excess light so the photoreceptors can give a clearer signal. They also move nutrients to (and waste from) the photoreceptors to the choroid. The choroid is separate from the RPE.
483,What are photoreceptors?,They're special nerve endings that convert the light into electrochemical signals.
483,Where does the light that enters the eye go?,"Its final destination is the retina, which lines the back of your eye. It's like the screen in a movie theater or the film in a camera. The focused light hits cells called photoreceptors."
483,How does the lens of the eye work?,"It circulates throughout the front part of your eye and keeps pressure inside constant After the aqueous humor, light passes through the pupil. This is the central round opening in your iris, the colored part of your eye. It changes size to control how much light gets in farther back. Next up is the lens. It works just like a camera to focus light. It adjusts shape depending on whether the light reflects off something near to you or far away."
483,"What is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), choroid, and sclera in the retina?","These cells absorb excess light so the photoreceptors can give a clearer signal. They also move nutrients to (and waste from) the photoreceptors to the choroid. The choroid is separate from the RPE. It lies behind the retina and is made up of many fine blood vessels that supply nutrition to the retina and the RPE. Sclera is the tough, white, fibrous outside wall of your eye. It's connected to the clear cornea in front."
483,"What are the blood vessels, macula, and photoreceptors in the retina?","Unlike a movie screen, the retina has many parts: Blood vessels bring nutrients to your nerve cells. The macula is the bull's-eye at the center of your retina. The dead center is called the fovea. Because it's the focal point of your eye, it has more special, light-sensitive nerve endings, called photoreceptors, than any other part. Photoreceptors come in two kinds: rods and cones. They're special nerve endings that convert the light into electrochemical signals."

And that's how you see: Light, reflected from an object, enters the eye, gets focused, is converted into electrochemical signals, delivered to the brain, and is interpreted, or ""seen,"" as an image."
