0,What are the symptoms of heart failure?,"Symptoms of heart failure include: Shortness of breath Swelling in the feet, ankles, or abdomen Difficulty sleeping flat in bed Bloating Irregular pulse Nausea Fatigue Greater need to urinate at night High blood pressure can also cause ischemic heart disease."
0,Can high blood pressure bring on heart failure?,"High blood pressure may also bring on heart failure by causing left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle that results in less effective muscle relaxation between heart beats. This makes it difficult for the heart to fill with enough blood to supply the body's organs, especially during exercise, leading your body to hold onto fluids and your heart rate to increase."

1,How do new gum disease treatments lead to a better dental health?,"When the supporting tissue and bone around your teeth doesn't fit snugly, ""pockets"" form in the gums. Bacteria then invade these pockets, increasing bone destruction and tooth loss. A variety of treatments can help reverse the damage. They range from cleaning the root surfaces to remove plaque and tartar to more extreme measures such as gum surgery to reduce the pockets. In recent years, the focus of gum disease treatment has expanded beyond reducing the pockets and removing the bacteria to include regenerative procedures. For instance, lasers, membranes, bone grafts, or proteins that stimulate tissue growth can be used to help regenerate bone and tissue to combat the gum disease."
1,How does computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology benefit my dental health?,"The CAD in this technology stands for âcomputer-assisted design,â and the CAM for âcomputer-assisted manufacture.â Together, they translate into fewer dental visits to complete procedures such as crowns and bridges. Traditionally when a patient needs a crown, a dentist must make a mold of the tooth and fashion a temporary crown, then wait for the dental laboratory to make a permanent one. With CAD/ CAM technology, the tooth is drilled to prepare it for the crown and a picture is taken with a computer. This image is then relayed to a machine that makes the crown right in the office."
1,How can thinner veneers improve my dental health?,"Veneers are the thin, custom-made shells or moldings that are used to cover the front of crooked or otherwise unattractive teeth. New materials now make it possible to create even thinner veneers that are just as strong. What's the advantage for you? Preparing a tooth for a veneer - which involves reshaping the tooth to allow for the added thickness of the veneer -- can be minimal with the thinner veneers. Less of the tooth surface must be reduced and more of the natural tooth is kept intact."
1,How can the diode laser help my dental health?,"That's the instrument they poke around with in your mouth during a checkup. When it ""sticks"" in a tooth, they look closer to see if they find decay. Many dentists are now switching to the diode laser, a higher-tech option for detecting tooth decay. When healthy teeth are exposed to the wavelength of the diode laser, they don't glow or fluoresce, so the reading on the digital display is low. The diode laser doesn't always work with teeth that already have fillings, but for other teeth, it could mean earlier detection of cavities. Note also that the diode laser does not replace X-rays; it detects decay in grooves on the chewing surface, while bitewing X-rays can find decay between and inside teeth."
1,How does a digital dental X-ray work?,"In many dental offices, digitized X-rays (think digital camera) are replacing traditional radiographs. First, an electronic sensor or phosphor plate (instead of film) is placed in the patient's mouth to capture the image. The digital image is then relayed or scanned to a computer, where it is available for viewing. The procedure is much faster than processing conventional film. Your dentist can also store digital images on the computer and compare them with previous or future images to see how your dental health is being maintained. And because the sensor and phosphor plates are more sensitive to X-rays than film is, the radiation dose is significantly reduced."

That's the organ that destroys your platelets, so taking it out can give your platelet count a boost. This drug is a type of treatment known as biologic therapy. Side effects for rituximab include: Fever Chills Weakness Nausea Headaches Weakened immune system Rho( D) immune globulin."
10,What is a Rho(D) immune globulin and how does it treat thrombocytopenia?,"The advantage of IVIG is that it can raise your platelet count quickly. This treatment, which you also take through an IV, is an alternative to traditional IVIG in people who have Rh+ blood."
10,What medical conditions can cause thrombocytopenia?,"If you have thrombocytopenia, you don't have enough platelets in your blood. Other Treatments Heart bypass surgery Radiation treatment on your bone marrow Medical Conditions Blood cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma A problem with your bone marrow, like toxicity from drinking too much alcohol Vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9) deficiency Pregnancy. Up to 5% of healthy women get it during pregnancy, and it usually gets better on its own after your baby is born. But it can also be a sign of something more concerning, like preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. An enlarged spleen Your body uses too many platelets, leaving you without enough of them. That can happen if you have an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Rare disorders like hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP), which uses a lot of platelets to make small blood clots throughout your body Usually, thrombocytopenia has no symptoms."
10,What are some side effects of prednisone to treat thrombocytopenia?,"Dexamethasone or prednisone is typically prescribed to raise your platelet count. Even after a short time, you can get irritable, have stomach upsets, and have other problems such as: Sleep problems Weight gain Puffy cheeks Peeing a lot Lower bone density Acne Besides side effects, another disadvantage to prednisone is that your platelet count may drop once you've finished your treatment."
10,What are medicines that can cause fewer platelets leading to thrombocytopenia?,"If you have thrombocytopenia, you don't have enough platelets in your blood. If your thrombocytopenia is not due to ITP, your body might have fewer platelets because of these causes: Viral infections (including chickenpox, parvovirus, hepatitis C, Epstein- Barr, and HIV) Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia Sepsis, a severe bacterial infection in your blood Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori), a bacteria that can live in your digestive system Medicines Medication side effects, including drugs for heart problems, seizures, and infections Heparin, a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots Chemotherapy Work with your doctor to figure out if a drug is causing your platelet count to drop."
11,Can prescription drugs lead to erectile dysfunction?,Prescription drugs : There are more than 200 prescription drugs that can cause erectile dysfunction. Speak with your doctor if you think one of your medications may be causing this in you.
11,Can prostate enlargement lead to erectile dysfunction?,Prostate enlargement : It's a normal part of aging for many men.
11,"Why can tobacco, alcohol, or drug use lead to erectile dysfunction?","Tobacco , alcohol, or drug use: All three can damage your blood vessels. If you have artery problems, smoking will make ED much more likely."
11,What diseases can lead to erectile dysfunction?,"Sometimes, another disease will lead to ED, including the following: Diabetes: Nerves and blood vessels that aid in getting you ready for sex are damaged by this. Kidney disease : Along with the other issues associated with kidney disease, your hormones, blood flow to your penis, and your nervous system -- all vital for getting an erection -- are affected. Things like stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease disrupt vital signals. Blood vessel diseases: These can slow the flow of blood, making your body's preparation for sex difficult. Prostate enlargement : It's a normal part of aging for many men."
11,What can lead to erectile dysfunction?,"If all goes well, you're ready for sex. Stress, depression, anxiety, and alcohol use can often trigger it. In other cases, physical factors are the culprit. Venous leak: To keep an erection, the blood that flows into your penis has to stay a while."
11,What physical problems can lead to erectile dysfunction?,"Blood then flows into your penis. Nerve and brain disorders: You can't get an erection without help from your nervous system. Other reasons for ED can include: Surgery: Nerves and tissue needed for an erection can be affected during procedures to treat prostate and bladder cancer. If it flows out too quickly, you'll lose your erection. Injury or disease can cause this. If you think you may have it, talk with your doctor and figure out the plan that's best for you."
12,What is recovery like in an endometrial ablation?,"It shouldn't take you long to heal from an ablation. Most women are back to their normal routine within a week. You may have some cramping and bleeding for a few days and a watery or bloody discharge for up to 3 weeks. It's also common to have nausea and an urge to pee for the first 24 hours. Your doctor will advise you not to have sex, use tampons, or douche for a few days. She may also put limits on your activity, like not lifting heavy things right away. If you need medicine for pain, ask your doctor which over-the-counter medicines are safe to take. Don't take aspirin. It could make you bleed more."
12,What are common procedures in an endometrial ablation?,"The most common are: Hydrothermal: Your doctor gently pumps fluid into your uterus, then heats it. After 10 minutes, this destroys your uterine lining. Balloon therapy: Your doctor guides a thin tube with a special balloon on the end into your uterus. Heated fluid fills the balloon, which then expands and breaks up the lining. High-energy radio waves: Your doctor puts electrical mesh into your uterus and expands it. Then energy and heat sent by strong radio waves damage the lining, which your doctor removes with suction. Freezing: A thin probe with a very cold tip freezes off the lining of your uterus. Your doctor may call this âcryoablation.â Microwave: A special wand applies microwave energy to your uterine lining, which destroys it. Electrical: Your doctor can use an electric current to destroy the lining of your uterus, but this method isn't as commonly used as the others."
12,Who gets an endometrial ablation?,"Endometrial ablation can put an end to heavy bleeding that gets in the way of your everyday life (maybe you need to change your tampon or pad every hour, or you bleed for more than a week). If your bleeding causes other health problems, like anemia, this procedure could also help."
12,Who shouldn't get an endometrial ablation?,"Still, endometrial ablation isn't right for everyone. If you're post-menopausal, you shouldn't have it done. It's also not a good idea if you have: Uterine, cervical, or endometrial cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) A vaginal or cervical infection A weak wall to your uterus An infection of the uterus A scar from a Caesarean section An intrauterine device ( IUD) A disorder of the uterus or endometrium You also shouldn't have endometrial ablation if you're pregnant or want a baby in the future. It will make it harder for you to get pregnant."
12,When should you call your doctor about endometrial ablation?,"If you have any of these signs, call your doctor right away: Strong-smelling discharge from your vagina Fever Chills Intense cramping or stomach pain Heavy bleeding or bleeding that doesn't stop 2 days after your ablation Trouble peeing The results of endometrial ablation don't always last. After a few years, your periods may start to get heavier and longer again. If so, let your doctor know. You may need a different treatment."
12,What happens in an endometrial ablation?,"Still, endometrial ablation isn't right for everyone. Instead, she will insert very thin tools through your vagina to reach your uterus. The types will depend on what kind of ablation she does. It could make you bleed more."
12,What is an endometrial ablation?,"An endometrial ablation is a procedure your doctor might consider if you bleed between your menstrual periods, have a heavy flow, or have periods that last a long time. It can curb the bleeding or stop it totally. Heavy menstrual bleeding can have many causes. Changing hormones might be the reason. Or it could be fibroids and polyps growing in your uterus. Endometrial ablation removes the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. In most cases, this stops you from having periods. If it doesn't completely stop your periods, your flow should at least return to normal or be very light. If you have any of these signs, call your doctor right away: Strong-smelling discharge from your vagina Fever Chills Intense cramping or stomach pain Heavy bleeding or bleeding that doesn't stop 2 days after your ablation Trouble peeing The results of endometrial ablation don't always last."
12,What are the risks of an endometrial ablation?,"The tools your doctor uses for your ablation could also create a hole in your uterus, cause burns, or harm nearby organs. But these problems don't happen very often. The chances that you'll get hurt during an endometrial ablation are low. If you have any of these signs, call your doctor right away: Strong-smelling discharge from your vagina Fever Chills Intense cramping or stomach pain Heavy bleeding or bleeding that doesn't stop 2 days after your ablation Trouble peeing The results of endometrial ablation don't always last."
13,What can make you retain water?,"They include: High blood pressure medication Pain relievers known as NSAIDs, including ibuprofen Antidepressants Chemotherapy medication Ask your doctor if your meds may be the problem."
14,How do checkpoint inhibitors work?,"They help the immune system tell if other cells are a normal part of your body and should be left alone or invaders that should be attacked. Cancer cells can trick your immune system by binding to the cells that are supposed to fight it. When that happens, the checkpoint signals your body not to attack. A checkpoint inhibitor stops these cells from binding. That way, your immune system recognizes and targets the cancer."
14,How can immunotherapy drugs treat metastatic bladder cancer?,"Your immune system is designed to fight infection and diseases, including cancer. But cancer cells can grow unchecked because they avoid your body's defenses. Immunotherapy drugs work by making cancer cells easier targets or by boosting the immune system to make it more effective against the disease."
14,What checkpoint inhibitor drugs treat metastatic bladder cancer?,"There are now several immunotherapy drugs used to treat metastatic bladder cancer. These drugs are called checkpoint inhibitors. The FDA has approved several checkpoint inhibitor drugs for advanced bladder cancer that has gotten worse during of after chemotherapy. These include: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Avelumab ( Bavencio) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) These drugs are given every 2-3 weeks by infusion, which means through a tube (an IV) that goes into a vein."
15,What prescription treatments are available for hot flashes?,"Prescription treatments include: Low-dose depression drugs like fluoxetine ( Prozac, Rapiflux), paroxetine ( Paxil, Pexeva), or venlafaxine ( Effexor) Clonidine, a blood pressure medication Gabapentin, an anti-seizure drug Brisdelle, a paroxetine formula specifically for hot flashes Duavee, a conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene formula designed to treat hot flashes B complex vitamins, vitamin E, and ibuprofen may help, too."

15,How can I manage my hot flashes?,"Wear lightweight, looser-fitting clothes made with natural fibers such as cotton. Try deep, slow abdominal breathing (6 to 8 breaths per minute). Practice deep breathing for 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes in the evening, and when a hot flash starts. Exercise daily. Walking, swimming, bicycling, and dancing are all good choices. Plant estrogens, found in soy products, may have weak estrogen-like effects that could cut hot flashes. Doctors recommend you get your soy from foods like tofu and edamame rather than supplements. Some studies suggest black cohosh may be helpful for 6 months or less. Botanicals and herbs may have side effects or change how other medications work, so ask your doctor first. Some women can wait out hot flashes with no treatment. If HRT isn't right for you, other treatments may offer relief."
16,What are eye-related symptoms of Graves' disease?,"Graves' ophthalmopathy can cause a wide range of issues with your eyes. Some people might have a little redness and minor pain, while others have strong swelling, dryness, and more severe pain. It's also possible to have bulging eyes -- because your muscles swell and your eyes are pushed out -- and pressure may build up in your eye socket. In rare cases, you can have double vision or other problems with your sight."
16,How are eye problems related to Graves' disease diagnosed?,"If you know you have Graves', your doctor should be able to find out if you have the eye problem with a standard eye exam. In some cases, you may need blood tests, or imaging tests like a computerized tomography ( CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scan. With a CT scan, X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to make a more complete picture. And an MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images. If you haven't been diagnosed with Graves' disease, step one probably will be to get your thyroid hormone levels checked with a simple blood test."
16,Why do people with Graves' disease have eye issues?,"About half of people with Graves' disease notice some eye issues, and some have severe vision problems. Experts think this happens because the tissues in your eyes have proteins like ones in your thyroid gland. The problem is known as Graves' eye disease or Graves' ophthalmopathy. Doctors don't think it can be prevented, but you're more likely to get it -- and have a worse case of it -- if you smoke."

People who have severe hyperthyroidism aren't necessarily more likely to have eye trouble than those who have milder cases."
16,"If I think I'm getting Graves' disease and it's affecting my eyes, what kind of doctor do I need to see?","If you think you may be developing Graves' ophthalmopathy, you may need to see both an endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in problems with hormones) and an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). If you know you have Graves', your doctor should be able to find out if you have the eye problem with a standard eye exam."
16,How are eye problems related to Graves' disease treated?,"A number of things can help: Artificial tears, gels, and ointments can go a long way toward easing dryness. If you have a lot of swelling -- especially if it leads to double vision or loss of vision -- you might need to take a steroid called prednisone for a few weeks to bring the swelling down. In the rare cases when these don't work, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove some tissue from your eye socket or radiation therapy, where high-energy X-rays are aimed at the eye muscle. Graves' ophthalmopathy tends to get better after a few years, but you may have eye problems that need to be corrected with surgery. For example, you might need surgery to ease pain and pressure on your optic nerve, fix the alignment of your eye muscles, or make sure your eyelids cover and protect your eyes."
16,When do you need surgery for eye problems caused by Graves' disease?,"It's also possible to have bulging eyes -- because your muscles swell and your eyes are pushed out -- and pressure may build up in your eye socket. If you think you may be developing Graves' ophthalmopathy, you may need to see both an endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in problems with hormones) and an ophthalmologist (eye doctor)."

19,Can sexual intercourse be a trigger for genital herpes?,"Other triggers of genital herpes may include: Sexual intercourse. Some people find that the friction of sexual intercourse irritates the skin and brings on symptoms. Using a water-based lubricant can help reduce irritation. Don't use one that contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9, however. Nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes, such as the lining of the vagina. Oil-based lubricants are a no-no, too. They weaken latex, making condoms more likely to break. Even if the friction of intercourse seems to be a trigger for symptoms, it probably won't cause a flare-up every time you have sex."
19,Can colds and sunlight be triggers for genital herpes?,"The common cold and sunlight seem to trigger outbreaks of oral herpes (cold sores), but no proof exists that they trigger genital herpes outbreaks."
20,How do doctors choose breast cancer treatments?,"Your doctor will think about many things before she recommends treatments for you, including: The type of breast cancer you have How fast it's growing Your age and how healthy you are If you've had breast cancer before If your tumor has female hormones or other genetic factors, such as the HER2 oncogene, that make it grow faster."

21,Does menopause make your breast sore?,"Because the hormonal changes of perimenopause make your cycle irregular, breast soreness can strike unpredictably, according to the National Cancer Institute. What You Can Do About It: If your breasts hurt, wearing the right bra can make a big difference: 85% of women with breast pain gained relief when they wore a well-fitted sports bra, according to a 2014 study. The same researchers found that relaxation techniques or massaging achy breasts with over-the-counter pain creams was helpful for up to 60% of women."
21,When should you see a doctor about breast changes during menopause?,"Talk to your doctor if you notice any of these problems: A lump or a firm or thick area in your breast or under your arm. Nipple discharge fluid or changes, such as a nipple that becomes sunken into the breast, also called ""inverted."" Skin changes, such as redness, dimpling, puckering, or ridges that look like orange peel. Unexplained swelling or shrinkage of the breast, especially on one side only. Most of the time, breast changes are not cancer, but it's important to get any new or unusual symptom checked out quickly."
21,Does menopause change your breast size?,"As your milk system starts to shut down, glandular tissue in your breasts shrinks. That causes them to become less dense and more fatty, which can lead to sagging. You may also notice that your breasts aren't as full as they used to be, and their size may change. Although there's no proven way to reverse sagging, exercise makes your breasts look better by developing and toning the muscles underneath. Some lingerie styles, such as a pushup or underwire bra, can give you a youthful lift. For maximum boost and support, make sure your bra fits correctly: By some estimates, up 70% of women are wearing the wrong size."

Some types of work, like farming or factory jobs, can cause you to have contact with chemicals linked to Parkinson's. Race. It shows up more often in white people than other groups. Serious head injury. If you hit your head hard enough to lose consciousness or forget things as a result of it, you may be more likely to get Parkinson's later in life. Gender. Men get it more than women. Doctors aren't sure why. Where you live. People in rural areas seem to get it more often, which may be tied to chemicals used in farming."
22,What's been linked to Parkinson's disease?,"Some research shows links between Parkinson's and: Agent Orange, a chemical used to destroy trees and crops in the Vietnam War. Certain chemicals used in farming, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Some metals and chemicals used in factories, such as manganese, lead, and trichlorethylene ( TCE)."
22,Can parents pass Parkinson's disease to their kids?,"They can, but it's rare and only affects a small number of families. About 1 in 100 people with Parkinson's get it this way."
22,What role do genes play in Parkinson's disease?,"There are several changes to genes that can raise your risk for Parkinson's, each by a little bit. They have a part in about 1 in 10 cases. If you have one or more of these changes, it doesn't mean you'll get Parkinson's. Some people will, but many won't, and doctors don't know why. It may have to do with other genes or something in your environment."
22,What causes Parkinson's disease?,"They do know that if you have the illness, the trouble starts in some of your brain cells. It acts like a messenger that tells another area of your brain when you want to move a part of your body. When the cells that make dopamine start to die, your dopamine level drops. When it gets too low, you can't control your movements as well and you start to get Parkinson's symptoms."
22,What role does the environment play in Parkinson's disease?,"Your environment is a hard one to pin down. Not only that, but it could take years for the effects from something in your environment to show up. So far, doctors have a lot of clues but no smoking gun. So you could have people who live or work in an area around chemicals tied to Parkinson's, but many of them don't get it. Where you live."
23,How can sickle cell disease affect your immune system?,"Sickle cells can damage your spleen, the organ that helps fight germs as part of your immune system. That can make you more likely to get pneumonia and other infections."
23,What is sickle cell crisis?,It happens when you don't have enough red blood cells to move oxygen throughout your body.
23,Which vaccines should I get if I have sickle cell disease?,"Vaccines can protect you and your child against germs.

23,How can hydroxyurea help treat sickle cell disease?,"A medicine called hydroxyurea ( Droxia, Hydrea, Sikos) prevents abnormal red blood cells from forming. This cuts down on episodes of sickle cell crises. Hydroxyurea can cause serious side effects, like a plunge in the number of white blood cells that help your body fight infections. So your doctor will watch you closely while you're on it. You shouldn't take hydroxyurea if you're pregnant."

An abnormal or poorly placed bone or joint (such as length differences in your legs or arthritis in a joint) can put added stress on a bursa sac, causing bursitis. Stress or inflammation from other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, thyroid disorders, or unusual medication reactions may also increase a person's risk.

It works best for small or medium stones. It's noninvasive, which means no cuts are made in your skin. During this procedure, you lie on a table. You'll get medicine beforehand to limit any pain or discomfort. The doctor uses an X-ray or ultrasound to find the stone (or stones) in your kidney. Then, she aims high-energy shock waves at your kidney from the outside. These waves go through your skin and break up the stone into small pieces. The doctor might put a tube called a stent into your ureter (urine flows through this from your kidneys to your bladder). This stent helps the pieces of stone pass. SWL takes about an hour. You'll usually go home on the same day. Afterward, you'll drink lots of water to flush the stone pieces out in your urine. You might have to pee through a strainer to catch pieces of the stone so she can test them. SWL removes kidney stones in about half of people who have it. If it doesn't work, you might need to have the procedure repeated."
42,How does ureteroscopy work to treat kidney stones?,"More serious problems are less likely, but can include: Bleeding around the kidney Infection Damage to the kidney Stone that blocks the flow of urine This procedure treats stones in the kidneys and ureters. Your doctor uses a thin, flexible scope to find and remove stones. No cuts are made in your skin. You'll sleep through this procedure. Your doctor will pass the scope through your bladder and ureter into your kidney. She uses a small basket to remove small stones. If the stones are larger, the doctor will pass a laser through the scope to break them up. You usually are able to go home on the same day. The doctor might place a stent in your ureter to help urine drain from your kidney into your bladder. You'll go back to the doctor after 4 to 10 days to have the stent taken out. Some stents have a string on the end so you can pull it out yourself. Be sure to carefully follow your doctor's instructions about taking out a stent yourself."

42,How does a percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy work to treat kidney stones?,"Possible problems after a ureteroscopy include: Infection Narrowing of the ureter Bleeding If your stone is large or lithotripsy doesn't break it up enough, this surgery is an option. PCNL uses a small tube to reach the stone and break it up with high-frequency sound waves. You will be given something so that you won't be awake during this surgery. Your surgeon will make a small cut in your back or side and place a thin scope into the hole."
42,How is a percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy done to treat kidney stones?,"The surgery can be done in one of two ways: Nephrolithotomy: Your surgeon removes the stone through a tube Nephrolithotripsy: Your surgeon uses sound waves or a laser to break up the stone and then vacuums up the pieces with a suction machine. The surgery takes 20 to 45 minutes. You'll typically have to stay in the hospital for a day or two afterward. Usually, a stent will have to stay in your kidney for a few days to help urine drain. Your doctor might do an X-ray or ultrasound a few weeks later to see whether any parts of the stone are left. She might also send the stone fragments to a lab to find out what they're made of."
42,What are the risks from a percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy for kidney stones?,"Risks from this surgery include: Infection Bleeding Damage to the bladder, bowel, ureter, kidney, or liver Open surgery is rarely done for kidney stones anymore."
42,What are side effects of shock wave lithotripsy for kidney stones?,"The procedure can cause side effects such as cramps or blood in your urine. More serious problems are less likely, but can include: Bleeding around the kidney Infection Damage to the kidney Stone that blocks the flow of urine This procedure treats stones in the kidneys and ureters."
42,When do I need surgery for a kidney stone?,"You're in a lot of pain. The stone is blocking the flow of urine out of your kidney. You have had many urinary tract infections because of the stone.

42,What should you know about treating a kidney stone?,"They start small, but they can grow bigger as more minerals stick to them. Some kidney stones often pass on their own without treatment. Other stones that are painful or that get stuck in your urinary tract sometimes need to be removed with surgery. The procedure can cause side effects such as cramps or blood in your urine."
42,How is open surgery done to treat kidney stones?,"Your surgeon will make a small cut in your back or side and place a thin scope into the hole. Risks from this surgery include: Infection Bleeding Damage to the bladder, bowel, ureter, kidney, or liver Open surgery is rarely done for kidney stones anymore. But if your stone is very large or it can't be removed or crushed with other treatments, surgery might be an option. Surgery may also help if: One of the stones is stuck in your ureter. You're in a lot of pain. The stone is blocking your urine flow. You're bleeding or you have an infection. She will remove the stone through the opening. A stent is placed in the ureter to help urine drain. You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. It can take 4 to 6 weeks to fully heal after open surgery."
43,How can you avoid trouble sleeping from treating adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"Some ADHD medications can rev you up and make it hard to fall asleep. Take your medication earlier in the day, so it wears off well before bedtime. If you're on a long-acting stimulant, you could ask your doctor about trying a short-acting one, where the effects will fade more quickly. Limit or avoid caffeine, too. Turn off your TV, computers, and phones an hour or so before going to bed, and take time to relax."

Usually these fade over time, but talk to your doctor if they don't go away."
43,How can you avoid loss of appetite from treating adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"Some drugs can make you not want to eat much. But don't skip meals. That can lead to low blood sugar, and that may make it harder to focus. Instead, eat several small meals a day, rather than three bigger ones. Eat dinner later in the evening, after the effects of your medication have worn off. You may feel hungry then. Sometimes the worse appetite leads to weight loss. It's usually just a small amount, but tell your doctor if you think you're losing too much weight."
43,How can you avoid dry mouth from treating adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"Drink plenty of fluids, and use lozenges to keep your mouth moist."
43,What are other ways to treat adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,Doctors sometimes treat adults with drugs that aren't FDA-approved for ADHD. This is called âoff labelâ use. Because these drugs have different side effects -- and benefits and risks -- you should go over the specifics with your doctor.
43,When should I consider going to the doctor for side effects of ADHD medication?,"Many people feel the side effects of their ADHD medications are worth dealing with to get the benefits of the drugs. But if they're severe or interfering with your life, don't try to ignore them. Get help from your doctor. Together, you'll be able to come up with a plan that works best for you."
43,How effective are treatments for adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,There's no way to know how well a medicine will work for you. Some people do better on one drug than another. It can take a few tries to find the right one.
43,What can I do if my ADHD medication causes dry mouth?,"Drink plenty of fluids, and use lozenges to keep your mouth moist."
43,Are the side effects of medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder worth it?,"Many people feel the side effects of their ADHD medications are worth dealing with to get the benefits of the drugs. But if they're severe or interfering with your life, don't try to ignore them. Get help from your doctor. Together, you'll be able to come up with a plan that works best for you."
43,Which ADHD medication is least likely to cause side effects?,"There's no way to know how well a medicine will work for you. Some people do better on one drug than another. It can take a few tries to find the right one. If you have high blood pressure, heart problems, or a history of mental health issues or addiction, your doctor needs to know. These conditions may cause problems with your treatment."
43,What can I do if my ADHD medication causes tics?,"They can give you back your focus and a feeling of control. Usually these fade over time, but talk to your doctor if they don't go away."
43,How can you avoid nausea from treating adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"They can give you back your focus and a feeling of control. If you're supposed to take it in the morning and you're not a breakfast person, you may want to find something you can eat anyway."
43,What can I do if my ADHD medication makes me nauseous?,"They can give you back your focus and a feeling of control. If you're supposed to take it in the morning and you're not a breakfast person, you may want to find something you can eat anyway."
43,What can happen if you're taking medications for adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"If you're an adult with ADHD, medications can help a lot. They can give you back your focus and a feeling of control. But for many people, these perks come with a price -- side effects. Most of the time, they're mild and fade after a few weeks or months of treatment. Both types have similar side effects: Dizziness Dry Mouth Headaches Loss of Appetite Moodiness Tics Trouble sleeping There are simple things you can do to make taking these medications less of a problem."
43,What can I do if my ADHD medication causes dizziness?,"Check with your doctor. It's usually just a small amount, but tell your doctor if you think you're losing too much weight."
44,How long does recovery from trigger finger take?,"The time it takes to get better depends on how bad your condition is. The choice of treatment also affects recovery. For example, you may need to wear a splint for 6 weeks. But most patients with trigger finger recover within a few weeks by resting the finger and using anti-inflammatory drugs."
44,Why does trigger finger happen?,"A tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) thanks to the synovium, a membrane that surrounds joints and keeps them lubricated. Sometimes a tendon gets inflamed and swollen. Long-term irritation of the tendon sheath can lead to scarring and thickening that affect the tendon's motion. When this happens, bending your finger or thumb pulls the inflamed tendon through a narrowed sheath and makes it snap or pop."
44,What causes trigger finger?,"Most of the time, it comes from a repeated movement or forceful use of your finger or thumb. It can also happen when tendons -- tough bands of tissue that connect muscles and bones in your finger or thumb -- get inflamed."
44,Who gets trigger finger?,"Most of the time, it comes from a repeated movement or forceful use of your finger or thumb. Sex: It's more common in women than men. Job: It's common among farmers, industrial workers, musicians, and anyone else who repeats finger and thumb movements."
44,How is trigger finger diagnosed?,"Your doctor will start with a physical exam of your hand and fingers. The finger may be swollen, stiff, and painful. There are no X-rays or lab tests to diagnose trigger finger."
44,What are the symptoms of trigger finger?,"You might notice: A painful clicking or snapping when you bend or straighten your finger. Stiffness in your finger, especially in the morning Soreness or a bump at the base of the finger or thumb. It's often worse: In the morning When you grasp something firmly When you try to straighten your finger Things that make you more likely to get trigger finger include: Age: It usually shows up between ages 40 and 60. Or it could be locked in a bent position."
44,What is trigger finger?,"Trigger finger is a painful condition that makes your fingers or thumb catch or lock when you bend them. When it affects your thumb, it's called trigger thumb.."
44,How is trigger finger treated?,"Most of the time, you'll start with: Rest: Try not to move the finger or thumb. Splint: The doctor can give you one designed to keep your finger still. NSAIDs: Your doctor may suggest over-the-counter drugs that fight inflammation, like ibuprofen or naproxen. Steroid injections: She might give you a steroid shot into the tendon sheath. If you have severe symptoms or if other treatments don't work, your doctor may suggest a procedure."
45,What are the symptoms and diagnosis for insulin resistance?,"You can't tell that you have insulin resistance by how you feel. You'll need to get a blood test that checks your blood sugar levels. Likewise, you won't know if you have most of the other conditions that are part of insulin resistance syndrome (high blood pressure, low ""good"" cholesterol levels, and high triglycerides) without seeing your doctor."
45,What changes can make a difference for insulin resistance?,"You can't tell that you have insulin resistance by how you feel. This test measures your blood sugar after you haven't eaten for at least 8 hours. If you don't make changes in the way you eat and exercise, your blood sugar levels will rise until you have prediabetes. Get to a healthy weight . If you're not sure what you should weigh or how to reach a weight loss goal, ask your doctor. You may also want to talk with a nutritionist and a certified personal trainer. Eat a healthy diet. Think fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, fish, legumes, and other lean protein."
45,What does insulin resistance mean?,"Over time, your blood sugar levels go up. It could affect as many as 1 in 3 Americans. When you have insulin resistance, your pancreas makes extra insulin to make up for it. Eat a healthy diet."
45,What should I do if I have insulin resistance?,"You may need to take the test again to confirm the results. Go for at least 30 minutes a day of moderate activity (like brisk walking) 5 or more days a week. If you're not active now, work up to that. Think fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, fish, legumes, and other lean protein."
46,What are the symptoms of chronic heavy metal poisoning?,"You get this after contact with a low dose over a long time. As the metal builds up in your body, you can get sick. Symptoms come on slowly and can include: Headache Weakness and tiredness Achy joints and muscles Constipation Different tests can check for different types of heavy metals."
46,Is heavy metal poisoning common?,"Experts say that heavy metal poisoning is rare. But lots of websites claim it's common and blame it, without proof, for all sorts of health problems. Many businesses sell unreliable tests and expensive or even dangerous treatments. Hair analysis or chelation challenge tests (âprovoked urineâ tests). They're inaccurate. They can't tell you if you're sick or need treatment. Over-the-counter chelation treatments. These are not approved by the FDA, may not be safe, and there's no evidence that they work. If you think you have heavy metal poisoning, don't try to diagnose it or treat it on your own. See your doctor instead."
46,Which metals can cause heavy metal poisoning?,"Scientists group these elements based on their higher density, or atomic weights. Many heavy metals exist, including: Arsenic Cadmium Copper Iron Lead Mercury Zinc Not all of these metals are bad for you. We need small amounts of some of them, such as copper and iron, to keep our bodies healthy."
46,How does heavy metal poisoning happen?,This can happen if you eat or drink something tainted with heavy metals or if you breathe in contaminated dust or fumes.
47,What are the uses and limitations of an erythrocyte sedimentation rate test for lupus?,"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR) What it is: ESR measures the speed of red blood cells moving toward the bottom of a test tube. When inflammation is present, blood proteins stick together and fall and collect more quickly as sediment. The more quickly the blood cells fall, the greater the inflammation. Why the test is used: ESR is used as a marker of inflammation. Inflammation could indicate lupus activity. This test could be used to monitor inflammation, which could indicate changes in disease activity or response to treatment. Limitations of the test: Like CRP, the ESR is not specific to lupus. Because there are many causes for a positive result, including infection, the test is not diagnostic for lupus. Nor can it distinguish a lupus flare from an infection. Also, the level doesn't directly correlate with lupus disease activity. So it isn't necessarily useful for monitoring disease activity."
47,What are the uses and limitations of a chemistry panel for lupus?,"Chemistry Panel What it is: A chemistry panel is a test to assess kidney function and liver function. It also gives information on electrolytes, blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Why the test is used: Abnormalities may indicate the development of complications from lupus. They could also result from treatments for such conditions as kidney disease, elevated blood sugar levels, elevated cholesterol levels, and liver disease."
47,What are the uses and limitations of an anti-Ro(SSA) and anti-La(SSB) test for lupus?,"Anti- Ro( SSA) and Anti- La( SSB) What it is: Anti- Ro( SSA) and Anti- La( SSB) are two antibodies that are commonly found together. They are specific against ribonucleic acid ( RNA) proteins. Why the test is used: Anti- Ro is found in anywhere from 24% to 60% of lupus patients. It's also found in 70% of people with another autoimmune disorder called SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. Anti- La is found in 35% of people with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. For this reason, their presence may be useful in diagnosing one of these disorders. Both antibodies are associated with neonatal lupus, a rare but potentially serious problem in newborns. In pregnant women, a positive Anti- Ro( SSA) or Anti- La( SSB) warns doctors of the need to monitor the unborn baby. Limitations of the test: Like other antibodies, the fact that the test is not positive in many people with lupus means it can't be used to diagnose lupus. Also, it is more indicative of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome than of lupus."
47,What are the uses and limitations of an antiphospholipid antibodies test for lupus?,"Antiphospholipid Antibodies ( APLs) What it is: APLs are a type of antibody directed against phospholipids. Why the test is used: APLs are present in up to 60% of people with lupus. Their presence can help confirm a diagnosis. A positive test is also used to help identify women with lupus that have certain risks that require preventive treatment and monitoring. Those risks include blood clots, miscarriage, or preterm birth. Limitations of the test: APLs may also occur in people without lupus. Their presence alone is not enough for a lupus diagnosis."
47,What are the uses and limitations of an antinuclear antibody test for lupus?,"Antinuclear Antibody ( ANA) What it is: ANA is a type of antibody directed against the cells' nuclei. Why the test is used: ANA is present in nearly everybody with active lupus. Doctors often use the ANA test as a screening tool. Plus, looking at patterns of the antibodies can sometimes help doctors determine the specific disease a person has. That, in turn, helps determine which treatment would be most appropriate. Limitations of the test: Although almost all people with lupus have the antibody, a positive result doesn't necessarily indicate lupus. Positive results are often seen with some other diseases and in a smaller percentage of people without lupus or other autoimmune disorders. So a positive ANA by itself is not enough for a lupus diagnosis. Doctors must consider the result of this test along with other criteria."
47,What are the uses and limitations of a complete blood cell count for lupus?,"Complete Blood Cell Count ( CBC) What it is: CBC is a test to measure levels of different blood cells. Why the test is used: Abnormalities in blood cell counts, including white blood cells and red blood cells, may occur in people with lupus. This may be related to the lupus, lupus treatments, or infection. For example, leukopenia, a decrease in the number of white blood cells, is found in about 50% of people with lupus. Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, occurs in about 50% of people with lupus, as well. Doctors can use this test to monitor these potentially serious problems. Limitations of the test: Many other medical conditions can cause abnormalities in blood cell counts. So the test by itself is not specific to a lupus diagnosis."
47,What are the uses and limitations of an anti-Sm test for lupus?,"Anti- Sm What it is: Anti- Sm is an antibody directed against Sm, a specific protein found in the cell nucleus. Why the test is used: The protein is found in up to 30% of people with lupus. It's rarely found in people without lupus. So a positive test can help confirm a lupus diagnosis. Limitations of the test: Up to only 30% of people with lupus have a positive anti- Sm test. So relying on an anti- Sm result alone would miss a large majority of people with lupus."
47,What are the uses and limitations of an anti-dsDNA for lupus?,"Anti-ds DNA What it is: Anti-ds DNA is a protein directed against double-stranded DNA. DNA is the material that makes up the body's genetic code. Why the test is used: Between 75% and 90% of people with lupus have a positive anti-ds DNA test. Also, the test is very specific for lupus. Therefore, a positive test can be useful in confirming a diagnosis. For many people, the titer, or level, of the antibodies rises as the disease becomes more active. So, doctors can also use it to help measure disease activity. Also, the presence of anti-ds DNA indicates a greater risk of lupus nephritis, a kidney inflammation that occurs with lupus. So a positive test can alert doctors to the need to monitor the kidneys. Limitations of the test: Up to 25% of people with lupus have a negative test. So, a negative test doesn't mean a person doesn't have lupus."
47,What should you know about lab tests for lupus?,"However, when certain clinical criteria are met, lab tests can help confirm a diagnosis of lupus. Blood work and other tests can also help monitor the disease and show the effects of treatment. Positive results are often seen with some other diseases and in a smaller percentage of people without lupus or other autoimmune disorders. Limitations of the test: Like other antibodies, the fact that the test is not positive in many people with lupus means it can't be used to diagnose lupus."
47,Which urine tests are used for lupus?,"C- Reactive Protein ( CRP) What it is: CRP is a protein in the body that can be a marker of inflammation. Chemistry Panel What it is: A chemistry panel is a test to assess kidney function and liver function. Besides blood tests used to diagnose and monitor lupus, doctors use urine tests to diagnose and monitor the effects of lupus on the kidneys. These tests include the following: Urine Protein/ Microalbuminuria. Creatinine Clearance: This test measures how effective the kidneys are at filtering the blood to eliminate waste products. It is conducted on urine collected over a 24-hour period. Urinalysis: Urinalysis can be used in screening for kidney disease. The presence of protein, red blood cells, white blood cells, and cellular casts may all indicate kidney disease."
48,How can you manage blood sugar level in children?,"No one expects that they'll be perfect all the time. Your goal is simple: Get it into the target range when it isn't, because your child's body can't. Test his blood sugar several times a day so you'll know what you need to do to adjust it."
48,What causes young children's blood sugar levels to change?,"Food Exercise Growth Illness Stress and other emotions Medication Remember, the numbers on the meter aren't ""good"" or ""bad"" -- they're just numbers."
48,How can I best avoid too high or low blood sugar levels in young children?,"Testing is the best way to avoid dangerously high and low levels. You might not notice symptoms, and your child may not be able to explain what's happening. If he can't talk yet, he certainly can't tell you he feels funny. As your child gets older, his targets will change. Your doctor will help you figure out what levels are right for your child."
48,What causes your child's blood sugar levels to go up and down if they have diabetes?,"Food Exercise Growth Illness Stress and other emotions Medication Remember, the numbers on the meter aren't ""good"" or ""bad"" -- they're just numbers."
48,How can children's blood sugar levels change?,"No one expects that they'll be perfect all the time. Your goal is simple: Get it into the target range when it isn't, because your child's body can't. Test his blood sugar several times a day so you'll know what you need to do to adjust it."
48,How can your child with diabetes avoid dangerous blood sugar levels?,"Testing is the best way to avoid dangerously high and low levels. You might not notice symptoms, and your child may not be able to explain what's happening. Your doctor will help you figure out what levels are right for your child."
49,What should I ask my doctor about anxiety?,"Are there any underlying medical problems that could be causing my anxiety symptoms? Will I need to take an anxiety drug? Will I take it every day or as needed? How long will I need to take it? What side effects can I expect from medications? Is there a way to minimize or prevent side effects? What should I do if I miss a dose of medication? Should I begin therapy sessions? Which type and for how long? How long before I can expect to feel better? Once treated, how likely is it that my anxiety symptoms will return? What lifestyle changes can I make to help me feel better? How will alcohol or other drugs interact with my medication or affect my anxiety?"
50,What is the outlook for lymphedema?,"With proper care and treatment, your affected limb can be restored to a normal size and shape. The condition can usually be controlled so that it doesn't get worse. But remember, it's important to get your symptoms treated as soon as possible."
50,What are some recommendations to prevent lymphedema?,"It's a good idea to follow these tips, too: Avoid extreme temperature changes. Do not use hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas, or steam baths. Use warm, rather than hot, water when bathing or washing dishes. Always wear sun protection (at least SPF 30) when going outdoors. Talk to your doctor before traveling. When traveling by air, ask your doctor if you should wear a compression sleeve on your affected arm or a stocking on your affected leg. For long flights, additional bandages may be needed. When sitting or sleeping, elevate your affected arm or leg on pillows. Don't spend a lot of time lying on your affected side. Your doctor may refer you to an occupational therapist ( OT) who specializes in managing lymphedema. Your OT may have you do specific exercises, limit certain activities, and possibly recommend a compression sleeve or other devices."
50,What are some symptoms of lymphedema?,"Swelling in the arms, hands, fingers, shoulders, chest, or legs. A ""full"" or heavy sensation in the arms or legs Skin tightness Less flexibility in your hand, wrist, or ankle Trouble fitting into clothing in one specific area A tight-fitting bracelet, watch, or ring that wasn't tight before Your doctor will look into your medical history (including past surgeries and treatments) and your current medications and symptoms."
50,How is lymphedema diagnosed?,"A ""full"" or heavy sensation in the arms or legs Skin tightness Less flexibility in your hand, wrist, or ankle Trouble fitting into clothing in one specific area A tight-fitting bracelet, watch, or ring that wasn't tight before Your doctor will look into your medical history (including past surgeries and treatments) and your current medications and symptoms. She'll also give you a complete physical exam. She might ask you to take other tests, too, like an MRI, CT scan, or ultrasound to check for fluid build-up."
50,How can someone keep their skin clean to avoid lymphedema?,"Other treatments can include bandaging, proper skin care and diet, compression garments, exercises, and manual lymphatic drainage, a gentle form of skin stretching and massage."
50,What symptoms should the doctor know about to avoid lymphedema?,"Let her know if you have redness, swelling, a skin rash, or blistering on the side of your body where you had surgery, or if you have a temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F. These warning signs of infection could be an early sign of lymphedema and should be treated immediately."
50,How common is it for women to get lymphedema after breast cancer treatment?,"A small amount of swelling, even in your arm, is normal for the first 4 to 6 weeks after breast cancer surgery."
50,What foods should someone cut back on to reduce getting lymphedema?,"Get Good Nutrition Cut back on foods high in salt and fat. Have at least two to four servings of fruits and three to five servings of vegetables each day. Eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients you need. Use the package label information to make healthy choices. Get fiber from whole-grain versions of breads, cereals, pasta, and rice. Fruit and veggies are good sources too. Drink plenty of water. Stay at your ideal body weight. A registered dietitian or your doctor can calculate it. Limit alcoholic drinks."
50,Who is at risk for lymphedema?,"People who've had any of these procedures may be at risk: Simple mastectomy in combination with axillary (arm pit) lymph node removal Lumpectomy in combination with axillary lymph node removal Modified radical mastectomy in combination with axillary lymph node removal Combined cancer surgery and radiation therapy to a lymph node region (such as the neck, armpit, groin, pelvis, or abdomen) Radiation therapy to a lymph node region You can get lymphedema within a few days of surgery, but it can also happen months or years afterward. If untreated, it can become worse."
50,What is primary lymphedema?,Primary is rare. It happens when certain lymph vessels are missing or faulty at birth.
50,What is secondary lymphedema?,"The buildup of lymph, a fluid your body makes, happens when lymph vessels or nodes that the fluid travels through are missing, damaged, or removed. It can develop not only after breast cancer surgery, but can also come from an infection, scar tissue formation, trauma, deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a vein), radiation, or other cancer treatments."
51,How much ashwagandha should you take?,"Others mix 3 grams of ashwagandha powder in warm milk. There are also standardized extracts available. Ask your doctor for advice about forms of ashwagandha and doses. In some parts of the world, people eat ashwagandha shoots, seeds, and fruit."
51,What are risks of taking ashwagandha?,"Talk to a doctor before using ashwagandha if you have any health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, thyroid problems, bleeding disorders, ulcers, lupus, multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Ashwagandha might interfere with thyroid tests. Stop taking ashwagandha two weeks before surgery."
51,What are interactions of ashwagandha?,"If you take any drugs or supplements regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using ashwagandha supplements. They could interact with sedatives, blood thinners, thyroid supplements, drugs that suppress the immune system, and drugs for anxiety, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Ashwagandha might also interact with supplements that cause sleepiness, like St. John's wort, kava, valerian, and others."
51,Why do people take ashwagandha?,"However, the practical benefits and risks for people aren't clear yet. One study found that a compound containing ashwagandha helped relive osteoarthritis symptoms. It's not clear which of the ingredients had the benefit since ashwaganda is traditionally used in combination with other herbs. Ashwagandha might help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes and lower high cholesterol. Since ashwagandha has sedative effects, it could help ease anxiety and stress -- in fact, human studies have indicated as much."
51,What is ashwagandha?,"It is high in iron and has been shown to help increase hemoglobin levels. In some parts of the world, people eat ashwagandha shoots, seeds, and fruit."
52,What is Rett syndrome?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Rett syndrome is a rare, severe neurological disorder that affects mostly girls. It's usually discovered in the first two years of life, and a child's diagnosis with Rett syndrome can feel overwhelming. Although there's no cure, early identification and treatment may help girls and families who are affected by Rett syndrome. In the past, it was felt to be part of the Autism Spectrum Disorder. We now know that it is mostly genetically based."
52,How effective are treatments for Rett syndrome?,"The best options available to treat Rett syndrome include: Standard medical care and medication Physical therapy Speech therapy Occupational therapy Good nutrition Behavioral therapy Supportive services Experts believe that therapy can help girls with Rett syndrome and their parents. Some girls may be able to go to school and learn better social interaction. Medicines can treat some of the problems with movement in Rett syndrome. Medication can also help control seizures. Many girls with Rett syndrome can live at least into middle age. Researchers are studying women with the disease, which was only widely recognized in the last 20 years."
52,What causes Rett syndrome?,"Most children with Rett syndrome have a mutation on the X chromosome. Exactly what this gene does, or how its mutation leads to Rett syndrome, isn't clear. Researchers believe that the single gene may influence many other genes involved in development. Although Rett syndrome is genetic, children almost never inherit the faulty gene from their parents. Rather, it's a chance mutation that happens in DNA. When boys develop the Rett syndrome mutation, they rarely live past birth. Males have only one X chromosome (instead of the two girls have), so the effects of the disease are much more serious, and almost always fatal."
52,How does Rett syndrome develop?,"The age when symptoms appear varies, but most babies with Rett syndrome seem to grow normally for the first 6 months before any signs of the disorder are obvious. The most common changes usually show up when babies are between 12 and 18 months, and they can be sudden or progress slowly."
53,How does surgery work to treat hypospadias?,"There are three kinds, depending on where the urethra opening is located: Near the head of the penis (subcoronal) Along the shaft of the penis (midshaft) Where the penis and scrotum meet, or on the scrotum (penoscrotal) If the location of the opening is near the tip, the penis often works well enough to leave it alone. But many cases of hypospadias call for surgery to move the urethra and opening. This procedure often includes straightening the penis. The goal of surgical correction is to create a penis with normal function and appearance with a urethral opening as close as possible to the ventral tip of the penis."
53,What are the types of hypospadias?,"There are three kinds, depending on where the urethra opening is located: Near the head of the penis (subcoronal) Along the shaft of the penis (midshaft) Where the penis and scrotum meet, or on the scrotum (penoscrotal) If the location of the opening is near the tip, the penis often works well enough to leave it alone."
53,What complication's can hypospadias cause?,"But boys with hypospadias are born with the location of the opening ranging anywhere within the head or shaft of penis, the scrotum, or perineum Hypospadias is pretty common and can sometimes be left as is. Depending on where the opening is on your son's penis, he cmight have problems having children because his sperm might not be able to effectively fertilize an egg. Keeping it clean may be hard, too. If his hypospadias isn't corrected early, a boy may have to sit down when he pees. There are three kinds, depending on where the urethra opening is located: Near the head of the penis (subcoronal) Along the shaft of the penis (midshaft) Where the penis and scrotum meet, or on the scrotum (penoscrotal) If the location of the opening is near the tip, the penis often works well enough to leave it alone."
53,What is the procedure for surgery to treat hypospadias?,"But doctors can do surgery to fix the problem when needed. There are three kinds, depending on where the urethra opening is located: Near the head of the penis (subcoronal) Along the shaft of the penis (midshaft) Where the penis and scrotum meet, or on the scrotum (penoscrotal) If the location of the opening is near the tip, the penis often works well enough to leave it alone. Children who get this surgery are usually between 3 months and 18 months old. The child is anesthetized -- not awake -- during the surgery."
53,What causes hypospadias?,"They think some of the reasons could be: Genetics. It's more likely if the boy has a father or brother who were born with it. Fertility treatments. The mother may have used hormone therapy or medicine to help her get pregnant.. There's more chance a baby will be born with hypospadia if his mom is overweight and over age 35, has diabetes prior to her pregnancy Expsoure to smoking or pesticides Premature You can reduce your baby's chances of hypospadias while you're pregnant. There are three kinds, depending on where the urethra opening is located: Near the head of the penis (subcoronal) Along the shaft of the penis (midshaft) Where the penis and scrotum meet, or on the scrotum (penoscrotal) If the location of the opening is near the tip, the penis often works well enough to leave it alone."
54,How does progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) work?,"Here is how it works; While inhaling, contract one muscle group (for example your upper thighs) for 5 seconds to 10 seconds, then exhale and suddenly release the tension in that muscle group. Give yourself 10 seconds to 20 seconds to relax, and then move on to the next muscle group (for example your buttocks). While releasing the tension, try to focus on the changes you feel when the muscle group is relaxed. Imagery may be helpful in conjunction with the release of tension, such as imagining that stressful feelings are flowing out of your body as you relax each muscle group. Gradually work your way up the body contracting and relaxing muscle groups."
54,Who first came up with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)?,The technique of progressive muscle relaxation was described by Edmund Jacobson in the 1930s and is based upon his premise that mental calmness is a natural result of physical relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation can be learned by nearly anyone and requires only 10 minutes to 20 minutes per day to practice.
54,What is progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) for stress and insomnia?,"Progressive muscle relaxation is based upon the simple practice of tensing, or tightening, one muscle group at a time followed by a relaxation phase with release of the tension. Doctors have used progressive muscle relaxation in combination with standard treatments for symptom relief in a number of conditions, including headaches, cancer pain, high blood pressure, and digestive disturbances."
54,What do practitioners recommend when doing progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)?,"Progressive muscle relaxation is based upon the simple practice of tensing, or tightening, one muscle group at a time followed by a relaxation phase with release of the tension. You can practice this technique seated or lying down, and you should try to practice with comfortable clothing on, and in a quiet place free of all distractions."
55,What are the side effects of the Td vaccine?,"Mild side effects of Tdap may include: Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given Mild fever Headache Tiredness Stomach upset, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Muscle aches and pains Swollen glands Mild side effects of Td may include: Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given Mild fever Headache In some people, these side effects may be more intense. They may temporarily interfere with daily activities. Severe swelling of the arm has been reported in three out of 100 people receiving either Tdap or Td. About one in 250 adults who receive the Tdap vaccine develop a fever of 102 F or higher."
55,What is tetanus?,"Tetanus enters the body through a wound or cut. It affects the brain and nervous system and causes extremely painful muscle spasms. Spasms of the jaw can make it impossible for you to open your mouth. This condition is often called ""lockjaw."" Tetanus kills one out of five people infected with the disease."
55,What is pertussis?,"Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an extremely contagious respiratory infection that can lead to severe breathing problems, especially in infants. Pertussis first appears like an ordinary cold, but then causes intense, uncontrollable coughing spells. A ""whoop"" noise is heard when the person tries to take a breath after coughing."
55,What is Tdap and Td vaccine?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Tdap is a combination vaccine that protects against three potentially life-threatening bacterial diseases: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Td is a booster vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria. It does not protect against pertussis."
55,Who needs a Tdap vaccine?,"Tdap is given only once during your lifetime. However, you may need routine booster shots of the Td vaccine every 10 years to adequately protect you against tetanus and diphtheria."
55,What has been found in clinical trials of the Tdap vaccine?,"During clinical trials of Tdap, two adults developed temporary nervous system problems. It's unknown whether this was due to the vaccine or not. In rare cases, vaccination with Tdap or Td has led to extreme swelling of the arm where the shot was given."
55,What are the mild side effects of Tdap vaccine?,"Mild side effects of Tdap may include: Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given Mild fever Headache Tiredness Stomach upset, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Muscle aches and pains Swollen glands Mild side effects of Td may include: Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given Mild fever Headache In some people, these side effects may be more intense."
55,What is diphtheria?,"Diphtheria is a very contagious infection that makes it difficult to breathe. In severe cases, it can cause heart and nerve damage."
55,When should I get the Tdap vaccine?,"New mothers who have never received the Tdap People who travel to countries where pertussis is common You may be given the Tdap vaccine if you have a severe cut or burn and have never received a dose before. Severe cuts or burns raise your risk for tetanus. The Tdap vaccine can be given any time of the year. Only one shot is needed. It may be given with other vaccinations. Tdap can be given regardless of the interval since the last Td vaccine was given. The Tdap vaccine can be used safely for those ages 65 and over, according to 2013 CDC recommendations."
55,Who should not get the vaccine?,"You should not receive the vaccine if you have had: A serious allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients in the past A coma or seizures within a week of receiving childhood vaccinations for pertussis (such as DTa P), unless the vaccine was not the cause; Td can be used in these cases."
55,When should adults be vaccinated with Tdap?,New mothers who have never received the Tdap People who travel to countries where pertussis is common You may be given the Tdap vaccine if you have a severe cut or burn and have never received a dose before.
55,What are the side effects and risks of Tdap and Td vaccine?,"Like all medicines, vaccines can have side effects. However, the chance of a life-threatening reaction is small. The CDC says the dangers of developing pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria far outweigh the risks of vaccination."
55,When should I talk to my doctor about getting Tdap vaccine?,"If you have had any of the following, talk to your doctor about whether the Tdap or Td vaccine is right for you: Epilepsy or another nervous system problem Guillain- BarrÃ© syndrome ( GBS) A history of severe swelling or pain after receiving a pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria vaccination in the past If you are moderately to severely ill (your doctor may recommend waiting to get the shot until after you recover); the CDC says you can still get the vaccine if you have a mild illness such as a cold or low-grade fever."
55,What should I know about Tdap vaccination?,"Td is a booster vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria. Tdap stands for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids with acellular pertussis. It is marketed under the brand names Adacel and Boostrix. Tdap is an inactive vaccine, which means it is made using dead bacteria. The dead germs cannot make you sick. Tdap is not the same as DTa P, the vaccine used for children to prevent the same diseases."
55,Can adults have allergic reactions to Tdap or Td vaccines?,"You should not receive the vaccine if you have had: A serious allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients in the past A coma or seizures within a week of receiving childhood vaccinations for pertussis (such as DTa P), unless the vaccine was not the cause; Td can be used in these cases. This generally happens in less than one in a million doses. Most of the time, such reactions occur within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine. The following can be signs of a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis: Behavior changes Breathing difficulty, including wheezing Dizziness Hoarse voice High fever Hives Pale skin Rapid heart beat Weakness Seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these signs after receiving the Tdap or Td vaccines."
55,How common is pertussis?,Waning immunity and inadequate vaccination -- many parents choose not to vaccinate their children -- have led to a resurgence of the disease in the U. S. in recent years. Outbreaks of pertussis among adolescents and adults have been reported in several states. Only one shot is needed.
56,What is a slit-lamp test to help diagnose eye stroke?,You sit in front of a special microscope. It shines a narrow line of light in your eye so your doctor can look for anything unusual.
56,What happens when you get fluorescein angiography to help find out if you had an eye stroke?,Your doctor injects a harmless dye in your arm. It moves through your bloodstream to your retina. A special camera takes pictures of your eye to show which blood vessels are blocked.
56,What is a visual field test if you might have had an eye stroke?,"You look into a machine and click a button each time you see a light. It checks if you lost any peripheral vision, which is what you see out the sides of your eyes."
56,How is eye stroke treated?,"Minutes count in order to save your vision after an eye stroke. You may avoid lasting injury if doctors can clear the central artery blockage and restore blood flows within 90-100 minutes. But after 4 hours, the blockage could damage your vision for good."
56,What type of eye stroke is central retinal occlusion?,"You may notice: Loss of all or part of your sight Not able to see out of side of your eyes Blurry or distorted vision Blind spots The most common type of eye stroke is called central retinal artery occlusion. It can leave you with little useful vision. You might be able to see a hand move, but not much more. Rarely, your vision might return on its own. If you have the less serious blockage in the smaller arteries, your vision may go back to normal about 80% of the time."
56,How can optical coherence tomography help in the diagnosis of eye stroke?,"You get drops to dilate your pupils. Then a machine scans your eyes to make a detailed image of the retina. If your doctor thinks a clot from another part of the body caused the blockage, she may suggest other tests to look for problems in your arteries and heart. She also may order blood tests to check for clotting disorders and your cholesterol levels."
56,How can paracentesis help treat eye stroke?,"A specialist uses a small needle to remove a few drops of fluid from the front of your eye. This reduces pressure, which may increase blood flow in the retina."
56,What are symptoms of eye stroke?,"Other things that make a retinal artery occlusion more likely include: Being 40 or older Being a man Smoking Trauma to the eye Damage from radiation treatments Kidney disease Clotting disorders such as sickle cell disease Birth control pills Carotid artery disease Abnormal heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation Vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessel wall Pregnancy The main sign of eye stroke is a sudden change in sight. It almost always happens in only one eye. You usually won't feel any pain. You may notice: Loss of all or part of your sight Not able to see out of side of your eyes Blurry or distorted vision Blind spots The most common type of eye stroke is called central retinal artery occlusion."
56,How can medications help with treating eye stroke?,"You may get drugs to bust clots or to lower the pressure in your eyes. These include drugs used for glaucoma, like acetazolamide ( Diamox)."
56,How can eye massage help with treating eye stroke?,Your doctor may try one or more of the following treatments: Eye massage. Your doctor will massage your closed eyelid with a finger to dislodge the clot.
56,Can you prevent eye stroke?,"You usually get an eye stroke because of another medical issue, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. So keep your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels in check. If you have diabetes, get your eyes checked every year."
56,What makes eye stroke more likely?,"If you have a condition that affects the blood vessels -- including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease -- it can raise your chances of an eye stroke."
56,What is carbon-dioxide-oxygen to help treat eye stroke?,You breathe in a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen to increase blood flow to the retina. It also widens the arteries.
56,How is eye stroke diagnosed?,She may ask you to read an eye chart. She'll also put drops in your eyes to open up your pupils and use an ophthalmoscope to check your retina for any blockages or bleeding. Your doctor will massage your closed eyelid with a finger to dislodge the clot.
56,Can you have a stroke in your eye?,"It can cause blurry vision and even blindness. Arteries carry blood to the retina from the heart. Without blood flow, the cells in the retina don't get enough oxygen. They can start to die within minutes or hours. An eye stroke is an emergency. If you don't get treated right away, you can damage your vision permanently. This reduces pressure, which may increase blood flow in the retina."
57,What can you do to prevent migraine headaches from alcohol?,"You can also try to: Have alcohol with a meal. This may lower the chance of bringing on a migraine. Don't drink when you're stressed. It's linked to a higher number of migraine headaches. Skip home hangover remedies. There's no proof that drinking raw eggs or downing hot sauce will get rid of your morning-after migraine faster. Downing more alcohol (the âhair of the dogâ theory) won't help either. Try triptans. Ask your doctor if this medicine might help. It can't prevent a migraine, but it can help stop one after it starts. Triptans work best when you take them at the early signs of a migraine. Still, they can cause serious health risks for many people."
57,What can trigger migraine headaches?,"Many things can trigger a migraine, from stress at work to changes in the weather and foods like aged cheese. And for about one-third of people who have these headaches, alcohol is also a trigger."

57,What are symptoms of migraine triggered by alcohol?,"Alcohol can cause two different types of migraine headaches. You could get a headache within 30 minutes to 3 hours of drinking. You don't have to chug a large amount for this to happen. Some people only sip a glass or two of wine before their head starts to throb. Or you might be fine until after your blood alcohol level returns to normal. This is called a delayed alcohol-induced headache ( DAIH). It may not show up until the morning after you drink. This type of headache can happen to anyone, but people with migraines are more likely to get one. It can happen even if you drink less than people who don't get migraine headaches."
57,What are the symptoms of a migraine headache caused by alcohol?,"But if you're prone to migraine headaches, drinking even a small amount of alcohol can bring on an attack. You could get a headache within 30 minutes to 3 hours of drinking. You don't have to chug a large amount for this to happen. Some people only sip a glass or two of wine before their head starts to throb. Or you might be fine until after your blood alcohol level returns to normal.

57,Does alcohol trigger migraine headaches?,Drinking a small amount of alcohol may be good for you. This may lower the chance of bringing on a migraine.
57,How can you tell if alcohol triggers your migraine headaches?,"Alcohol can cause two different types of migraine headaches. Each time you drink, write down the type of alcohol you have, the amount, and if and when you had a migraine. Include how you felt the prior 48 hours as well as any stress or anxiety you were under at the time. Over time, you should be able to see a pattern. A migraine each time you have a night out should be good reason to abstain. You can also try to: Have alcohol with a meal."
57,What chemical in alcohol can trigger migraine?,"And for about one-third of people who have these headaches, alcohol is also a trigger. Once it gets into your system, it is converted into a chemical that triggers migraine. Ethanol is also a natural diuretic. That means it makes you pee more than normal. All of these things can set you up for a migraine. You might have heard that red wine is most likely to cause problems. But other drinks like sparkling wine, beer, and hard liquor may be just as likely, if not more, to cause problems."
57,How can alcohol trigger a migraine?,"But if you're prone to migraine headaches, drinking even a small amount of alcohol can bring on an attack. And for about one-third of people who have these headaches, alcohol is also a trigger. Many things are probably at play. For instance, alcohol byproducts called congeners have been linked to headaches. Dark-colored alcohols like red wine, brandy, and whiskey may contain more of them. Once it gets into your system, it is converted into a chemical that triggers migraine."
58,What are the cons of gastric banding surgery?,The Cons: Your weight loss may be less dramatic than with gastric bypass. The average loss is 40% to 50% of your excess weight -- although not in everybody. You may regain some of the weight over the years. This type of surgery has a higher rate of re-operation.
58,How much weight will I lose after gastric banding or bypass surgery?,"Blood clots in the legs, called deep vein thrombosis, or DVT Pneumonia After gastric bypass surgery, most people can expect to lose between 66% and 80% of their extra body weight. Most of this is lost within the first two years. After gastric banding, people lose 40% to 50% of their extra weight, typically within the first two years after the surgery."
58,What are complications that may develop from weight loss surgery?,"Complications that may develop following weight loss surgery include: Hernia Gallstones Ulcerations Gastric prolapse Severe scarring of the new stomach pouch Excess skin that may need to be removed in an additional surgery Dehydration Hair loss Kidney stones Hypoglycemia Rare but serious complications include: Bleeding in the stool, or black stools Leaks in new connections made by weight loss surgery; these usually occur within five days of surgery."
58,What are rare but serious complications that may develop from weight loss surgery?,"Complications that may develop following weight loss surgery include: Hernia Gallstones Ulcerations Gastric prolapse Severe scarring of the new stomach pouch Excess skin that may need to be removed in an additional surgery Dehydration Hair loss Kidney stones Hypoglycemia Rare but serious complications include: Bleeding in the stool, or black stools Leaks in new connections made by weight loss surgery; these usually occur within five days of surgery. Blood clots in the lungs, called pulmonary emboli, rarely occur, but if they do, they are the most common cause of death after weight loss surgery. Blood clots can be usually prevented with blood thinning medicines and frequent activity. Blood clots in the legs, called deep vein thrombosis, or DVT Pneumonia After gastric bypass surgery, most people can expect to lose between 66% and 80% of their extra body weight."
58,When should I decide to get weight loss surgery?,Don't rush into weight loss surgery. Talk to family and friends. Talk to surgeons and to people at the hospital centers. Prepare yourself mentally and physically. Make sure you are committed to changing your lifestyle and to keeping the weight off forever.
58,What are the pros of gastric bypass surgery?,"Gastric Bypass Surgery The Pros: Weight loss is quick and dramatic. People lose an average of 60% to 80% of their excess body weight. Because weight loss is quick, weight-related health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis, sleep apnea, and heartburn improve quickly. Most people are able to keep at least 50% of the excess weight off long term. Loss of stomach tissue results in a drop in the so-called ""hunger hormone"" (ghrelin), which helps control appetite."
58,Who should consider having weight loss surgery?,"Weight loss surgery is not for everyone. Doctors generally recommend it only for people who: Have a body mass index ( BMI) of 40 or more -- about 100 pounds overweight for men and 80 for women Have a lower BMI (35 to 40), but also have serious health problems related to obesity such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or severe sleep apnea Have tried and failed to lose weight by nonsurgical means such as diet and exercise Fully understand the risks associated with weight loss surgery and are motivated There are two basic types of weight loss surgery -- restrictive surgeries and malabsorptive surgeries."
58,Can you regain weight after weight loss surgery?,"Some eat high-calorie or high-fat foods instead of healthy foods -- and eat them too often. Some people rely on ""soft meals"" such as ice cream and milk shakes. The body itself may change over time, too, leading to weight gain. The digestive tract might begin absorbing more calories. Even the size of your surgical stomach can expand gradually over time."
58,What is the cost of weight loss surgery and will insurance cover it?,"A typical weight loss surgery can run from $15,000 to $25,000 -- so insurance coverage is critical for most people. Every insurance company is different, but before agreeing to cover the surgery, most insurance companies want documentation of the patient's struggle with obesity. They want a primary care doctor's records indicating that the patient has tried to lose weight through diet, exercise, and psychological counseling. Also, medical causes of obesity must be ruled out. It pays to ensure that your doctor documents your efforts early on, so surgery is an option later."
58,What are questions to consider when choosing a bariatric surgeon?,Here are some questions to consider when choosing a bariatric surgeon: Is the specialist board certified by the American Board of Surgery? Is the specialist a member of the American Society of Bariatric Surgeons? How many weight loss surgeries has the surgeon performed? (100 or more is ideal.) How many of the surgeon's patients have died from weight loss surgery? ( Less than 1% is the average.) How often do patients have complications? What side effects are most common? What is the surgeon's success rate?
58,Will I feel like myself after I lose weight?,"You may feel odd, not quite like yourself. You may feel overwhelmed by the lifestyle changes you must make for the rest of your life. You may have reached for food as comfort -- and have difficulty giving it up. A therapist can help you get through this complicated period. A support group can also help. Ask your doctor about support groups for people who have had weight loss surgery. It helps to meet people who are making the same adjustments you're making -- and can help keep you on track with your weight loss program."
58,Are there educational seminars for people considering weight loss surgery?,"Check into centers and hospitals offering educational seminars for people considering weight loss surgery. You can learn more about the actual procedure, the benefits and the risks. You may also get names of specialists who perform these surgeries. Go to these seminars and ask questions."
58,What are the cons of gastric bypass surgery?,"The Cons: Your weight loss may be less dramatic than with gastric bypass. The surgery may result in vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The surgery may result in dumping syndrome, which occurs when food moves too quickly through the stomach and intestines. Dumping syndrome can cause shaking, sweating, dizziness, nausea, and severe diarrhea. Gastric bypass is generally considered irreversible. The surgery permanently changes how your body digests food."
58,How can you make nutrition a priority after weight loss surgery?,"Should this occur, additional surgery may be necessary. You must make the foods you eat count. You must also take the right supplements, as recommended by your health care provider, because serious malnutrition occurs easily following weight loss surgery. A dietitian can create a diet and nutrition plan designed to meet your needs."
58,What are malabsorptive surgeries for weight loss?,"Restrictive surgeries (like adjustable gastric banding) work by physically restricting the stomach's size, limiting the amount of solid food you can eat. The surgeon removes parts of your intestine, creating a shortcut for the food to be digested. This means that fewer calories get absorbed into the body. The combined malabsorptive/restrictive surgery also creates a smaller stomach pouch, which restricts the amount of food you can eat."
58,How should you eat after weight loss surgery?,"Most people are able to keep at least 50% of the excess weight off long term. Eat small amounts of food slowly, chew well, and eat lots of protein."
58,How will my physical appearance change after weight loss surgery?,"However, many people who lose a lot of weight often find their skin looks loose and baggy. You may want plastic surgery to remove this excess skin. People will notice, and ask you about your appearance."
58,What are restrictive surgeries for weight loss?,"After weight loss surgery, a stomach may only hold one ounce of food, although over time it may be able to hold two or three ounces of food. The combined malabsorptive/restrictive surgery also creates a smaller stomach pouch, which restricts the amount of food you can eat."
58,Will my social life and relationships change after weight loss surgery?,"For many people, food and drink are the basis for socializing. After weight loss surgery, you must find other ways to socialize -- ways that aren't focused on food. Also, as you lose weight, the results will be obvious. People will notice, and ask you about your appearance. Prepare for these questions ahead of time -- and consider how you want to answer them. Talk to family and friends."
58,What are the pros of gastric banding surgery?,"Gastric Banding Surgery The Pros: Gastric banding is often a minimally invasive surgery performed with small incisions, a laparoscope (a tiny camera), and special instruments. There is no need to cut into the stomach or intestine, and recovery is usually faster than with gastric bypass surgery. The surgery can be reversed by surgically removing the band. The band can be tightened or loosened in the doctor's office to control weight loss and nutritional needs. Serious complications are uncommon. But gastric bands can slip out of place, become too loose, or leak. Should this occur, additional surgery may be necessary."
58,How does weight loss surgery affect overall health?,"Because weight loss is quick, weight-related health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis, sleep apnea, and heartburn improve quickly. These include: Obstructive sleep apnea Type 2 diabetes Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) High cholesterol Degenerative joint disease or orthopedic problems High blood pressure Asthma Urinary incontinence After weight loss surgery, the body has difficulty absorbing certain important nutrients, including: Iron Vitamin B-12 Folate Calcium Vitamin D However, taking a daily multivitamin, plus other supplements, can prevent or reduce these deficiencies."

74,Is hyperhidrosis serious?,"Focal hyperhidrosis isn't medically serious. Other forms of excessive sweating, though, can signal underlying medical problems. Sweating all over the body at once is called generalized hyperhidrosis. It's frequently caused by diseases affecting the whole body. Infections, hormone problems, cancer, or nerve problems can be responsible. It often occurs during sleep, unlike focal hyperhidrosis, which occurs only when awake. Anyone with all-over body sweating should see a doctor as soon as possible."
74,Can hyperhidrosis treatment help?,"Despite the serious negative impact hyperhidrosis has on the lives of those who suffer from it, most never seek treatment. Generally, people with focal hyperhidrosis have been living with their problem since they were young. After learning to live with excessive sweating, they often don't recognize their problem is treatable. That's too bad, because effective hyperhidrosis treatments are available. Although no treatment is perfect, hyperhidrosis medications and procedures can help many people with the condition."
74,How does hyperhidrosis begin?,"Sweating is worst in the palms, soles, or underarms. When excessive sweating is limited to these areas, it's called focal hyperhidrosis. Most people with focal hyperhidrosis are otherwise completely healthy. Studies suggest that they are no more nervous or easily upset than people who sweat normally."
74,Which doctors can help with hyperhidrosis?,"Dermatologists are generally the best doctors for treating excessive sweating that's not controlled by OTC products.

78,What is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"It is a rare condition of irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia. The heart has an electrical system that works a certain way. Signals travel in an exact pattern from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. This system keeps the heart beating regularly. People with Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome have an extra electrical pathway. It causes the abnormal heartbeats. And it could lead to a very serious arrhythmia called supraventricular tachycardia.

79,What is the difference between heart failure and a heart attack?,"They have some common causes. But they also differ in key ways. Most heart attacks happen suddenly when one of the arteries leading to the heart becomes blocked and cuts off the blood flow. Without oxygen, the heart muscles start to die. Heart failure, on the other hand, usually develops gradually. The heart muscle becomes weaker and has trouble pumping blood to nourish the cells in your body. This is a chronic condition that gradually gets worse. But medications can help you live longer and better with it. Heart attacks can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart's pumping ability. Sometimes, heart failure comes on suddenly after a heart attack. Usually the symptoms are severe at first. This is called acute heart failure. But you can get better quickly with treatment and medication. Coronary artery disease is at the root of both heart attack and heart failure."
79,How can you treat heart attacks?,"If you have heart failure, you'll likely notice more than one of these classic symptoms: Shortness of breath (especially when lying down) Wheezing or coughing Fast or irregular heartbeat Tiredness Swelling around your ankles, legs, or stomach and weight gain from retaining fluid Confusion Heart attacks need to be treated right away. Call 911 even if you only suspect you're having one. Paramedics will probably give you blood-thinning aspirin to prevent any more clots and nitroglycerin to help blood flow. Your long-term treatment will depend on the cause, but many people recover well from a heart attack. You may need a procedure to open the blocked artery. With percutaneous coronary intervention, a surgeon threads a tube into the blocked artery. Then she expands a tiny balloon attached to the end of the tube to open the artery. At the same time, she may put a tiny mesh tube called a stent in to keep the artery propped open. Your doctor could suggest coronary artery bypass grafting. The surgeon takes out a healthy blood vessel and attaches it to the damaged vessel to create a detour for the blood. Your doctor will probably prescribe some long-term medications. They include drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. She may also suggest you learn how to manage your underlying heart disease through diet and exercise."

88,What are sulfonylureas?,Sulfonylureas: Pills or capsules that people take to lower the level of sugar in the blood; these oral diabetic medications work to lower your blood sugar by making your pancreas produce more insulin.
88,What does insulin-dependent diabetes mean?,Insulin-dependent diabetes: Former term used for type 1 diabetes.
88,What is short-acting insulin?,"Short-acting Insulin: Covers insulin needs for meals eaten within 30-60 minutes; includes humulin or novolin, or Velosulin (in an insulin pump)."
88,What is an Alpha cell?,"Alpha cell: A type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans; alpha cells make and release a hormone called ""glucagon."" Glucagon functions in direct opposition to insulin -- it increases the amount of glucose in the blood by releasing stored sugar from the liver."
88,What is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE)?,Certified Diabetes Educator ( CDE): A health care professional who is certified by the American Association of Diabetes Educators ( AADE) to teach people with diabetes how to manage their condition.
88,What is an emergency medical identification?,"Emergency medical identification: Cards, bracelets, or necklaces with a written message, used by people with diabetes or other medical problems to alert others in case of a medical emergency, such as coma."
88,What is the dawn phenomenon?,Dawn phenomenon: A rise in blood sugar levels in the early morning hours.
88,What is urine testing?,"Urine testing: Checking urine to see if it contains ketones; if you have type 1 diabetes, are pregnant and have diabetes, or have gestational diabetes, your doctor may ask you to check your urine for ketones. This is an easy test done at home with a dipstick measure."
88,What does a mixed dose mean for diabetics?,Mixed dose: A prescribed dose of insulin in which two types of insulin are combined and injected at once; a mixed dose commonly combines a fast-acting and longer-acting insulin. A mixed dose can either come in a pre-mixed syringe or mixed at the time of injection. A mixed dose may be prescribed to provide better blood sugar control.
88,What does gangrene mean?,"Gangrene: The death of body tissues, usually due to a lack of blood supply, especially in the legs and feet."
88,What is a jet injector for diabetes?,Jet injector: A device that uses high pressure to push insulin through the skin and into the tissue.
88,What is a calorie?,Calorie: Energy that comes from food; some foods have more calories than others. Fats have more calories than proteins and carbohydrate.
88,What is a glycated hemoglobin test (HbA1c)?,"Glycated hemoglobin test ( Hb A1c): This is an important blood test to determine how well you are managing your diabetes; hemoglobin is a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues. It can also attach to sugar in the blood, forming a substance called glycated hemoglobin or a Hemoglobin A1 C. The test provides an average blood sugar measurement over a 6- to 12-week period and is used in conjunction with home glucose monitoring to make treatment adjustments. The ideal range for people with diabetes is generally less than 7%. This test can also be used to diagnose diabetes when the Hb A1c level is equal to or greater than 6.5%."
88,What is protein?,"Protein: One of three main classes of food; proteins are made of amino acids, which are called the ""building blocks of the cells."" Cells need protein to grow and to mend themselves. Protein is found in many foods, like meat, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes, and dairy products."
88,What is an urologist?,"Urologist: A doctor who specializes in treatment of the urinary tract for men and women, as well as treatment of the genital organs for males."
88,What is a lipid?,"Lipid: Another term for a fat or fat-like substance in the blood; the body stores fat as energy for future use, just like a car that has a reserve fuel tank. When the body needs energy, it can break down lipids into fatty acids and burn them like glucose. Excess amounts of fats in the diet can cause fat buildup in the walls of the arteries -- called ""atherosclerosis."" Excess amounts of calories from fats or other nutrients can lead to an increase in weight gain."
88,What is blood glucose monitoring or testing?,"Blood glucose monitoring or testing: A method of testing how much sugar is in your blood; home blood-glucose monitoring involves pricking your finger with a lancing device, putting a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting the test strip into a blood-glucose-testing meter that displays your blood glucose level. Blood-sugar testing can also be done in the laboratory. Blood-glucose monitoring is recommended three or four times a day for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Depending on the situation, glucose checks before meals, two hours after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of the night, and before and after exercise, may be recommended. Home blood glucose monitoring: A way in which a person can test how much sugar is in the blood; also called ""self-monitoring of blood glucose."""
88,What is an antidiabetic agent?,"Antidiabetic agent: A substance that helps people with diabetes control the level of sugar in their blood (see insulin, oral diabetes medication). Oral diabetes medications: Medications that people take to lower the level of sugar in the blood; oral diabetes medications are prescribed for people whose pancreas still produces some insulin."
88,What is albuminuria?,"Albuminuria: When kidneys become damaged, they start to leak protein in the urine. Albumin is a small, abundant protein in the blood that passes through the kidney filter into the urine easier than other proteins. Albuminuria occurs in about 30%-45% of people who have had type 1 diabetes for at least 10 years. In people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the kidneys may already show signs of small amounts of protein spillage, called ""microalbuminuria."" This may be from the result of diabetes or from other diseases seen in conjunction with diabetes, like high blood pressure. Protein in the urine increases the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease. It also means that the person is at a particularly high risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. These lumps or indentations are called ""lipodystrophies."""
88,What is peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"People who have had diabetes for a long time may develop nephropathy. Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD): An abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart, usually the hands and feet; often occurs as a result of decreased blood flow and narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis; people who have had diabetes for a long time may develop PVD."
88,What is home blood glucose monitoring?,"Home blood glucose monitoring: A way in which a person can test how much sugar is in the blood; also called ""self-monitoring of blood glucose."" Home glucose monitoring tests whole blood (plasma and blood cell components); thus, the results can be different from lab values, which test plasma values of glucose. Typically, the lab plasma values can be higher than the glucose checks done at home with a glucose monitor. Self-blood glucose monitoring: See home blood glucose monitoring."
88,What is peripheral vascular disease?,"People who have had diabetes for a long time may develop nephropathy. Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD): An abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart, usually the hands and feet; often occurs as a result of decreased blood flow and narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis; people who have had diabetes for a long time may develop PVD."
88,What is a lancet?,"Lancet: A fine, sharp pointed needle for pricking the skin; used in blood sugar monitoring. Self-blood glucose monitoring: See home blood glucose monitoring."
88,What is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?,"Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA): A severe, life-threatening condition that results from hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), dehydration, and acid buildup that needs emergency fluid and insulin treatment; DKA happens when there is not enough insulin and cells become starved for sugars. An alternative source of energy called ketones becomes activated. A large amount of ketones in your system can lead to a serious condition called ketoacidosis."
88,What is a glucose tolerance test?,"Fasting plasma glucose test ( FPG): The preferred method of screening for diabetes; the FPG measures a person's blood sugar level after fasting or not eating anything for at least 8 hours. Glucose tolerance test: A test to determine if a person has diabetes; the test is done in a lab or doctor's office in the morning before the person has eaten. First, a sample of blood is taken in the fasting state. Then the person drinks a liquid that has sugar in it. Two hours later, a second blood test is done. A fasting blood sugar equal to or greater than 126 mg/dl is considered diabetes. If the two-hour test result shows a blood sugar equal to or greater than 200 mg/dl, the person is considered to have diabetes. A two-hour blood glucose between 140 mg/dl and 199 mg/dl is classified as impaired glucose tolerance."
88,What is type 2 diabetes?,"Diabetes: See type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes: A type of diabetes in which the insulin produced is either not enough or the person's body does not respond normally to the amount present; therefore, glucose in the blood cannot get into the body's cells for use as energy. This results in an increase in the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood."
89,What are focal seizures?,"Focal seizures are different. They're less intense and usually last no more than a minute or two. Part of their body, like an arm, might get stiff or go floppy. You may see repeated, rhythmic, or jerking movements in one place or that spread to different body parts. The person could zone out or stare at nothing. They may or may not realize what's happening but can't control it. When it's over, they won't remember a thing."
89,When should you call 911 for someone having a seizure?,"Get medical help when: It's a child's first seizure. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. Another seizure begins soon after the first. The person doesn't ""wake up"" after the movements have stopped. The person was injured during the seizure. If you're concerned that something else may be wrong, or the person has another medical condition such as heart disease or diabetes, call a doctor."
89,What can you do for someone having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure?,"It's all about taking precautions. For someone having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure: Give them room. Keep other people back. Clear hard or sharp objects, like glasses and furniture, away. Cushion their head. Loosen clothing around their neck, if you can safely. Don't try to hold them down or stop their movements. Don't put anything in their mouth. Contrary to popular myth, you can't swallow your tongue during a seizure. But putting something in their mouth could damage their teeth, or they might bite you. If their head isn't moving, turn it to one side. Look at your watch at the start of the seizure, so you can time its length. Remember, this probably isn't an emergency, although it may look like one. After the jerking stops, gently place them on their side, to help keep their airway clear."
89,What can you do for someone having a mild seizure?,"They're frightening to watch, and someone who has one rarely knows or remembers what's happening. They won't answer if you talk to them. Clear hard or sharp objects, like glasses and furniture, away. Reassure them and explain what they missed if they're confused or frightened. Don't give them anything to drink or eat until they've completely recovered."
90,Do atherectomies work as well as bypass surgery for treating atherosclerosis?,"These procedures have good commonsense appeal, but they don't work as well as stenting or bypass surgery. They are rarely used, and only in special cases. Usually, atherectomy is used to improve the success of placing a stent."
90,What medicines might your doctor recommend after you get surgery to open blocked arteries?,"After stenting or coronary bypass surgery, most people should take a daily regimen of anti-atherosclerosis medication that includes: A statin, to lower cholesterol levels An aspirin, to prevent blood clots Plavix (clopidogrel), Effient (prasugrel), or Brilinta (ticagrelor) also work to prevent clots, especially if a stent was placed. They are normally taken for one month up to a year depending on the type of stent. Blood pressure drugs, especially beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors Also important are three lifestyle habits proven to reduce heart disease: Exercise 30 minutes most days of the week Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily Most of all, don't smoke"
90,What are the two types of atherectomies for arteries blocked by atherosclerosis?,"The particles dissipate without causing major damage. Directional atherectomy: A rotating blade cuts slices of plaque, which are captured by the catheter and removed from the body."
90,What is a stent and how is it used during an angioplasty for treating advanced atherosclerosis?,"A stent is a tiny cylinder of wire mesh. During an angioplasty, a balloon on the catheter tip is inflated inside a blockage to open it. Stents can be placed during this process and are left behind once the balloon and catheter are removed. Stents can relieve chronic symptoms of chest pain (angina), or reopen a blocked artery during a heart attack. Coronary angioplasty with stenting has a low complication rate. The recovery time is often less than one day."
90,What is coronary bypass surgery for treating advanced atherosclerosis?,"In an angioplasty, a doctor first introduces a catheter (a narrow tube) into an artery in the leg or arm. He or she sews this healthy vessel onto the coronary artery, rerouting blood around the clogged artery. Coronary artery bypass surgery -- or CABG (pronounced ""cabbage"") -- is the most commonly performed bypass surgery. CABG can provide relief from chest pain caused by atherosclerosis. Bypass surgery also leads to increased survival in people with diabetes or with multiple or severely blocked coronary arteries."
90,How do you treat advanced atherosclerosis?,"Narrowed arteries can frequently be reopened with one of two treatments: stenting or bypass surgery. Because these atherosclerosis treatments come with risks, they are typically reserved for emergencies or when medications fail. Which is the better treatment for the late stages of atherosclerosis -- stents or bypass surgery? Sometimes treatment with drugs can't control chronic chest pain."
91,Are there alternative therapies for essential tremor?,"Currently, there is no evidence that alternative treatments are beneficial in treating Essential Tremor. Patients who have tremors that worsen with emotional stress may find relaxation therapies helpful at temporarily easing symptoms. Some herbal supplements may make tremor worse. Always consult your doctor before trying any alternative therapy."
91,What should you tell your doctor about before taking Mysoline?,"Before taking Mysoline, be sure to tell your doctor if you: Are pregnant or nursing Are taking any medications ( Mysoline may interact with several different types of drugs.) Have kidney or liver problems Have blood count problems In addition, you should avoid alcoholic beverages while taking Mysoline. Do not stop taking the drug suddenly or switch brands without first consulting with your health care provider."
91,How is Neurontin used in treating essential tremor?,"Experts use Neurontin for short-term treatment of Essential Tremor affecting the hands, although it is not known how the drug works. In most cases, it is not used in conjunction with other drugs. Side effects of Neurontin are rare but include: Sedation Walking difficulties Irritability Weight gain Some people with Essential Tremor report symptom relief after drinking a glass of wine or a cocktail."
91,What is Mysoline for essential tremor?,Primidone ( Mysoline) is an anti-seizure drug that is also effective for treating essential tremor. It is most useful for people with hand tremor.
91,What can benzodiazepines do to help  essential tremor?,"Benzodiazepines ( Ativan, Klonopin, Valium, and Xanax) may help people whose Essential Tremor is not improved by other drugs. These drugs appear to relieve tremors associated with emotional stress or anxiety. Side effects of benzodiazepines include confusion, memory loss, and sedation. For most people this is not a good long-term solution."
91,Why are drug treatments used for essential tremor?,"Topiramate ( Topamax), another drug used to treat epilepsy and migraine, helps some people. With the use of medication, people with essential tremor may see improvement in their ability to control their tremor and improvement in activities such as drinking from a cup or using food utensils. More specialized motor functions, such as being able to thread a needle, may still be too difficult. However, for most people, essential tremor is not disabling. For most people this is not a good long-term solution."
91,What is Topiramate (Topamax)?,"Topiramate ( Topamax), another drug used to treat epilepsy and migraine, helps some people. It is most useful for people with hand tremor. It is important to start with a very low dose and slowly increase the dose to avoid sleepiness. Many patients may experience a feeling of mental dullness or drowsiness and should consult with their doctor about adjusting the dose. As many as 30% to 40% of people do not tolerate this drug in higher doses."
92,How can I prevent tonsillitis?,"Hand washing remains crucial in preventing the spread of viruses and bacteria that cause tonsillitis. Avoid prolonged contact with anyone who has strep throat and has not been taking antibiotics for at least 24 hours. To be certain, avoid people who have been ill until such time as you are sure they no longer are."
92,Why do people get tonsillectomy?,"In the last 30 years, although tonsillectomy is frequently performed for recurrent infections, the most common reason for removing tonsils is tonsil-enlargement (hypertrophy) causing obstructive symptoms such as snoring, sleep apnea, and difficulty swallowing."
92,How do you know if your child's tonsillitis is due to a virus or bacteria?,"Your pediatrician will examine your child's tonsils and take a throat swab to check for strep throat. The test can be done with results available during the office visit. This is the rapid strep test. If this is negative a culture is done for confirmation which takes 24-48 hours. If the throat culture is negative for bacteria, the infection is probably caused by a virus and requires only treatment for relief of symptoms."
93,How can you move your body to help with ADHD?,"Move your body: Exercise is good for everyone, but it can do more than improve your heart health if you have ADHD. Even a little regular exercise can ease ADHD symptoms. After you exercise, you'll feel more focused and have more energy to stay on task. Shoot for 20 to 30 minutes a day. If you work in an office, a brisk walk during lunch may be the ticket to beating your brain's afternoon slump."
93,How can you control clutter to help with ADHD?,"Control clutter: Another way to quiet your brain is to clear your space of things you don't need. It can prevent distractions, and it can help you stay organized because you'll have fewer things to tidy up. Go paperless -- take your name off junk mailing lists and pay bills online. Get some organizational helpers like under-the-bed containers or over-the-door holders. Ask a friend to help if it seems like you're swimming in a sea of debris and you don't know where to start."
93,How can you reward yourself to help with ADHD?,"Reward yourself: Sticking to a task can be easier when there's a mood booster at the end. Before you tackle a project, decide on a reward for yourself once you're done. Positive reinforcement can help you stay the course."
93,How can you quiet your mind to help with ADHD?,"Quiet your mind by quieting your space: When it's time to buckle down and get something done, take away the distractions. Use noise-canceling headphones to drown out sounds. Put your phone on silent. Work in a room with a door you can close. If you can do your job from home, set up the space in a way that helps you focus."
93,How can you learn to say no to help with ADHD?,"Learn to say no: Impulsive behavior can be a side effect of having ADHD. This means your brain might bite off more than it can handle. If you find yourself overwhelmed, try to say no to a few things. Ask yourself: Can I really get this done? Be honest with yourself and with others about what's possible and what's not. Once you get comfortable saying no, you'll be able to enjoy the things you say yes to even more."
93,How can you be realistic about time to help with ADHD?,"Be realistic about time: Your brain is wired differently than other people's, and it may take you longer to get things done. That's OK. Figure out a realistic time frame for your daily tasks -- and don't forget to build in time for breaks if you think you'll need them."
93,How can you make a schedule to help with ADHD?,"Make a schedule: Choose a time that's quiet and unhurried -- maybe at night before you go to bed -- and plan out the next day, down to the task. Use a reminder app, timer, or alarm to help you stick to that schedule. Alternate things you want to do with ones you don't to help your mind stay engaged."
93,What is it like to have ADHD?,"It can prevent distractions, and it can help you stay organized because you'll have fewer things to tidy up. Even a little regular exercise can ease ADHD symptoms."
94,What does what you eat when working out depend on if you have type 2 diabetes?,What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar.
94,When is the best time to eat after working out if I have diabetes?,"Even if you don't need a snack right after you work out, you'll still need to build your energy back to help your muscles recover. The best time to eat is between 30 minutes and 2 hours after you're done."
94,What should you eat if you plan on working out for at least an hour if you have diabetes?,"These snacks offer 15 grams of carbs with little prep time: 1 small piece of fresh fruit (4 ounces) 1 slice of bread (1 ounce) or 1 (6-inch) tortilla 1/2 cup of oatmeal 2/3 cup of plain fat-free yogurt or sweetened with sugar substitutes These have 30 grams of carbs: 1/2 peanut butter sandwich (1 slice whole wheat bread with 1 tablespoon peanut butter) and 1 cup milk 1 English muffin and 1 teaspoon low-fat margarine 3/4 cup whole grain, ready-to-eat cereal and 1/2 cup fat-free milk If your reading is below 150 mg/dl and you plan to work out for at least an hour, choose something with protein. These choices have it and less than 5 grams of carbs each: 15 almonds 1 tablespoon peanut butter 1 hard-boiled egg 1 piece of string cheese Many people with diabetes find that snacks with a ratio of 3 grams of carbs to 1 gram of protein work well."

These choices have it and less than 5 grams of carbs each: 15 almonds 1 tablespoon peanut butter 1 hard-boiled egg 1 piece of string cheese Many people with diabetes find that snacks with a ratio of 3 grams of carbs to 1 gram of protein work well. There's no need to take a protein supplement. Your food has enough."
94,Is it normal for my blood sugar to still be low for up to 24 hours after exercise?,"Your sugar level can drop for up to 24 hours after moderate or intense exercise. If it's still below 100 mg/dl at bedtime, double up on your snack. If you take insulin, ask your doctor if it's OK to lower your dose at bedtime."
94,How do I know what I should eat before or after working out if I have diabetes?,What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar.
94,What should you eat when you work out if you have type 2 diabetes?,"You'll need to fuel up the right way before, during, and after you work out. If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack."
94,How can I prepare for long exercise sessions if I have diabetes?,"If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise. If you're going to head out for a bike trip, marathon, or day-long hike, take some snacks with you. Food may not be easy to carry around if you're in a race. Glucose gels and tablets or sports drinks can be good options. Count the carbs like you would with food. Tip: Your body will absorb carbs more quickly if they're in liquids and gels. This can come in handy if you're going full tilt."
94,What are easy snacks with 30 grams of carbs?,"These snacks offer 15 grams of carbs with little prep time: 1 small piece of fresh fruit (4 ounces) 1 slice of bread (1 ounce) or 1 (6-inch) tortilla 1/2 cup of oatmeal 2/3 cup of plain fat-free yogurt or sweetened with sugar substitutes These have 30 grams of carbs: 1/2 peanut butter sandwich (1 slice whole wheat bread with 1 tablespoon peanut butter) and 1 cup milk 1 English muffin and 1 teaspoon low-fat margarine 3/4 cup whole grain, ready-to-eat cereal and 1/2 cup fat-free milk If your reading is below 150 mg/dl and you plan to work out for at least an hour, choose something with protein."
94,What should you do after you work out if you have type 2 diabetes?,"If your next regularly scheduled meal or snack is 30-60 minutes later, 15 grams of carbs should hold you. If your next meal or snack is more than an hour away, have about 15 grams of carbs and 7 or 8 grams of protein. Your sugar level can drop for up to 24 hours after moderate or intense exercise. If it's still below 100 mg/dl at bedtime, double up on your snack. If you take insulin, ask your doctor if it's OK to lower your dose at bedtime. Even if you don't need a snack right after you work out, you'll still need to build your energy back to help your muscles recover. The best time to eat is between 30 minutes and 2 hours after you're done."

94,How do you know what to eat before you work out if you have type 2 diabetes?,"If your reading is between 200 and 300 mg/dl and you've already eaten at least once that day, you probably don't need to eat anything. But you do need to check for ketones if it's over 250. Your body makes them when it burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. Don't exercise if you have them. If your reading is over 300, ask your doctor if exercise is OK. Otherwise, grab a snack with 15-30 grams of carbs. The lower your blood sugar is before you start and the longer you plan to work out, the larger your snack should be, up to 30 grams of carbs. You'll probably have to try a few options and amounts to see what works best. Check your blood sugar every hour."
94,Do I need to eat certain things before working out if I have diabetes?,"You'll need to fuel up the right way before, during, and after you work out. If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise."

Exercising on an empty stomach in the morning can raise it. But food sends a signal to your pancreas to make insulin, which keeps it at a safe level. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise."
94,How often should I check my blood sugar during a long exercise session?,"What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar. How many carbs your snacks should have depends on how much longer you plan to exercise and what your reading says. The idea is to eat enough carbs to keep you from having a low reading or just plain conking out, but not so many that your levels spike. It may take a few tries to figure out the right balance."
94,What do my blood sugar levels indicate regarding exercise?,"If your reading is between 200 and 300 mg/dl and you've already eaten at least once that day, you probably don't need to eat anything. But you do need to check for ketones if it's over 250. Your body makes them when it burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. Don't exercise if you have them. If your reading is over 300, ask your doctor if exercise is OK. Check your blood sugar every hour."
95,Who are physical therapists and what kind of pain do they treat?,"Physical Therapists What they treat: These professionals work with people recovering from injury or surgery. Physical therapists may use massage, stretching, heat, ice, and exercise to help ease your pain and increase your mobility. How to find one: Go to the website of the American Physical Therapy Association (apta.org)."
96,How can diabetes affect my oral health?,"The good news: Good habits will help keep your mouth healthy. Diabetes can make you more likely to have cavities and fungal infections. Other potential problems include: Difficulty fighting off infections, including those that might lead to gum disease Slower healing time after dental surgery Dry mouth, called xerostomia, is common among people with diabetes. Saliva is important to oral health -- it helps wash away food particles and keep the mouth moist. When you don't produce enough moisture, bacteria thrive, tissues can get irritated and inflamed, and your teeth can be more prone to decay."
96,What are ways to take care of my teeth while dealing with diabetes?,"Make sure you brush at least twice a day and floss once a day. Use an antibacterial mouth rinse twice a day to help curb bacteria that can cause plaque buildup on teeth and gums. Check your mouth for inflammation or signs of bleeding gums. If you notice either, let your dentist know as soon as possible. Have your teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months, or even every 3 or 4 months. Give her the names of all prescription and over-the-counter drugs you take. Make sure your diabetes is well controlled."
97,When should I see a doctor right away about my drug allergy?,"Difficulty breathing or wheezing Tightness in the throat or a feeling that the airways are closing Hoarseness or trouble speaking Swollen lips, tongue, or throat Nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting Fast heartbeat or pulse Anxiety or dizziness Loss of consciousness Hives and trouble breathing Other symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) Had severe reactions in the past See a doctor immediately for these symptoms: A fast-spreading painful red or blistered area on the skin Swollen face, tongue, or lips, even without breathing difficulty or increase in swelling Top layer of skin peels off in sheets without blistering Scalded-looking raw areas of flesh Discomfort Fever Condition spreading to eyes, mouth, and genitals Call the doctor as soon as possible if the person has: Skin rash, itching, a feeling of warmth, or hives See Severe Allergic Reaction Treatment."
97,When should I get medical attention for a drug allergy?,"Difficulty breathing or wheezing Tightness in the throat or a feeling that the airways are closing Hoarseness or trouble speaking Swollen lips, tongue, or throat Nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting Fast heartbeat or pulse Anxiety or dizziness Loss of consciousness Hives and trouble breathing Other symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) Had severe reactions in the past See a doctor immediately for these symptoms: A fast-spreading painful red or blistered area on the skin Swollen face, tongue, or lips, even without breathing difficulty or increase in swelling Top layer of skin peels off in sheets without blistering Scalded-looking raw areas of flesh Discomfort Fever Condition spreading to eyes, mouth, and genitals Call the doctor as soon as possible if the person has: Skin rash, itching, a feeling of warmth, or hives See Severe Allergic Reaction Treatment."
97,How can I control itching caused by drug allergy?,"For a mild reaction: Give an adult an over-the-counter antihistamine. Check with a doctor before giving an antihistamine to a child. Use cool compresses on the area or have the person take cool showers. Avoid strong soaps, detergents, and other chemicals. Stay in a cool room. Have the person wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothes. For a rash, apply calamine lotion."
98,What is different about breast cancer in younger women?,"Diagnosing breast cancer in women under 40 years old is more difficult, because their breast tissue is generally denser than in older women. By the time a lump in a younger woman's breast can be felt, the cancer may be advanced. In addition, breast cancer in younger women can be aggressive and less likely to respond to treatment. Women who are diagnosed at a younger age also are more likely to have a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Delays in diagnosing breast cancer can cause problems. Many younger women ignore the warning signs -- such as a breast lump or unusual nipple discharge -- because they believe they're too young to get breast cancer. They may assume a lump is a harmless cyst or other growth. Some doctors may also dismiss breast lumps in young women as cysts."
98,What are the treatment options for breast cancer in younger women?,"Treatment options include: Surgery: either a lumpectomy, which involves removing the tumor and some surrounding tissue, or a mastectomy, which is the removal of a breast. Radiation is generally used following a lumpectomy, and chemotherapyand hormone therapy often are recommended after surgery to help destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent a return. Breast cancer treatment can affect your sexuality, fertility, and pregnancy. If you'd like to have children, talk to your doctor it before you begin treatment."
98,How are treatment decisions for breast cancer in young women made?,"Treatment decisions are made based whether or not it has spread beyond the breast, as well as the woman's general health and personal circumstances."
98,What puts you at risk for breast cancer?,"The following put you at higher risk: A personal history of breast cancer or some noncancerous breast diseases A family history of breast cancer, particularly in a mother, daughter, or sister History of radiation treatments to the chest before age 40 Having a specific genetic defect such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation Getting your period before age 12 For some women, your age when you had your first child Other risk factors include heavy alcohol use, high intake of red meat, dense breasts, obesity, and race."
98,Should women under age 40 get mammograms?,"In general, regular mammograms aren't recommended for women under 40 years of age, in part because breast tissue tends to be dense, making mammograms less effective. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 40 to 44 should have a choice to start yearly screening mammograms if they would like. Women ages 45 through 54 should have a mammogram each year and those 55 years and over should continue getting mammograms every 1 to 2 years.. Most experts believe the low risk at that age doesn't justify the exposure to radiation or the cost of mammography. But mammograms may be recommended for younger women with a family history of breast cancer and other risk factors."
98,Can birth control pills affect your risk for breast cancer?,"Other studies, however, show no such effect. Most experts believe the low risk at that age doesn't justify the exposure to radiation or the cost of mammography."
98,What is the best way for younger women to screen for breast cancer?,"But mammograms may be recommended for younger women with a family history of breast cancer and other risk factors. The American Cancer Society ( ACS) recommends that all women know how their breasts look and feel and report any changes to their doctor. The ACS states that research has not shown a clear benefit of performing regular breast self-exams. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of breast self-exam. Regular breast exams done at least every 3 years by your doctor are recommended for women beginning at age 20. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every 2 years from ages 50 through 74 and also that the decision to start yearly screening mammograms before age 50 should be an individual one.. Talk to your doctor about when you should begin to have mammograms. For younger women, digital mammography may be an alternate to a standard mammogram. If you'd like to have children, talk to your doctor it before you begin treatment."
98,Can young women get breast cancer?,"But it can happen at any age, and it's important to be aware of your risk factors, regardless of your age. Diagnosing breast cancer in women under 40 years old is more difficult, because their breast tissue is generally denser than in older women. Expert groups don't all agree when women should start getting mammograms and you should discuss with your doctor what's right for you."
99,How do you treat periodic limb movement disorder?,Treatment does not cure the disorder but usually relieves symptoms. Treatment involves medication that either reduces the movements or helps the person sleep through the movements.
99,What is nocturnal myoclonus?,"When PLMD was first described in the 1950s, it was called nocturnal myoclonus. Nocturnal means night, and myoclonus is a rapid, rhythmic contraction of a group of muscles similar to that seen in seizures. PLMD movements are not myoclonus, however, and the original name is not used today."
99,What causes periodic limb movement disorder?,"Periodic limb movement disorder can be primary or secondary. Secondary PLMD is caused by an underlying medical problem. Primary PLMD, on the other hand, has no known cause."
99,What are common medical causes of periodic limb movement disorder?,"Diabetes mellitus Iron deficiency Spinal cord tumor Spinal cord injury Sleep apnea syndrome - Breathing difficulties that disrupt sleep, causing daytime sleepiness and a number of other problems Narcolepsy - A sleep disorder involving excessive sleepiness and overpowering urge to sleep during waking hours Uremia - Build-up of waste products in the blood because of poor kidney function Anemia - Low level of hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen in the blood Medication - Neuroleptics and other antidopaminergic agents such as Haldol, dopaminergic agents such as Sinemet (despite the fact that Sinemet is often a treatment for PLMD), or tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline ( Elavil) Withdrawal from sedative medications such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines (such as Valium) The most common symptoms noted by people with PLMD are not leg movements but poor sleep and daytime sleepiness."
99,Can you cure periodic limb movement disorder?,Primary PLMD may be chronic (permanent). Many people with primary PLMD have improved nighttime sleep (remission) but experience one or more relapses over time.
99,What is periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)?,"It is the only movement disorder that occurs only during sleep, and it is sometimes called periodic leg (or limb) movements during sleep. "" Periodic"" refers to the fact that the movements are repetitive and rhythmic, occurring about every 20-40 seconds. PLMD is also considered a sleep disorder, because the movements often disrupt sleep and lead to daytime sleepiness. PLMD may occur with other sleep disorders. It is often linked with restless legs syndrome, but they are not the same thing."
99,What medications treat periodic limb movement disorder?,"Many of these are also causes of restless legs syndrome. Benzodiazepines: These drugs suppress muscle contractions. It is probably the most widely used drug to treat PLMD. Dopaminergic agents: These drugs increased the levels of an important neurotransmitter (brain chemical) called dopamine, which is important in regulating muscle movements. These medications seem to improve the condition in some people but not in others. GABA agonists: These agents inhibit release of certain neurotransmitters that stimulate muscle contractions."
99,What are symptoms of periodic limb movement disorder?,"Typically the knee, ankle, and big toe joints all bend as part of the movements. In most people with PLMD, poor sleep and daytime sleepiness are the most bothersome symptoms. Many people do not link their sleep problem with leg movements."
100,Is my stress affecting my poop?,"The digestive system is especially sensitive to stress, and constipation can be one response. Whether it's for business or pleasure, travel is stressful. When it disrupts your regular routines, especially eating patterns, your pooping can get off-schedule as well."
100,How does pregnancy affect how I poop?,"That's especially true during pregnancy, when hormone changes can easily throw off your digestive system. Add the pressure a growing baby puts on your plumbing, and it's no surprise you have trouble going. Problems with pooping are also common after childbirth. What about my age? The chance of having trouble moving your bowels goes up as you get older, so make a point to get more exercise, drink more water, and eat more fiber."
100,How can I get more fiber?,"Moving your bowels regularly takes fiber -- lots of it. We're talking about 3 to 5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day. Go easy on meat and dairy and load up on produce. Just be sure you add it to your diet gradually. Skip fast and prepared foods. They may be quick and easy, but they're almost always low in fiber."
100,How do my medications affect how I poop?,"Iron or calcium supplements can cause constipation in some people. Also on the list are meds for diabetes and Parkinson's disease, plus some blood pressure treatments. Over-the-counter medications like antacids can also stop things up."
100,How do I know my diet is affecting how I poop?,"You're not alone. Just be sure you add it to your diet gradually. If that doesn't help, talk to your doctor about other options to get you going or whether you can get these nutrients through your diet instead. Could it be a more serious problem? Colon trouble."
101,What is the outlook for costochondritis?,"Noninfectious costochondritis will go away on its own, with or without anti-inflammatory treatment. Most people will recover fully. Infectious costochondritis responds well to IV antibiotics and surgical repair, but recovery may take a long time."
101,What tests are used to determine if an infection is causing costochondritis?,"To determine if infection is the cause of chest pain, doctors will: Look for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pus, and drainage at the site of surgery Order a more sophisticated imaging study of the chest called a gallium scan, which will show increased uptake of the radioactive material gallium in an area of infection Check the white blood cell count to see if it is elevated, a sign of infection Order a chest X-ray if pneumonia is a suspected cause of chest pain Order an ECG and other tests if a heart problem is suspected Costochondritis is a less common cause of chest pain in adults but occurs fairly frequently in people who have had cardiac surgery."
101,How does costochondritis differ from Tietze syndrome?,"Tietze syndrome is often referred to as costochondritis, but the two are distinct conditions. You can tell the difference by noting the following: Tietze syndrome is rare. It usually comes on abruptly, with chest pain radiating to your arms or shoulder and lasting several weeks. Tietze syndrome is accompanied by a localized swelling at the painful area (the junction of the ribs and breastbone)."
101,How can you prevent costochondritis?,Costochondritis is an inflammatory process but usually has no definite cause.
101,What are some home remedies for costochondritis?,"The following home remedies may provide relief from costochondritis: Taking pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve) as needed Using local heat or ice to relieve pain Avoiding unnecessary exercise or activities that make the symptoms worse; avoiding contact sports until there is improvement in symptoms, and then returning to normal activities only as tolerated Doing stretching exercises Costochondritis responds to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil or Motrin) and naproxen ( Aleve)."
101,When should you go to a hospital for costochondritis?,"Call the doctor for any of the following symptoms: Trouble breathing High fever Signs of infection such as redness, pus, and increased swelling at the rib joints Continuing or worsening pain despite medication Nausea Sweating Dizziness Go to a hospital's emergency room if you have difficulty breathing or any of the following symptoms occur. These symptoms are generally not associated with costochondritis: High fever not responding to fever-reducers such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil) Signs of infection at the tender spot, such as pus, redness, increased pain, and swelling Persistent chest pain of any type associated with nausea, sweating, left arm pain, or any generalized chest pain that is not well localized. These may be signs of a heart attack. If you are not sure what is causing your condition, always go to the emergency room."
101,How is costochondritis compared to Tietze syndrome?,"Although some doctors use the terms costochondritis and Tietze syndrome interchangeably, Tietze syndrome has a sudden onset without any preceding respiratory illness or any history of minor trauma. In Tietze syndrome, there is frequently radiation of pain to arms and shoulders, as well as pain and tenderness associated with swelling at the spot that hurts."
101,When should you call the doctor for costochondritis?,"Call the doctor for any of the following symptoms: Trouble breathing High fever Signs of infection such as redness, pus, and increased swelling at the rib joints Continuing or worsening pain despite medication Nausea Sweating Dizziness Go to a hospital's emergency room if you have difficulty breathing or any of the following symptoms occur."
101,How common is costochondritis in children?,"Costochondritis (with unknown cause) is a common cause of chest pain in children and adolescents. It accounts for 10% to 30% of all chest pain in children. Annually, doctors evaluate about 650,000 cases of chest pain in young people ages 10 to 21. The peak age for the condition is ages 12-14."
101,What are the symptoms of costochondritis?,"The pain, which may be dull, usually will be sharp and located on your front chest wall. It may radiate to your back or abdomen and is more common on your left side. There can be pain with a deep breath or cough. The most common sites of pain are your fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. This pain increases as you move your trunk or take deep breaths. Conversely, it decreases as your movement stops or with quiet breathing. The reproducible tenderness you feel when you press on the rib joints (costochondral junctions) is a constant feature of costochondritis. Without this tenderness, a diagnosis of costochondritis is unlikely. When costochondritis occurs as a result of infection after surgery, you will see redness, swelling, or pus discharge at the site of the surgery."
101,What problems are associated with costochondritis in adults?,"Chest pain in adults is considered a potentially serious sign of a heart problem by most doctors until proven otherwise. Chest pain in adults usually leads to a battery of tests to rule out heart attack and heart disease. If those tests are normal and your physical exam is consistent with costochondritis, your doctor will diagnose costochondritis as the cause of your chest pain. It is important, however, for adults with chest pain to be examined and tested for heart disease before being diagnosed with costochondritis. It is often difficult to distinguish between the two without further testing. The condition affects females more than males (70% versus 30%). Costochondritis may also occur as the result of an infection or as a complication of surgery on your sternum. Occasionally, costochondritis as a result of bacterial infections can occur in people who use IV drugs or who have had surgery to their upper chest."
101,What is the follow-up treatment for costochondritis?,"Your doctor will refer you to a surgeon for consultation should this option be considered necessary. Infectious costochondritis responds well to IV antibiotics and surgical repair, but recovery may take a long time."
101,What should you know about costochondritis?,"Costochondritis is a relatively harmless condition and usually goes away without treatment. The cause is usually unknown, but may happen from increased activity involving the arms. Tietze syndrome is accompanied by a localized swelling at the painful area (the junction of the ribs and breastbone). The diagnosis can only be reached after excluding more serious causes of chest pain that are related to the heart and lungs."
101,When is surgery needed for costochondritis?,There is no specific test for diagnosing costochondritis. Your doctor will refer you to a surgeon for consultation should this option be considered necessary.
102,How can endometriosis keep me from getting pregnant?,"But when they interfere with your reproductive organs, your ability to get pregnant can become an issue: When endometrial tissue wraps around your ovaries, it can block your eggs from releasing. The tissue can block sperm from making its way up your fallopian tubes. It can also stop a fertilized egg from sliding down your tubes to your uterus. A surgeon can fix those problems, but endometriosis can make it hard for you to conceive in other ways: It can change your body's hormonal chemistry. It can cause your body's immune system to attack the embryo. It can affect the layer of tissue lining your uterus where the egg implants itself."
102,How is endometriosis treated?,"First, your doctor can surgically remove the endometrial tissue. Your doctor may consider pairing IUI with something called âcontrolled ovarian hyperstimulationâ -- using medicine to help your ovaries produce more eggs. In vitro fertilization ( IVF) is also another option. It can increase your chances of conceiving, although the statistics on IVF pregnancies vary."
102,Can I get pregnant if I have endometriosis?,"Can you get pregnant? Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases, and it's the leading cause of infertility. It affects about 5 million women in the United States, many in their 30s and 40s. Nearly 2 of every 5 women who can't get pregnant have it. It's a painful condition in which tissue that should be growing inside the uterus grows on the outside. The good news is that there are treatment options, but each has different rates of success."
103,"What are symptoms of the third stage of HIV, or AIDS?","AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection. This is usually when your CD4 T-cell number drops below 200. You can also be diagnosed with AIDS if you have an "" AIDS defining illness"" such as Kaposi's sarcoma (a form of skin cancer) or pneumocystis pneumonia (a lung disease). If you didn't know you were infected with HIV earlier, you may realize it after you have some of these symptoms: Being tired all of the time Swollen lymph nodes in your neck or groin Fever that lasts for more than 10 days Night sweats Unexplained weight loss Purplish spots on your skin that don't go away Shortness of breath Severe, long-lasting diarrhea Yeast infections in your mouth, throat, or vagina Bruises or bleeding you can't explain People with AIDS who don't take medication only survive about 3 years, even less if they get a dangerous infection."
103,What are the symptoms of the first stage of HIV?,"The symptoms are similar to those of other viral illnesses, and they're often compared to the flu. They typically last a week or two and then completely go away. They include: Headache Fatigue Aching muscles Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes A red rash that doesn't itch, usually on your torso Fever If you have symptoms like these and might have been exposed to someone with HIV in the past 2-6 weeks, you should go to a doctor and ask that you get an HIV test, even if you have had a negative test in the past."
103,How long can you survive with AIDS if you don't take medication?,"If you didn't know you were infected with HIV earlier, you may realize it after you have some of these symptoms: Being tired all of the time Swollen lymph nodes in your neck or groin Fever that lasts for more than 10 days Night sweats Unexplained weight loss Purplish spots on your skin that don't go away Shortness of breath Severe, long-lasting diarrhea Yeast infections in your mouth, throat, or vagina Bruises or bleeding you can't explain People with AIDS who don't take medication only survive about 3 years, even less if they get a dangerous infection. But HIV can still be treated at this stage. If you start on HIV drugs, stay on them, follow your doctor's advice regarding other conditions you may have, and have But with the right treatment and a healthy lifestyle, you can live a long time."
104,How can your genes put you at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"Some people have fewer copies of a gene that helps to fight HIV. We might someday have a test that can tell you if you're more likely to get HIV and develop AIDS, but there isn't one yet."
104,How can shared needles put you at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"The other big risk is reusing needles, syringes, or other equipment an HIV-positive person used to inject drugs, whether they were prescribed by a doctor or illegal. You shouldn't even reuse your own. You could also get HIV from a needle used for piercing or tattooing if it wasn't sterilized after piercing or tattooing someone with HIV. An accidental stick from a contaminated needle or medical device could cause HIV, but that's very rare."
104,How can donated blood put you at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"It's possible if you had a blood transfusion or were given blood products before 1985. Since then, all blood in the United States and Western Europe gets tested for HIV."
104,What do you need to know about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"So you're at risk when body fluids from someone who's infected could get into and mix with yours. Since then, all blood in the United States and Western Europe gets tested for HIV."
105,What are dental implants?,Dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.
105,What is the importance of dental implants?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Despite improvements in dental care, millions of Americans suffer tooth loss -- mostly due to tooth decay, periodontal disease, or injury. For many years, the only treatment options available for people with missing teeth were bridges and dentures."
105,How do I care for dental implants?,"Dental implants require the same care as real teeth, including brushing, flossing, rinsing with an antibacterial mouthwash, and regular dental check-ups."
105,How successful are dental implants?,"But, today, dental implants are available. With proper care (see below), implants can last a lifetime."
106,How do urinary incontinence products help men?,"While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation."
106,How does a penile clamp help male incontinence?,"A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."
106,How does a drainage bag help with male incontinence?,"These are just the plastic bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps."
106,How does an underpad help male incontinence?,These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection.
106,How do toilet substitutes help male incontinence?,"But if you're having a problem with male incontinence, these products can really help. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinence, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom."
106,How does an external catheter help male incontinence?,"External catheters. The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."
107,What are some symptoms of an insulin overdose?,"If you have low blood sugar because of an insulin overdose, you may have: Anxiety Confusion Extreme hunger Fatigue Irritability Sweating or clammy skin Trembling hands If your blood sugar levels continue to fall, you could have seizures or pass out."
107,What are the signs of an insulin overdose?,"Cold sweats, trembling hands, intense anxiety, a general sense of confusion -- these are signs of low blood sugar."
107,What should someone do if they have an insulin overdose?,"Don't panic. Most insulin overdoses can be treated at home. Follow these steps if you're able: Check your blood sugar. You'll need to know where you're starting from. Drink one-half cup of regular soda or sweetened fruit juice, and eat a hard candy or have glucose paste, tablets, or gel. If you skipped a meal, eat something now. Something with 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrates should raise your blood sugar. Rest. Get off your feet and take a break. Recheck your blood sugar after 15 or 20 minutes. If it's still low, take another 15 to 20 grams of a quick-acting sugar, and eat something if you can. Pay attention to how you feel for the next few hours. If you still have symptoms, check your sugar again an hour after eating. Keep snacking if your sugar is low. Get medical help if your sugar level stays low after 2 hours or if your symptoms don't get better."
107,What should someone do if they see a family member or friend suffer from an insulin overdose?,"You'll need to know where you're starting from. They may need to inject you with something called glucagon. It's an insulin antidote. If you're prone to low blood sugar, ask your doctor if you should have glucagon on hand at home. If you're alert enough to follow instructions, they should give you sweet juice to drink. If your symptoms don't steadily improve during the next hour, they should call 911."
107,Which is more harmful between a high sugar level or a low sugar level?,"One high level won't hurt you, but a very low level can. It'll make it much easier for you to stay on track."
107,What are some signs of low blood sugar?,"Your doctor may call it hypoglycemia. It often happens when you take too much insulin. Hypoglycemia happens to many people with diabetes. It can be serious. Thankfully, most insulin problems can be avoided if you follow a few simple rules. If you have low blood sugar because of an insulin overdose, you may have: Anxiety Confusion Extreme hunger Fatigue Irritability Sweating or clammy skin Trembling hands If your blood sugar levels continue to fall, you could have seizures or pass out."
108,How can you protect yourself from squamous cell carcinoma?,"Wear clothing to cover exposed areas. Avoid tanning beds. If you've been diagnosed with skin cancer, you're more likely to get it again -- so visit your doctor for regular skin checks."
108,What are the symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?,"It's usually rough and crusty, and can bleed easily when scraped. Large growths may itch or hurt. It may also pop through scars or chronic skin sores, so check for any changes and report them to your doctor."
108,What factors make it more likely for someone to develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?,"Certain things make you more likely to develop SCC: Older age Male Fair-skinned Blue, green, or gray eyes Blonde or red hair Spend time outside; exposed to the sun's UV Rays Tanning beds and bulbs Long-term exposure to chemicals such as arsenic in the water Bowen's disease, HPV, HIV, or AIDS Exposed to radiation Inherited DNA condition .image-container-right { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; } @media screen and (min-width: 25rem) { .image-container-right { float: right; margin-left: 2rem; width: 17.5rem; } } Full size image."
108,What are the symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma?,"SCC usually begins as a dome-shaped bump or a red, scaly patch of skin. It's usually rough and crusty, and can bleed easily when scraped. Large growths may itch or hurt. It may also pop through scars or chronic skin sores, so check for any changes and report them to your doctor."
108,How can I protect myself from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?,"Use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily, even when it's cloudy and raining, to exposed skin, and reapply frequently when outside. Wear clothing to cover exposed areas. Avoid tanning beds. If you've been diagnosed with skin cancer, you're more likely to get it again -- so visit your doctor for regular skin checks."

108,How is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated?,"Depending on the size and location of the SCC, your doctor may choose to use any of the following techniques to remove it: Excision: cutting out the cancer spot and some healthy skin around it, then stitching up the wound Surgery using a small hand tool and an electronic needle to kill cancer cells Mohs surgery: excision and then inspecting the excised skin using a microscope; this requires stitching up the wound Lymph node surgery: remove a piece of the lymph node; uses general anesthesia Dermabrasion: ""sanding"" your affected area of skin with a tool to make way for a new layer Cryosurgery: freezing of the spot using liquid nitrogen Topical chemotherapy: a gel or cream applied to the skin, sometimes with microneedling Targeted drug treatment Photodynamic therapy (a photosensitizing solution applied to your skin then activated with a light or daylight, or sometimes with intense pulsed light) Ablative and nonablative lasers, or chemical peels Superficial radiation therapy Avoid the sun during peak hours."
108,What is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?,"It's usually found on areas of the body damaged by UV rays from the sun or tanning beds. Sun-exposed skin includes the head, neck, chest, upper back, ears, lips, arms, legs, and hands. SCC is a fairly slow-growing skin cancer."
108,How is squamous cell carcinoma  treated?,"Squamous cell carcinoma can usually be treated with minor surgery that can be done in a doctor's office or hospital clinic. Depending on the size and location of the SCC, your doctor may choose to use any of the following techniques to remove it: Excision: cutting out the cancer spot and some healthy skin around it, then stitching up the wound Surgery using a small hand tool and an electronic needle to kill cancer cells Mohs surgery: excision and then inspecting the excised skin using a microscope; this requires stitching up the wound Lymph node surgery: remove a piece of the lymph node; uses general anesthesia Dermabrasion: ""sanding"" your affected area of skin with a tool to make way for a new layer Cryosurgery: freezing of the spot using liquid nitrogen Topical chemotherapy: a gel or cream applied to the skin, sometimes with microneedling Targeted drug treatment Photodynamic therapy (a photosensitizing solution applied to your skin then activated with a light or daylight, or sometimes with intense pulsed light) Ablative and nonablative lasers, or chemical peels Superficial radiation therapy Avoid the sun during peak hours."

119,How can you drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Constant drainage is best during the first 3 to 4 weeks for a new pouch. If the catheter or tube accidentally falls out before that time, you can put it back in with these simple steps: Relax your abdominal muscles. It may be helpful to bend your knee as you do that. Relubricate the catheter with water-soluble lubricant. Don't use Vaseline or other products containing petroleum jelly. Reinsert the catheter up to the preset mark. If you find this hard to do, relax, change positions and try again. During this initial period, you will need to irrigate the catheter several times a day with 1 ounce of tap water and let it drain off."
119,How do you irrigate the catheter in a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Separate the catheter from the drainage bag and drain the contents of the catheter into the basin. Collect 1 ounce of tap water into the bulb syringe. Tip: Mark this spot on the bulb syringe with permanent marker or nail polish for accurate, easy measurement. To insert the ounce of tap water into the catheter, slowly squeeze the bulb syringe to release the water. While you hold the syringe bulb down with your thumb, pinch the catheter and separate the bulb syringe from the catheter. Unpinch the catheter and drain its contents into the basin. Don't withdraw the fluid from the catheter into the syringe. If the fluid you just put in seems to take a long time to come back out, or if mucus blocks the catheter, irrigate again as needed until stool flows freely through the catheter. If water doesn't go in or come back out, the tube may be blocked. You may have to remove the catheter from the stoma and rinse it with cool tap water to clean any mucus built up inside the catheter. Then reinsert the catheter. Don't put in more than 2 ounces of water without the pouch contents emptying. When the stool flow has stopped, reconnect the catheter. Cleanse the skin around it and the stoma. Use a non-oily soap and warm water to do that. Rinse, and pat dry with a soft towel or paper towel. Put two layers of ""split"" dry gauze dressing around the catheter and over the stoma. Secure with tape as needed. Throw out the trash. Wash the basin and the bulb syringe with soap and warm water. Let the supplies air dry, or dry with a clean towel. Wash, rinse, and dry your hands."
119,What is a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Unlike other ileostomies, the K-pouch has a valve that the surgeon makes. She sews the intestine in a special way so that waste material doesn't leak out. Instead, you insert a tube called a catheter when it's time to empty the pouch. As the pouch fills with what's in your intestines (such as liquids and partly digested food), pressure builds up on the pouch and its many stitches. Without relief, the pouch could tear or develop a hole, or the valve could slip or leak."
119,How should you drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy) after the first few weeks?,"After the first 3 to 4 weeks, you can stop the continuous draining and start draining several times per day, or as instructed by your health care provider. Though you usually make this change after seeing your doctor for the first time after the operation, sometimes your doctor will tell you to start doing the following earlier: Drain the pouch every 2 hours during the day while you are awake. Drain at bedtime and first thing in the morning. Don't drink or eat within 2 hours of bedtime. During the night, you will usually set the catheter to constant drainage. You may also set your alarm clock to wake you to empty the pouch."
119,What are other helpful tips about K-pouch (continent ileostomy) care?,"Check the catheter often to be sure drainage flows freely through the tube. Irrigate it twice a day, or as instructed by your ET nurse or doctor. You should also inspect your stoma daily. It should look shiny, moist, and red. If you see any changes, tell your doctor. If your stool becomes too thick and movement through the catheter slows down or has problems, you may need to drink more water, juice, or other beverages that don't have caffeine. Go for 10-12 glasses -- 8 ounces each -- per day. Never take laxative preparations. They can cause diarrhea and lead to dehydration."
119,How should you drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy) after three months?,"Three months after surgery, there are usually no specific restrictions. You'll probably need to empty the pouch four to six times per day and use irrigation two of these times. But anytime you feel full or bloated, drain the pouch. And do it before you work out or go to bed."
119,How often do I drain a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"Right after the operation, you will have what doctors call an indwelling catheter, meaning the surgeon will leave a tube in the pouch to drain continuously. This will last for about 3 to 4 weeks to allow the pouch to mature. After that, you will drain the pouch several times per day. The number of times you need to drain the pouch each day becomes less over time. Talk with your doctor, surgeon, or enterostomal therapist ( ET), a nurse who specializes in the care of stomas. Most likely, you will have met them before the operation. They can remind you of how to take care of your stoma, ostomy, or pouch."
119,What should you do if you think drainage has stopped in your K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"If, at any time, you think pouch drainage has stopped, do these four things: Irrigate the catheter. Pinch the catheter between your finger and thumb and check to see if a fluid or air column is moving up and down. Wiggle the catheter in and out about an inch. If you still think pouch drainage has stopped, remove the catheter in case food particles or debris has blocked it. Flush the catheter with cool tap water, then reinsert it. Irrigate the catheter. While you hold the syringe bulb down with your thumb, pinch the catheter and separate the bulb syringe from the catheter."
119,How can you prepare to clean the catheter and your skin in a K-pouch (continent ileostomy)?,"First, gather these supplies: Washcloths or paper towels Soap that isn't oily Plastic bag or newspaper Dressing Irrigation supplies: tap water, bulb syringe, and basin Wash your hands with soap and warm water, and dry them with a clean towel. Cleanse the skin around it and the stoma."
120,Are there ways to get pregnant that bypass the fallopian tubes?,"Once you begin to successfully ovulate, your doctor may suggest trying artificial insemination, in which sperm is inserted directly into your uterus. Keep in mind that some standard treatments for endometriosis can either prevent pregnancy or, in the case of the hormone Danocrine, cause serious birth defects. Make sure your doctor knows that you are trying to conceive if you're being treated for endometriosis."
120,How do problems with the fallopian tubes affect fertility?,"Problems with the fallopian tubes also account for a significant percentage of infertility cases. Sometimes, the tubes may be blocked or they may be scarred as a result of disease or infection. When an egg is released from one of the ovaries, it travels through one of the fallopian tubes, which are narrow ducts that connect the ovaries to the uterus. Normally, the egg will join with the sperm in the fallopian tubes during conception and the now-fertilized egg will continue on to the uterus. However, the fallopian tubes are extremely fragile. If they are blocked, there's no way for the egg to become fertilized by the sperm."
120,Should I let my doctor know if I'm trying to conceive while being treated for endometriosis?,"Keep in mind that some standard treatments for endometriosis can either prevent pregnancy or, in the case of the hormone Danocrine, cause serious birth defects. Make sure your doctor knows that you are trying to conceive if you're being treated for endometriosis."
120,How do I find out if my fallopian tubes are blocked?,"To determine whether your fallopian tubes are blocked, your doctor may suggest a laparoscopy or a hysterosalpingogram ( HSG). In an HSG test, liquid dye is inserted by catheter through the vagina (cervix) into the uterus. Then, X-rays are taken to see if there is a blockage or if the dye flows freely into the abdomen. Another method of HSG uses saline and air rather than dye and ultrasound instead of X-ray. If you have problems with your fallopian tubes, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct the damage or unblock the tubes."
120,How does endometriosis affect your menstrual cycle?,"The problem is that this tissue behaves like normal endometrial tissue -- it builds up and breaks down with your menstrual cycle -- but it can't be shed like normal endometrial tissue during your period. As a result, the rogue tissue causes irritation and inflammation. This buildup of tissue can prevent the eggs from getting out of the ovaries or being fertilized by sperm. It can also scar and block the fallopian tubes, preventing the egg and sperm from meeting."
120,What are common symptoms of endometriosis?,"In addition to fertility problems, some common signs and symptoms of endometriosis include: Pelvic pain Painful intercourse Painful urination Painful bowel movements Severe abdominal pain Lower back pain Heavy periods or spotting between periods Fatigue Some women with endometriosis do not have symptoms."
120,How are fallopian tubes damaged?,"Sometimes, the tubes may be blocked or they may be scarred as a result of disease or infection."

In this procedure, a surgeon inserts a small camera through a tube into your abdomen to check for abnormal endometrial tissue. Make sure your doctor knows that you are trying to conceive if you're being treated for endometriosis."
120,How does surgery help endomeriosis?,"In some women, surgery significantly improves their chances of getting pregnant.

121,What happens on the day of a proctoscopy?,"You'll probably get a proctoscopy in your doctor's office. You will remove your clothing below the waist and lie on your side on a table. The doctor will insert a gloved finger into your anus to check for tenderness or blockage. The doctor will then insert a lubricated proctoscope into your rectum and pump air in to expand the rectum. You may feel some fullness, like you need to pass a stool. Your doctor also may use special tools to remove growths or to take a sample of tissue -- called a biopsy -- for further testing. When the exam is over, your doctor will gently withdraw the scope. Most people don't need anesthesia for this procedure. You may feel some pressure or cramping while the scope is in place. But you should not feel any pain."

Other reactions to sulfa drugs include headache, trouble sleeping, cloudy urine (crystalluria), and low blood counts. Rarely, a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis happens."
122,What drugs should I avoid with sulfa allergies?,"Sulfa antibiotics have been widely used for more than 70 years. In fact, the first antibiotic was a sulfa drug introduced in 1936. Today, these drugs include burn creams, vaginal suppositories, and eye drops as well as medications for many types of infections. If you've had an allergic reaction to one sulfa antibiotic, you're probably allergic to all of them. Here are a few examples of common sulfa drugs that could cause problems: Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ( Bactrim, Sulfatrim): a sulfa combination drug that can be taken in liquid or pill form for many types of infections Sulfacetamide ( BLEPH-10): drops for eye infections Sulfadiazine silver ( Silvadene): cream to prevent and treat burn infections Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine): pills for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease Even if you're allergic to antibiotics that have sulfa, you might be able to take some other types of sulfa drugs without a reaction."
123,How common is pelvic organ prolapse (POP)?,"Nearly half of all women between ages 50 and 79 have at least a little bit of pelvic organ prolapse ( POP).

For instance, Kegel exercises can help strengthen the nerves and muscles in your pelvis. Making certain lifestyle changes might help, too. If you're overweight, for example, try to shed some pounds. Overweight women are more likely to get POP than those who maintain a healthy weight. Drink lots of fluids and eat high-fiber foods. This will help you to avoid constipation. Remember, constantly pushing and straining will only make the prolapse worse. Try not to lift anything heavy. If you must, learn to lift the right way --with your legs, not your back or abs. If you smoke, stop. Smoking increases your risk of POP. And see a doctor about any health issues you might have, like a cough that won't go away. Coughing puts pressure on your pelvic muscles and can make your prolapse worse."

Hold this warm compress to the area for 10 minutes to bring down swelling. Or, seep a tea bag in hot water and hold it on the area for 10 minutes. If the sores are on your buttocks, try a sitz bath. Run a few inches of warm water in the tub. Sit in the water for 10 to 15 minutes. Take an over-the-counter NSAID pain reliever, such as ibuprofen."
132,What are the symptoms of ???????tertiary syphilis?,"This is the final, most severe stage of syphilis. It can appear 10 to 30 years after the initial infection. You might experience permanent organ damage and death. Complications may include: Brain (neurological) problems Stroke Infection and inflammation of membranes around the brain and spinal cord Numbness Deafness Visual problems or blindness Personality changes Dementia Heart valve disease Aneurysm Inflammation of blood vessels You can pass this STD on to your unborn child or to your baby during childbirth."
132,What are the symptoms of syphilis in babies?,"Complications may include: Brain (neurological) problems Stroke Infection and inflammation of membranes around the brain and spinal cord Numbness Deafness Visual problems or blindness Personality changes Dementia Heart valve disease Aneurysm Inflammation of blood vessels You can pass this STD on to your unborn child or to your baby during childbirth. Doctors call this congenital syphilis. If not treated there is a high risk of stillbirth and infant death. Most babies born with syphilis have no symptoms. Some may have a rash on the palms of their hands or the soles of their feet. Eventually, babies can develop complications of many organs including: Enlarged liver Jaundice Discharge from nose Swollen glands Bone abnormalities Brain (neurological) problems See your child's pediatrician right away if she develops an unusual discharge, sore, or rash near her groin."
132,What are the symptoms of secondary syphilis?,"About 2 to 10 weeks after the first sore appears, you may develop the following: A skin rash that causes small, reddish-brown sores Sores in your mouth, vagina, or anus Fever Swollen glands Weight loss Hair loss Headache Extreme tiredness (fatigue) Muscle aches If you don't get treatment right away, your symptoms will go away only to come back. This could happen for up to a year. Even if your symptoms don't return, the infection is still alive in your body. Syphilis will get worse, and you can still infect your sexual partner."
132,What are the symptoms of latent syphilis?,"If you're not treated for secondary syphilis, the disease may progress to the latent (hidden) phase. Not everyone who has syphilis will go through this stage. If you do, you won't have any symptoms, maybe for years. In some cases, symptoms will never return. But the infection isn't gone; the bacteria remain dormant in the body. Some latent cases may progress to the tertiary stage of the disease."
132,What should I know about syphilis?,"What symptoms you have depends on which stage of the disease you're in. But the stages can overlap, and symptoms don't always develop in the same order. You could even be infected with this sexually transmitted disease ( STD) and not have any signs of it for years. The stages of syphilis are called âprimary,â âsecondary,â âlatent,â and âtertiary (late).â This article deals with the symptoms typical of each stage. You might not even know you have it."
132,What are the symptoms of primary syphilis?,"You might notice that the lymph nodes near your groin are enlarged. Typically, the first visible sign of syphilis is a small, painless sore (doctors call it a âchancreâ) on the skin (you may develop several sores). It normally appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. The sore won't hurt, and it may be hidden inside your rectum or vagina. You might not even know you have it. The sore will heal on its own in about 3 to 6 weeks. It means you're about to enter the second stage of syphilis. It can appear 10 to 30 years after the initial infection."
133,How can I tell if my cat is purring because of affection?,Kittens can purr when they're only a few days old. It's probably a way to let their mothers know where they are or that they're OK. Purring also helps a kitten bond with its mother. Mama cats use it like a lullaby.
133,How can I tell if my cat is purring because of relief and healing?,"Even though purring takes energy, many cats purr when they get hurt or are in pain. It might simply be a way for a cat to soothe itself, like a child sucks their thumb to feel better. The low frequency of purrs causes a series of related vibrations within their body that can: Heal bones and wounds Build muscle and repair tendons Ease breathing Lessen pain and swelling This might explain why cats are able to survive falls from high places and tend to have fewer complications after surgeries than dogs."
134,What are typical symptoms of migraine headaches?,"People who get migraines describe them as an intense pulsing or throbbing type of pain, often on one side of the head. Along with the pain they can also have symptoms like: Flashing lights or ""aura"" Nausea Sensitivity to light Vomiting When you have one, you may be unable to do your normal activities."
134,How do estrogen levels trigger migraines?,"These headaches are triggered by things like: Bright lights Foods or drinks Hunger Lack of sleep Stress Strong scents A drop in the female hormone, estrogen, can also set off migraines. That's why women who get migraines often have headaches right before their period, when estrogen levels are low. During pregnancy, estrogen levels rise, bringing many women a break from these headaches. But they often start up again after the baby is born."
134,What medicines relieve a migraine once it starts?,"Medicines that help prevent migraines from starting: Antidepressants: venlafaxine ( Effexor), amitriptyline ( Elavil) Anti-seizure drugs: divalproex sodium ( Depakote), topiramate ( Topamax), valproate sodium ( Depacon), valproic acid ( Depakene and Stavzor) Blood pressure medicines: beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers CGRP inhibitors: erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy), block the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide molecules Medicines that relieve a migraine once it has already started: Pain relievers: acetaminophen ( Panadol, Tylenol), aspirin, ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil), naproxen ( Aleve) Triptans: eletriptan ( Relpax), frovatriptan ( Frova), rizatriptan ( Maxalt), sumatriptan ( Alsuma, Imitrex, Treximet), zolmitriptan ( Zomig) For some women, taking the same female hormones used to treat menopause symptoms like hot flashes can also help prevent migraine pain."
134,What lifestyle changes can help with menopausal migraines?,"You have many options for relieving migraines. Sometimes a few simple lifestyle changes can help: Keep a diary of what you eat, and try to avoid foods that trigger your migraines. Some of these may include: aged cheese, chocolate, or artificial sweeteners. Eat meals at regular times. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Cut stress using relaxation methods such as deep breathing, exercise, or massage."
134,How often do women get migraines?,"Many people get migraines from time to time. But some, usually women, have them as often as 15 or more days each month."
134,Will menopause end migraine headaches?,"Once estrogen production stops and periods end, you may get a reprieve from your migraine pain. Sometimes, though, menopause doesn't spell the end of migraines."
134,If a women has her uterus or ovaries removed is she more likely to develop migraines during menopause?,Women who had their uterus and ovaries removed with surgery often have more of a problem with migraines than those who go into menopause naturally.
134,What medicines prevent migraines from starting?,"Medicines that help prevent migraines from starting: Antidepressants: venlafaxine ( Effexor), amitriptyline ( Elavil) Anti-seizure drugs: divalproex sodium ( Depakote), topiramate ( Topamax), valproate sodium ( Depacon), valproic acid ( Depakene and Stavzor) Blood pressure medicines: beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers CGRP inhibitors: erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy), block the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide molecules Medicines that relieve a migraine once it has already started: Pain relievers: acetaminophen ( Panadol, Tylenol), aspirin, ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil), naproxen ( Aleve) Triptans: eletriptan ( Relpax), frovatriptan ( Frova), rizatriptan ( Maxalt), sumatriptan ( Alsuma, Imitrex, Treximet), zolmitriptan ( Zomig) For some women, taking the same female hormones used to treat menopause symptoms like hot flashes can also help prevent migraine pain."
134,Can menopause cause migraines?,"If your migraines are tied to your menstrual cycle, they may become as unpredictable as your periods. Some women get migraines for the first time, or their headaches get more intense, in the years just before menopause. Others find that their migraines become less frequent and less intense."
134,Are there risks associated with using hormone replacement therapy to treat menopause migraines?,"HRT has been linked to greater risks of heart disease and breast cancer. Talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you. If so, ask for the lowest possible dose of hormones needed to control your symptoms. You can get the hormones through a patch or gel that you rub on your skin."
134,What lifestyle changes can treat menopause migraines?,"You have many options for relieving migraines. Sometimes a few simple lifestyle changes can help: Keep a diary of what you eat, and try to avoid foods that trigger your migraines.

Once estrogen production stops and periods end, you may get a reprieve from your migraine pain. Sometimes, though, menopause doesn't spell the end of migraines."
134,When should I talk to my doctor about menopause migraines?,You can also try medicines to relieve your headaches. Talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you.
134,Is there a link between female hormones and migraine headaches?,"That's one of the reasons why women are three times more likely to get migraines than men. For many women, menopause brings a welcome end to these headaches. But the hormonal changes leading up to menopause can sometimes make things worse before they get better. And some women find that the hormones make their headaches worse."
135,What causes an aneurysm?,Any condition that causes your artery walls to weaken can bring one on. The most common culprits are atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. Deep wounds and infections can also lead to an aneurysm. Or you may be born with weakness in one of your artery walls.
135,What is the serious threat of an aneurysm?,"The most serious threat of an aneurysm is that it will burst and cause a stroke or massive bleeding, which can be life-threatening. A large aneurysm can affect your circulation and lead to blood clots."
136,What's a healthy waist measurement?,"For your best health, your waist should be less than 40 inches around for men, and less than 35 inches for women. If it's larger than that, you may want to talk with your doctor about what your next steps are, including losing weight."
136,How do you measure your waist?,"Start at the top of your hip bone, then bring the tape measure all the way around your body, level with your belly button. Make sure it's not too tight and that it's straight, even at the back. Don't hold your breath while measuring. Check the number on the tape measure right after you exhale."
137,What are serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for depression?,"Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) affect the action of both serotonin and another brain chemical, norepinephrine. This class includes desvenlafaxine ( Khedezla or Pristiq), duloxetine ( Cymbalta), levomilnacipran ( Fetzima), and or venlafaxine ( Effexor). Side effects are usually mild. They include upset stomach, sleep problems, sexual problems, headache, anxiety, and dizziness, and weakness."
137,What drugs other than antidepressants may help treat depression?,"For instance, some people recovering from depression will benefit from drugs for anxiety or insomnia. In addition, certain atypical antipsychotics -- (primarily used for schizophrenia or bibolar disorder) such as aripiprazole ( Abilify), brexipipzole ( Rexulti) or ( Seroquel XR) -- have been shown to enhance the effect of antidepressant medicines for depression when an antidepressant alone isn't fully effective. While not classified as a medication by the FDA, l-methylfolate ( Deplin) has proven successful in treating depression. Considered a medical food or nutriceutical, it is a prescription strength form of the vitamin B known asfolate and helps regulate the neurotransmitters that control moods."
137,How can norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) help with  depression?,"Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors ( NDRIs) affect norepinephrine and a different chemical in the brain, dopamine. This class of drugs includes bupropion ( Wellbutrin). Side effects are usually mild, and include upset stomach, headache, sleep problems, tremor, and anxiety. Wellbutrin may be less likely to cause sexual side effects or weight gain than other antidepressants."
137,How can noradnergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs) help with  depression?,"Noradnergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants ( Na SSAs) also affect serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain. This class of drugs includes mirtazpine ( Remeron). Side effects are usually mild, and include upset stomach, sleepiness, weight gain, anxiety, and dizziness."
137,How can you find the right depression medicine for you?,"You may even find that a medicine that used to help just doesn't anymore. You may have to put up with some trial and error. While antidepressants usually begin to show significant effects within a few weeks, it can take several months before you feel the full effects of a new drug, so don't give up. Over time, your doctor may want to increase or decrease the dose, depending on how you're doing. If you've given a depression drug a chance and it still isn't helping, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you try another antidepressant. With time, you should be able to find a medicine or a combination of medicines that helps. Don't ever stop taking a medicine without your doctor's approval, even if you're feeling better."
137,How can selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) help with depression?,"Newer Antidepressants. This class of antidepressants include citalopram ( Celexa), escitalopram ( Lexapro ), fluoxetine ( Prozac ), fluvoxamine ( Luvox), paroxetine ( Paxil), sertraline ( Zoloft). They include upset stomach, sleep problems, sexual problems, headache, anxiety, and dizziness, and weakness."
137,What do you need to know about medications for depression?,"But these drugs don't cure depression in the way that antibiotics cure infections. Instead, they can help ease the symptoms. You will probably need to continue medication even after you feel better. This helps reduce the risk of relapse. Depression can sometimes be like other chronic illnesses, like diabetes or heart disease, that need ongoing treatment. However, they are still the right choice for some people with depression -- especially if newer antidepressants don't help."
138,Can you prevent genital herpes?,"The only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. Short of that, a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. Remember, you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. Likewise, you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. If you know that a sex partner has genital herpes, you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. Nevertheless, genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms, so you should always use a latex barrier, such as a condom or a dental dam."
138,Is there a cure for genital herpes?,Genital herpes is a lifelong condition for which there is no cure.
138,Is there a test for genital herpes?,"The blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. HSV-2 almost always infects the genitals, so if antibodies to HSV-2 are detected in the blood, you probably have genital herpes. A blood test that shows antibodies to HSV-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. That's because oral herpes, typically caused by HSV-1, can be spread to the genitals during oral sex. Studies are under way to investigate medicated gel products that can be placed in the vagina to reduce the transmission of herpes and HIV."
139,What is an erection?,"An erection starts in your brain. Something you saw, felt, smelled, heard, or thought makes your nerves send chemical messages to the blood vessels in your penis. The arteries relax and open up to let more blood to flow in; at the same time, the veins close up. Once blood is in the penis, pressure traps it within the corpora cavernosa. Your penis expands and holds the erection."
139,What is ejaculation?,"When you're aroused, tubes called the vas deferens squeeze sperm from the testes toward the back of the urethra. The seminal vesicles also release fluid there. The urethra senses the sperm and fluid mixture. Then, at the height of sexual excitement, it sends signals to your spinal cord, which in turn sends signals to the muscles at the base of your penis. These contract powerfully and quickly, every 0.8 seconds. This forces the semen out of the penis as you climax."
139,What is the anatomy of a penis?,"The head or glans is at the end of the shaft. The opening at the tip of the head, where urine and semen come out, is called the meatus. They have a maze of blood vessels, tissue, and open pockets. The urethra, the tube that urine and semen flow through, runs along the underside of them, in the spongy tissue of the corpus spongiosum. Two main arteries (one in each of the corpora cavernosa) and several veins move blood in and out. Nerves relay messages to and from other parts of your body. Once blood is in the penis, pressure traps it within the corpora cavernosa."
140,What types of liver cancers are there?,"Because the liver is made up of several different types of cells, several types of tumors can form there. Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. The outlook for health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have."
140,What are some other risk factors for liver cancer?,"Other risk factors for liver cancer may include: Your sex. Men are more likely to get hepatocellular carcinoma than women. Your weight. Obesity can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Your race. In the U. S., liver cancer is most common in Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Anabolic steroid use. Male hormonesabused by athletes to increase muscle can slightly increase liver cancer risk with long-term use. History of diabetes. Studies have suggested a link between diabetes and liver cancer. This is likely due to the link between diabetes and fatty liver disease. Inherited metabolic diseases. Diseases that disrupt the normal metabolism of the body have been shown to increase your risk of liver cancer. Rare diseases. Studies have found a link between liver cancer and some rare diseases like alpha -1-antitrypsin deficiency, tyrosinemia, and Wilson's disease."
140,What kind of tumors can form in the liver?,"Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. The outlook for health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have. The more common benign tumors of the liver include: Hemangioma Hepatic adenoma Focal nodular hyperplasia Cysts Lipoma Fibroma Leiomyoma None of these tumors are treated like liver cancer."
140,Which liver tumors are cancerous?,Liver cancers include: Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) Cholangiocarcinoma ( These are really cancers of the bile duct.
140,What does the liver do?,"Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver."
140,What increases risk for liver cancer?,"Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Aflatoxins, cancer-causing substances made by a type of plant mold, have also been implicated. Aflatoxins can contaminate wheat, peanuts, rice, corn, and soybeans. These are rare problems in most developed countries like the U. S. Other causes include the hormones androgen and estrogen and a dye formerly used in medical tests called thorotrast."
140,What is primary liver cancer and how common is it?,"Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver. Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic, meaning it started elsewhere in the body. Primary liver cancer, which starts in the liver, accounts for about 2% of cancers in the U. S., but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries. This is mainly due to the prevalence of hepatitis, caused by contagious viruses, that predisposes a person to liver cancer. In the U. S., primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women, at an average age of 67."
140,What are the risk factors for liver cancer?,"Other risk factors for liver cancer may include: Your sex. Men are more likely to get hepatocellular carcinoma than women. Your weight. Obesity can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Your race. In the U. S., liver cancer is most common in Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Anabolic steroid use.

140,Which liver tumors are benign?,These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. They will not be discussed in this article.)
141,How can the severity of fractures vary?,An oblique fracture is when the break is on an angle through the bone A pathologic fracture is caused by a disease that weakens the bone A stress fracture is a hairline crack The severity of a fracture depends upon the fracture subtype and location. Serious fractures can have dangerous complications if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or surrounding tissue. Recuperation time varies depending on the age and health of the patient and the type of fracture. A minor fracture in a child may heal within a few weeks; a serious fracture in an older person may take months to heal.
141,What are fractures?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Fractures are common; the average person has two during a lifetime. They occur when the physical force exerted on the bone is stronger than the bone itself. For example: A greenstick fracture in which the bone is bent, but not broken all the way through A buckle fracture results from compression of two bones driven into each other."
142,What kind of doctor should I see if I can't see a rheumatologist for my rheumatoid arthritis?,"If you can't see a rheumatologist for all your RA care, look for one who will partner with your regular doctor. You'll still need to see the rheumatologist once in a while, but your primary care doctor may handle your day-to-day treatment. If it's not possible to see a rheumatologist at all, look for a primary care doctor who treats many people with RA and ask if they can work with a rheumatologist remotely."
142,What questions should I ask my doctor about rheumatoid arthritis?,"Key things to know about your doctor include: Are they part of a group, or do they work on their own? Can I see the doctor of my choice in the practice, or must I see the first available doctor? How long is the average wait for an appointment? Does the office offer evening or weekend appointments?"
142,Is it best to see a rheumatologist if I have arthritis?,"If your doctor doesn't have all the traits you'd like, tell them how you feel and ask for what you need. If you're still unhappy, look for another doctor."
142,Why do I need to be comfortable talking to my doctor about rheumatoid arthritis?,"It's simple: You need to be able to tell your doctor what's going on, and she should be able to communicate clearly to support you. Your doctor should also help you better understand your RA, what to expect from treatment, and what complementary treatments might help or hurt your condition."
143,What should you do if you missed two birth control pills?,"If you don't remember until the next day, go ahead and take 2 pills that day. If you forget to take your pills for 2 days, take 2 pills the day you remember and 2 pills the next day. You will then be back on schedule."
143,What should you do if you missed one birth control pill?,"If you forget to take your pills for 2 days, take 2 pills the day you remember and 2 pills the next day."
143,Should you use another form of birth control if you forgot to take a birth control pill,"Any time you forget to take a pill, you must use another form of birth control until you finish the pill pack. When you forget to take a birth control pill, you increase the chance of releasing an egg from your ovary."
143,What happens if you forget to take your placebo pills for birth control?,"But if you forget to take any of the last 7 (or last 4 of a 4-pill placebo pack or last 2 of a 2-pill placebo pack) out of the 28 day pills, you will not raise your chance of pregnancy, because these pills contain only inactive ingredients. Some pill packs don't have any placebo pills, so it's best to take all of your pills on schedule so you can stay on track."
143,What should you do if you miss your period and forgot to take a birth control pill?,"If you miss more than 2 birth control pills, call your doctor for instructions. Many women do not have a period on low-dose birth control pills even if they don't miss any pills. This is normal, so don't be concerned -- but do take the test to be sure."
143,What should you do if you missed more than two birth control pills?,"You may need to take one pill daily until Sunday and then start a new pack. Or you might need to throw out the rest of the pill pack and start over with a new pack that same day. If you miss your period and have forgotten to take one or more pills, get a pregnancy test."
144,What should you know about allergic asthma triggers?,"If your child has allergic asthma and inhales one of his triggers, that can launch an attack, making him cough, wheeze, and have trouble breathing. It's best to know what your child's triggers are so you can help him avoid them altogether or at least keep them far, far away. Each person has their own set of asthma triggers, but there are some common ones you can watch for."
144,How should you watch for smoke as a trigger for allergic asthma?,"There are a million good reasons to keep yourself and your child away from tobacco smoke, and allergic asthma is one of them. Secondhand smoke is extra toxic to young children because their lungs aren't mature yet. Make sure no one smokes in your home or your car. Other types of smoke, such as from wood-burning stoves, can also make asthma worse. If you can, avoid wood fires, inside and outside."
144,How should you watch for cockroaches as a trigger for allergic asthma?,"These pests are everywhere but are most common in cities and in southern U. S. states. They eat and drink the same things you do: water and leftovers. But they (and their droppings) can trigger asthma flares. To prevent them, keep food stored in the fridge or in an airtight container, wash dishes right after you use them, sweep up any crumbs, and plug any holes or cracks that let cockroaches get inside. You can also set out traps. If you see any roach droppings, sweep them up right away and put them in the trash. And keep a lid on your trash can inside and take it out often."
144,How should you watch for dust mites as a trigger for allergic asthma?,"There's not much you can do about shedding dead skin, but you can work to keep dust mites from bothering your family. Wash any bed linens that you can at least once a week in hot water, then put them in a hot dryer. Wash stuffed toys the same way. There are also special covers for mattresses and pillows. If you can, trade in carpets, rugs, and fabric furniture for wood, vinyl, and other smooth surfaces. These pests are everywhere but are most common in cities and in southern U. S. states."
144,How should you watch for mold as a trigger for allergic asthma?,"But they (and their droppings) can trigger asthma flares. Outside, it thrives in soil and plant debris, which doesn't really pose a health problem. Inside, mold is a hazard, lurking in damp places like basements, the kitchen sink, and anywhere you have leaks or standing water. Your best defense is to get rid of as much moisture as possible from your home. Clean up any mold you can see, use exhaust fans when you're in the shower, and run a dehumidifier or air conditioner. A drier house will also cut down on roaches and mites."
144,How should you watch for pollen as a trigger for allergic asthma?,"But the fur and feathers aren't the problem. ( Climate change also means that pollen seasons can last longer than they used to.) Thunderstorms can also cause plants to release their pollen. Keep an eye on local weather forecasts and pollen counts, and have your child stay indoors on days when the counts are high."
144,How should you watch for smells as a trigger for allergic asthma?,"It's both an indoor and outdoor trigger for allergic asthma. This includes cleaning agents with chlorine, scented candles, incense, hairspray, air fresheners, deodorants and perfumes, paint, and pesticides. Look for fragrance-free personal care products. If you need to use paint or pesticides, make sure your child is not nearby."
145,How is pain for most ankle injuries controlled?,"For most ankle injuries, pain is controlled by using an over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen. The specific treatment of the injury depends on the type of injury."
145,Can you put weight on ankle after it has been injured,"It is important not to put any weight on the ankle until after it's been evaluated by a doctor, which should be done as soon as possible. Fractures and sprains that are ignored or aren't treated properly can lead to long-term chronic problems with the ankle, such as repeated injury, ankle weakness, and arthritis."
145,What is an ankle fracture versus an ankle sprain?,A fracture describes a break in one or more of the bones. A sprain is the term that describes damage to ligaments when they are stretched beyond their normal range of motion. A ligament sprain can range from many microscopic tears in the fibers that comprise the ligament to a complete tear or rupture. A strain refers to damage to muscles and tendons as a result of being pulled or stretched too far.
145,What are ankle injuries?,"Sprains, Strains, and Fractures Ankle injuries are defined by the kind of tissue -- bone, ligament, or tendon -- that's damaged. The ankle is where three bones meet -- the tibia and fibula of your lower leg with the talus of your foot. These bones are held together at the ankle joint by ligaments, which are strong elastic bands of connective tissue that keep the bones in place while allowing normal ankle motion. Tendons attach muscles to the bones to do the work of making the ankle and foot move, and help keep the joints stable."
145,What does the overall treatment process of an ankle sprain look like?,"On average, the initial treatment of a sprain, includes resting, and protecting the ankle until swelling goes down for about one week. That's followed by a period of one to two weeks of exercise to restore range of motion, strength, and flexibility. It can take several more weeks to several months to gradually return to your normal activities while you continue to exercise."
145,How long do bones take to heal after an ankle break?,"It's important to rest the ankle to prevent further damage and keep weight off of it. Elevating the injured ankle to at least the level of your heart will reduce swelling and pain. Ligaments and tendons can take longer to heal after a fracture is fully mended. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full painfree motion and strength after an ankle fracture, although most people are able to resume their normal daily routine within three to four months. After the doctor has determined it is safe for you to start moving your ankle, you may need physical therapy to provide gait training, balance, strengthening, and mobility exercises. The therapist will develop a home program that you can use to regain your previous normal function. It can take several months to return to a normal walking pattern without limping."
145,How do you treat tendon injuries?,"Sprains, Strains, and Fractures Ankle injuries are defined by the kind of tissue -- bone, ligament, or tendon -- that's damaged. They include: Immobilization using a cast or splint Oral or injected anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain Physical therapy for range of motion, strength, and balance A brace to provide support during activities Surgery to repair the tendon or tendons and sometimes to repair the supporting structures of the foot The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following steps for reducing your risk of an ankle injury: Avoid exercising or playing sports when you are tired or in pain."
145,What are symptoms of tendinosis?,"Symptoms include: Sporadic pain on the outside of the ankle Weakness or instability in the ankle An increase in the height of the foot's arch With the subluxation you will notice ankle instability or weakness. You also may notice sporadic pain behind the outside ankle bone and a ""snapping"" feeling around the ankle bone. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full painfree motion and strength after an ankle fracture, although most people are able to resume their normal daily routine within three to four months."
145,Who is most likely to get ankle injuries?,"However, men between 15 and 24 years old have higher rates of ankle sprain, compared to women older than age 30 who have higher rates than men. Half of all ankle sprains occur during an athletic activity. Every day in the U. S., 25,000 people sprain their ankle. And more than 1 million people visit emergency rooms each year because of ankle injuries. The most common ankle injuries are sprains and fractures, which involve ligaments and bones in the ankle. But you can also tear or strain a tendon. The doctor may order an ankle X-ray to determine whether there are any broken bones."
145,Are fractures treated surgically or nonsurgically?,"If the sprain is mild, the swelling and pain may be slight. Typically the doctor will do this by putting on a brace that works as a splint or by putting on a cast. If the ankle is unstable, the fracture will be treated surgically. Often, the ankle is made stable by using a metal plate and screws to hold the bones in place. Following the surgery, the ankle is protected with a splint until the swelling goes down and then with a cast."
145,How do you treat mild ankle sprains?,"If the sprain is mild, the swelling and pain may be slight. With a mild sprain, you won't need a splint or a cast. Your doctor will tell you to put weight on the ankle fairly soon -- within one to three days -- as long as you can tolerate it and will prescribe range of motion, stretching, and strengthening exercises."
146,What are some questions I should ask my doctor about my skin allergy?,"Do I need allergy testing? Should I see a specialist? What will make my rash feel better? Will it go away? Can I use over-the-counter medications, or do I need prescription drugs? If I need medicine, what are the possible side effects? Are there things I should avoid? Can I take something to prevent an allergic reaction? Are there other treatments that could help? Should I be worried about an allergic emergency? What should I watch for? Do I need to be concerned about other allergies?"
147,Can physical problems of the uterus cause abnormal uterine bleeding?,Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. And a condition called adenomyosis causes the endometrium to grow into the tissue of the uterus.
147,How do NSAIDs treat abnormal uterine bleeding?,"If you take anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or naproxen a few days before your period starts, they may help lighten the bleeding."
147,Can abnormal uterine bleeding be diagnosed with a hysteroscopy?,Hysteroscopy: Your doctor will look inside your uterus with a tiny lighted scope that they put in through your cervix.

147,Can abnormal uterine bleeding be diagnosed with a biopsy?,Biopsy: Your doctor may take out a small piece of tissue so it can be checked under a microscope for abnormal cells.
147,What is endometrial ablation?,"This uses heat, cold, electricity, or a laser to destroy the lining of the uterus. It may end your periods entirely. You probably won't be able to get pregnant after having it done, but it can be very dangerous if you do. You'll need to use birth control until menopause."
147,What is a myomectomy or uterine artery embolization?,It can also show if your hormones are out of balance or if you have a blood disorder or chronic disease.
147,What things can throw off your hormones and lead to abnormal uterine bleeding?,"These things can throw off your hormones, too: Birth control pills and other medicines Fast weight loss or gain Emotional or physical stress An intrauterine device ( IUD) Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus."
147,Can abnormal uterine bleeding be diagnosed with blood work?,"You'll probably get a pregnancy test, and you may also have: Blood work: Heavy bleeding can leave your body short of iron. A blood test can see if that's a problem for you. It can also show if your hormones are out of balance or if you have a blood disorder or chronic disease."
147,What causes abnormal uterine bleeding?,"Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation), certain hormones tell your body to build up then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium). With teenagers and women who are getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much, and that can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods."
147,How does tranexamic acid treat abnormal uterine bleeding?,This is when your uterus is taken out.
147,Do doctors look at how long you get your period when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding?,"How long it lasts: A typical period lasts 4 or 5 days. If yours is often less than 2 days or longer than a week, that could mean something's wrong."
147,How do hormones treat abnormal uterine bleeding?,Birth control pills and other hormone treatments may be able to give you regular menstrual cycles and lighter periods.
147,How do you treat abnormal uterine bleeding?,"This will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding -- if a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Your treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you're close to menopause, your doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own."
147,How do gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) treat abnormal uterine bleeding?,"When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation), certain hormones tell your body to build up then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium). It's not used that often, but it can help spot adenomyosis."
147,What is abnormal uterine bleeding?,"If it's so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated.

148,Is it easy to diagnose multiple sclerosis?,It can be a challenge for doctors to diagnose multiple sclerosis ( MS). There's no single test that can prove you have it.
148,Are electrical tests used to diagnose multiple sclerosis?,"Evoked potentials: These electrical nerve tests can help doctors confirm if MS has affected the parts of your brain that help you see, hear, and feel. The doctor will place wires on your scalp to test your brain's response as you watch a pattern on a video screen, hear a series of clicks, or get electrical pulses on your arm or leg."

148,Does a normal MRI confirm that I do not have multiple sclerosis?,"Also, an MRI result that says things are normal doesn't rule out MS. You could be one of a small number of people who have lesions in places the scan can't show."
148,What does an MRI show?,"They can see changes caused by multiple sclerosis like signs of inflammation in the deep parts of your brain or spinal cord. But older people or those with high blood pressure and diabetes also can have the same kinds of spots on a brain MRI. So the doctor will consider other info, including your symptoms, along with the scan results before they make a diagnosis."
148,Will you need a spinal tap for multiple sclerosis?,"They'll ask how you're feeling and help you figure out if your symptoms mean you have MS or another problem. Doctors use it to look for high levels of proteins and other substances that are signs of the disease. It can help diagnose MS, but it, too, isn't absolute proof."
148,What should I do after a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis?,"It can be a challenge for doctors to diagnose multiple sclerosis ( MS). If you've been waiting years or months, the news might be a relief. Either way, you'll have concerns about what the disease means for your life and your family. That's completely understandable. Talk with others -- your friends, your doctor, a support group, or a counselor -- about your feelings. Your health care team can help you decide the best ways to treat your disease and live with it day to day. MS affects everyone differently, so what works for one person with the condition may not be what's best for you."
148,What tests will my doctor perform to diagnose multiple sclerosis?,"Your doctor will need to: Find damage to at least two areas of your central nervous system (your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves) Prove the damage happened at different points in time Rule out any other diagnosis The doctor will start by asking you about your medical history and your symptoms. They'll also do a few tests to see if your brain and spinal cord are working as they should. Spinal taps: This test, which you may also hear called lumbar puncture, checks the fluid that runs through your spinal column."

149,Where is precision medicine most used currently?,"Where precision medicine is starting to make a difference is in the treatment of some cancers. Researchers are beginning to change how they classify tumors. The genetics of some breast cancers, for instance, may be more like stomach tumors than other breast cancers. With precision medicine, cancers that are genetically alike are treated similarly. For example, doctors know a drug called Gleevec (imatinib) works to treat leukemia only when the cancer cells have one particular genetic makeup. So, rather than treat everyone with leukemia using Gleevec, doctors test people for that specific genetic mix and give the drug only to those who have it. They're using the same approach to decide which meds people take for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, as well as melanoma."
149,Is precision medicine based on genetics?,"Or a drug may work against only part of a tumor, which lets the remaining part continue to grow. These could include: The perfect diet for you -- and only you Tests to find the bacteria in your digestive system Blood samples to count your immune cells Real-time tracking of your blood sugar levels, heartbeat, or blood pressure Anything that can give doctors a better sense of you as an individual has the potential to help them figure out how to make you healthier."
149,Why is precision medicine needed?,"Picture this: You get detailed tests that can gauge how your arthritis or cancer differs from someone else's. Then you get a treatment that's tailored to you, rather than to anyone else. To test all this out, researchers are turning to something called âbasket trials.â The âbasketâ is based on the genetics of your cancer, not where it is in your body. The treatment they receive is based on the genetics of their tumor."

When the saved stem cells get put back into their bodies, they start making new immune cells that hopefully won't go after myelin and brain tissue."
175,Are hookworms effective in treating multiple sclerosis?,"Hookworms are tiny worms that can live in your small intestine and cause problems with your gut, including pain, diarrhea, and anemia. These intestinal parasites might also be able to stop the immune system from overreacting. One small study of 12 people with MS found that those who were infected with hookworms had fewer lesions than those who weren't infected. In 2012, researchers in the UK began recruiting people with MS for a study to see if hookworms could alter the course of MS. Watch for results in the next several years."

You might have a test done if you: Are about to have an organ transplant Have a weakened immune system Are going to begin a drug that lowers your immune system Doctors use two types of tests to diagnose chickenpox or shingles: Antibody: When you're exposed to varicella zoster, your immune system makes proteins to fight it. Your doctor can look for these proteins, called antibodies, in a sample of your blood. Your doctor can collect samples from scabs from blisters that have crusted over. Your doctor should have the results in 1 to 3 days. You might need to have a second test if the results aren't clear. Your symptoms and test results will show whether you have shingles. Once you've been diagnosed, you can start on treatment to help you feel better."

199,How is a peritonsillar abscess usually diagnosed?,"A peritonsillar abscess is easy to diagnose when it is large enough to see. The doctor will look into your mouth using a light and, possibly, a tongue depressor. Swelling and redness on one side of the throat near the tonsil suggests an abscess. The doctor may also gently push on the area with a gloved finger to see if there is pus from infection inside."
199,What is a peritonsillar abscess?,"An abscess is a collection of pus that forms near an area of infected skin or other soft tissue. The abscess can cause pain, swelling, and, if severe, blockage of the throat. If the throat is blocked, swallowing, speaking, and even breathing become difficult. These conditions may include the following: Epiglottitis, an inflammation of the epiglottis (the flap of tissue that prevents food from entering the windpipe) Retropharyngeal abscess, a pocket of pus that forms behind the soft tissue in the back of the throat (like a peritonsillar abscess but in a different location) Peritonsillar cellulitis, an infection of the soft tissue itself (a peritonsillar abscess forms beneath the surface of the tissue) Your doctor may test you for mononucleosis, a virus."

202,How is an esophageal pH test done?,"The equipment used in the esophageal p H test consists of a small probe that is inserted through your nostril and positioned near the lower esophagus. The probe is plugged into a small unit (or monitor) worn on your belt or over your shoulder. A newer, wireless device may make monitoring the p H level easier: Instead of having to have a tube placed down your nose for 24 hours, your doctor will place a disposable capsule into the esophagus using an endoscope. The capsule then wirelessly transmits information for up to 48 hours to a receiver worn around the waist."

203,What problems can you get from crooked teeth and misaligned bites?,"Crooked teeth and misaligned bites can: Interfere with proper chewing. Make keeping teeth clean more of a challenge, increasing the risk of tooth decay, cavities, and gingivitis. Strain the teeth, jaws, and muscles, increasing the risk of breaking a tooth. Make people feel self-conscious about their appearance and affect their self-esteem."
203,What causes crooked teeth?,"There are several reasons why some people's teeth grow in crooked, overlapping, or twisted. Some people's mouths are too small for their teeth, which crowds the teeth and causes them to shift. In other cases, a person's upper and lower jaws aren't the same size or are malformed, resulting in either an overbite, when there is excessive protrusion of the upper jaw, or an under bite, when the lower jaw protrudes forward causing the lower jaw and teeth to extend out beyond the upper teeth."
203,What causes misaligned bites or crooked teeth?,"Most often crooked teeth, overbites, and underbites are inherited traits just as the color of your eyes or size of your hands. Other causes of misaligned bites are early loss of baby or adult teeth; improper fit of dental restorations (for example, fillings or crowns); gingivitis (gum disease); undue pressure on the teeth and gums; misalignment of the jaw after an injury; tumors of the mouth or jaw; or common oral health problems in children such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond the age of three, or prolonged use of a bottle."

204,Why do certain foods cause lung cancer?,"Experts aren't exactly sure why a high-glycemic diet may be connected with lung cancer. One possible reason is that it raises your blood sugar, which increases levels of proteins called insulin-like growth factors. Earlier studies suggest they may play a role in the development of the disease."
204,How can genes play a role in getting lung cancer?,"Sometimes changes to the DNA of your lung cells, known as ""mutations,"" can lead to cancer. Or you may naturally have less of an ability to clear away chemicals from your body that can cause the disease."
204,What are some things that can bring on lung cancer for non-smokers?,"There are two types: the stuff a smoker breathes out and the cloud that drifts from a cigarette, pipe, or cigar. Both are bad for you. So even if you wouldn't dream of lighting up a cigarette, you still take in harmful chemicals when you're around someone who does. There are at least 70 kinds in secondhand smoke that can lead to cancer. There are no safe amounts, so try to avoid secondhand smoke as much as you can.

206,Is the bird flu going to be the next flu pandemic?,"While experts say it's inevitable that sooner or later we'll see another flu pandemic, it's by no means certain that the current bird flu virus will be the cause. Even if a new human flu emerges, public health officials might be able to contain it. H5 N1 is susceptible to the newer flu drugs. And a vaccine already has been created and stockpiled by the World Health Organization."
206,How could the bird flu become airborne or more of a risk to humans?,"If a person -- or a susceptible animal -- gets infected with bird flu and human flu at the same time, the bird and human flu viruses could swap genes. Even without swapping genes, H5 N1 could mutate into a form that more easily infects humans. The lab-created H5 N1 mutants remain in high-security labs. But the mutations needed to make H5 N1 an airborne, human virus already exist in H5 N1 viruses seen in nature. So far, the full set of mutations has not appeared in the same virus."
206,What is the bird flu?,"Currently, a particularly deadly strain of bird flu -- H5 N1 -- continues to spread among poultry in Egypt and in certain parts of Asia. People catch bird flu by close contact with birds or bird droppings."

Urinalysis can be part of a pregnancy checkup, too."
207,What is a urinalysis?,"Other names for it are urine test, urine analysis, and UA. You may have a urinalysis as part of a routine check of your overall health, for instance as part of an annual physical. There are three ways to analyze urine, and your test might use all of them."
207,What does a dipstick urinalysis check for?,"Some of the things that shouldn't be in your urine that a microscope can find include: Red blood cells White blood cells Bacteria Crystals (clumps of minerals â a possible sign of kidney stones) The third part of urinalysis is the dipstick test, which uses a thin plastic strip treated with chemicals. It's dipped into your urine, and the chemicals on the stick react and change color if levels are above normal. Things the dipstick test can check for include: Acidity, or p H. If the acid is abnormal, you could have kidney stones, a urinary tract infection ( UTI) or another condition. Protein. This can be a sign your kidneys are not working right. Kidneys filter waste products out of your blood. Glucose. A high sugar content is a marker for diabetes. White blood cells. These are a sign of infection or inflammation, either in the kidneys or anywhere else along urinary tract. If this waste product, which is normally eliminated by your liver, shows up, it may mean your liver isn't working properly. Blood in your urine. Sometimes this is a sign of infections or certain illnesses."

But if you're in general good health, you don't have to worry. They rarely cause an infection. Women with a weakened immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- are most at risk. You can sometimes pick up this infection during sex. The bacteria can also pass from a mother to her baby during childbirth."
232,What is mycoplasma pneumoniae?,"There are about 200 types of mycoplasma bacteria, but most of them are harmless. The ones you may have to worry about are: Mycoplasma pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma hominis Ureaplasma urealyticum Ureaplasma parvum This type causes lung infections. About a third of people who get infected come down with a mild form of pneumonia called ""walking pneumonia."" Most people, especially children, will get ""tracheobronchitis,"" a fancy name for a chest cold. You can catch one of these infections when someone who is sick coughs or sneezes and sends droplets with the bacteria into the air."
232,What does it mean if I have a mycoplasma infection?,"They're caused by tiny living things called bacteria. Unlike other bacteria, the ones that lead to mycoplasma infections don't have cell walls. That's important because many antibiotics kill bacteria by weakening those walls. Since mycoplasma bacteria don't have them, some antibiotics, like penicillin, won't work against them. There are about 200 types of mycoplasma bacteria, but most of them are harmless."
232,How does my doctor diagnose ureaplasma infection?,"Most healthy women have these bacteria in their cervix or vagina, and a smaller number of men also have them in their urethra. Problems in newborn babies can include: Low birth weight Pneumonia Bacteria in the blood, called septicemia To diagnose a ureaplasma infection, your doctor can take a sample of fluid from: Blood Amniotic fluid Placental tissue Cervix Urethra Your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection."
232,How do I treat mycoplasma genitalium?,"If you're infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, you may get symptoms like: Sore throat Cough Fever Fatigue Headache To treat your infection, your doctor may suggest one of these types of antibiotics: Fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin or erythromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline You get this if you have sex with someone who's infected. For treatment, you may need to take one of these types of antibiotics: Fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline Your partner may need to get treated, too. There's a little bit of trial and error when you take these meds, because sometimes the bacteria don't respond to them. If the first drug doesn't work, your doctor can prescribe a different one. You can help prevent Mycoplasma genitalium if you use a condom during sex. To find out if you have an infection caused by this type of bacteria, your doctor will test a sample of fluid from your vagina or urethra."
232,What antibiotics will the doctor prescribe if I'm infected with ureaplasma urealyticum or ureaplasma parvum?,"To find out if you have an infection caused by this type of bacteria, your doctor will test a sample of fluid from your vagina or urethra. Most healthy women have these bacteria in their cervix or vagina, and a smaller number of men also have them in their urethra. Choices may include: Fluoroquinolones like moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline If you were infected while pregnant, your newborn baby may also need to get antibiotics."

To find out if you have an infection caused by this type of bacteria, your doctor will test a sample of fluid from your vagina or urethra. If you do, you'll get treated with antibiotics such as one in the tetracycline family, like doxycycline. To help keep this infection away, always use a condom during sex. And limit how many partners you have."

232,"What are ureaplasma urealyticum and ureaplasma parvum, and how does a person get infected?","These bacteria live in the urinary tract and genitals of about half of all women and fewer men. Normally, they don't cause any problems. Ureaplasma can spread during sex. If you're pregnant and you're infected, you can pass the bacteria to your baby in the womb or during childbirth."
232,What are the symptoms of mycoplasma genitalium in women?,"If you're infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, you may get symptoms like: Sore throat Cough Fever Fatigue Headache To treat your infection, your doctor may suggest one of these types of antibiotics: Fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin or erythromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline You get this if you have sex with someone who's infected. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you're a woman, you may notice that you: Have pain during sex Bleed from the vagina after sex Get a discharge from the vagina If you're a man, the infection can cause: Urethritis -- a swelling of the urethra, the tube that urine goes through as it leaves the body Stinging or burning when you pee Discharge from the penis To find out if you're infected, your doctor may do a test called NAAT to look for the bacteria's genes. To find out if you have an infection caused by this type of bacteria, your doctor will test a sample of fluid from your vagina or urethra."
232,What are some symptoms of ureaplasma urealyticum and ureaplasma parvum infection?,"These bacteria live in the urinary tract and genitals of about half of all women and fewer men.

233,What symptoms of chemical pneumonia need emergency medical care?,Immediate evaluation in a hospital's emergency department is necessary for treating the following conditions: Unconsciousness Cyanosis -- A blue discoloration of the mouth or skin Difficulty breathing Sudden change of voice Mouth or throat swelling Chest pain Shortness of breath Cough productive of frothy or bloody spit Altered thinking and reasoning skills Exposure to potentially deadly chemical Vomiting and aspiration The poison control center may suggest other conditions particular to the chemical that would need emergency care.
233,What should you do if you have any symptoms of chemical pneumonia?,"You can call your local poison control center for help. If your symptoms are serious, you will want immediate treatment at a hospital."
233,What types of substances can cause chemical pneumonia?,"Many substances can cause chemical pneumonia, including liquids, gases, and small particles, such as dust or fumes, also called particulate matter."
233,What are the treatments for chemical pneumonia?,"In chemical pneumonia, inflammation of lung tissue is from poisons or toxins. Frequently, the symptoms will be mild, the chemical will be well known, and the medical evaluation brief and focused. Many treatments are possible, including the following: IV fluids Oxygen by mask or tube Breathing treatment with medicine to open breathing tubes Steroid medications by IV or mouth Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by mouth Pain medications by IV or mouth Artificial ventilation (help breathing) Preventive antibiotics (sometimes) Prognosis depends on the chemical exposure and person's medical condition."
233,What is chemical pneumonia?,"Pneumonia usually is caused by a bacteria or virus. In chemical pneumonia, inflammation of lung tissue is from poisons or toxins. Only a small percentage of pneumonias are caused by chemicals. Chemical pneumonia is only one type of lung inflammation."
234,How is narcolepsy diagnosed?,"However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram ( PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test ( MSLT). The PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition. The MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart."
234,What causes narcolepsy?,"Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain. In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep. These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy."
234,What are the symptoms of narcolepsy?,"People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger. Hallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening. Sleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak."
234,How is narcolepsy treated?,"The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder ( EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine-like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs. There has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called sodium oxybate ( Xyrem, helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Lifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms."
235,Can I be screened for breast cancer?,Studies have found that regular mammograms can help you live longer. But medical groups have different guidelines on when you should get them. Some recommend screening tests every other year starting at age 50 if you have a normal risk for breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends women starting at age 45 get yearly mammograms and those ages 40 â 44 should have the choice to begin yearly mammograms if they would like.
235,When is it difficult to treat breast cancer?,"Breast cancer caught early is easier to treat and cure than after it starts to spread. Some types of the disease are also more treatable than others. For example, a breast tumor that is ""estrogen receptor positive"" will benefit from drugs that lower estrogen levels. On the other hand, ""triple negative"" breast cancers tend to be more aggressive and don't benefit from targeted treatments."
235,What makes the chances of recovery from prostate cancer good?,"When that happens, they aren't harmful enough to need treatment. Many men with these types of tumors can live for years without problems. They often die of something other than their cancer."
235,When is testicular cancer difficult to treat?,"The 5-year survival rate for this type of tumor is 73%, still pretty high for a cancer in the late stages. Does screening help? There are no screening tests for testicular cancer."
235,How can I be tested for thyroid cancer?,There are no recommended screening tests for thyroid cancer. Most people find out they have a tumor when they (or a doctor) feel lumps or swelling in their neck. Sometimes a doctor spots the problem when you get an ultrasound for another reason. Definitely tell your doctor if you feel a lump in your neck or if you have any symptoms such as trouble breathing or swallowing.
235,Does screening for testicular cancer help the chances of recovery?,"There are no screening tests for testicular cancer. Men should see their doctor if they feel a lump in a testicle, or if one becomes larger than the other. These could be early signs of a tumor."
235,Does screening for melanoma help the chances of recovery?,"You can check your skin for large, dark, oddly shaped, or raised blotches. It's especially important to check your back and your scalp, scrotum, and in between your toes. It's harder to see melanomas in these places. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any of these changes. He can tell you if the spot is normal or not. Get screened regularly by a dermatologist if you have a higher risk for melanoma, like if you've had it before or it runs in your family."
235,How many people are alive five years after they have been diagnosed with prostate cancer?,People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: early stages of 0 and 1 - 99% to 100% What makes the chances of recovery good?
235,What makes the chances of recovery from melanoma good?,"You can usually spot melanoma skin cancer with the naked eye while it is still in its early stages. If it hasn't spread beyond the surface of the skin, doctors can remove and cure it with surgery."
235,How many people are alive five years after they have been diagnosed with melanoma?,People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: 91.7% What makes the chances of recovery good?
235,Can I be screened for testicular cancer?,"There are no screening tests for testicular cancer. Men should see their doctor if they feel a lump in a testicle, or if one becomes larger than the other. These could be early signs of a tumor."
235,When is thyroid cancer difficult to treat?,"A type of the disease called anaplastic thyroid cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 7%, but it's very rare."
235,What makes a cure less likely for thyroid cancer?,"A type of the disease called anaplastic thyroid cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 7%, but it's very rare."
235,What makes the chances of recovery from breast cancer good?,"Modern medicine has made great strides against breast cancer. Doctors today know more about how to find and treat it. We also understand the condition much better than ever before. For instance, we now know that breast cancer is not one disease but many. Researchers have come up with different medications to treat specific types."
235,How many people are alive five years after they have been diagnosed with breast cancer?,People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: early stages of 0 and 1 - 99% to 100% What makes the chances of recovery good?
235,How many people are alive five years after they have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer?,People alive 5 years after diagnosis: about 98% (depending on tissue type) What makes the chances of recovery good?
235,How many people are alive five years after they have been diagnosed with testicular cancer?,People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: 95.1% What makes the chances of recovery good?
235,When is prostate cancer difficult to treat?,"When cancer spreads (called metastatic cancer), it's much harder to treat. A small percentage of prostate cancers can move quickly to distant parts of the body. When that happens, only about 29% of men live 5 years after they're diagnosed. The good news is that doctors usually catch most prostate cancers early before they spread."
235,Is it possible to survive breast cancer?,"If you don't catch it early, melanoma is much more likely than other skin cancers to spread to other body parts. Modern medicine has made great strides against breast cancer. Doctors today know more about how to find and treat it. We also understand the condition much better than ever before. For instance, we now know that breast cancer is not one disease but many."
235,Does screening for breast cancer help the chances of recovery?,"That benchmark doesn't mean you can't die from cancer or even that you don't still have it in your body, but it is a good sign. PSA can go up for reasons other than prostate cancer, so some medical groups say men who have a normal risk for the disease shouldn't get the test. Some recommend screening tests every other year starting at age 50 if you have a normal risk for breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends women starting at age 45 get yearly mammograms and those ages 40 â 44 should have the choice to begin yearly mammograms if they would like."
235,What makes the chances of recovery from testicular cancer good?,"If a man has only one testicle removed (which is the norm), the other will usually make enough hormones for him to have sex and father children. For later-stage cancers, surgery and radiation or chemotherapy often work well. There are treatments that work well even for advanced testicular cancer. If it hasn't spread beyond the surface of the skin, doctors can remove and cure it with surgery."
235,What makes the chances of recovery from thyroid cancer good?,"The most common type of thyroid cancer, papillary, grows slowly. Even when tumors are large or start to grow into other nearby tissues, doctors often can treat and even cure this disease with surgery that removes the gland. After surgery, people take medicine to replace the hormones the thyroid makes. Doctors also are finding thyroid cancers earlier than ever before, which makes them easier to get rid of. It's especially important to check your back and your scalp, scrotum, and in between your toes."
235,How can I test for prostate cancer?,"One is the digital rectal exam, when your doctor checks inside your bottom with a gloved finger. The second is a blood test called the PSA test, which measures levels of a protein that's often higher in men with prostate cancer. PSA can go up for reasons other than prostate cancer, so some medical groups say men who have a normal risk for the disease shouldn't get the test. Talk with your doctor about whether you need testing. There are no screening tests for testicular cancer."
235,Is it possible to survive prostate cancer?,"When that happens, they aren't harmful enough to need treatment. Many men with these types of tumors can live for years without problems. They often die of something other than their cancer. People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: 91.7% What makes the chances of recovery good? Only 15%-20% of people who find melanomas after they've spread to other body parts will still be alive 5 years after their diagnosis."
236,How do I find out the cause of my wheezing?,"For example, if you have no history of lung disease and you always wheeze after eating a certain food or at a certain time of year, the doctor may suspect that you have a food or respiratory allergy. The doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear where the wheezing is and how much wheezing you have. If this is the first time you've been evaluated, your doctor will probably ask you to perform a breathing test (spirometry) and may also order a chest X-ray. Other blood tests and procedures may be necessary, depending on what the doctor learns from interviewing and examining you. If it seems like allergies may be related to your wheezing, there are a variety of other tests your doctor may use to verify allergies, including skin testing or blood tests. First off, see a doctor to determine the cause of your wheezing and then receive treatment for the specific cause."
236,When should you call 911 about wheezing?,"In emergencies, a medical team may administer any of the following: A shot of epinephrine to open clogged respiratory passages Oxygen A corticosteroid (such as methylprednisolone or prednisone) Frequent or continuous nebulizer (breathing) treatments A mechanical ventilator to help you breathe"
236,What are the treatments for wheezing if it is caused by asthma?,"First off, see a doctor to determine the cause of your wheezing and then receive treatment for the specific cause. If wheezing is caused by asthma, your doctor may recommend some or all of the following to reduce inflammation and open the airways: A fast-acting bronchodilator inhaler -- albuterol ( Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol ( Xopenex) -- to dilate constricted airways when you have respiratory symptoms An inhaled corticosteroid -- beclomethasone ( Qvar), budesonide ( Pulmicort), ciclesonide ( Alvesco), flunisolide ( Aerospan), fluticasone ( Flovent), mometasone ( Asmanex) A long-acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination -- budesonide/formoterol ( Symbicort), fluticasone/salmeterol ( Advair) A long-acting anticholinergic -- tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva Respimat). This drug is used in addition to a regular maintenance medication for better symptom control, and is available for use by anyone age 6 years and older. An asthma controller pill to reduce airway inflammation -- montelukast ( Singulair), zafirlukast ( Accolate) A non-sedating antihistamine pill -- cetirizine ( Zyrtec), fexofenadine ( Allegra), loratadine ( Claritin, Alavert) -- or a prescription nasal spray -- budesonide ( Rhinocort), fluticasone propionate ( Flonase), mometasone furoate ( Nasonex), triamcinolone acetonide ( Nasacort AQ) -- if you have nasal allergies. Flonase, Nasacort Allergy 24 HR and Rhinocort Allergy are also available over the counter."
236,What are the treatments for wheezing if it is caused by acute bronchitis?,"If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend some or all of the following: A bronchodilator -- albuterol ( Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol, ( Xopenex) -- to help ease the wheezing as the infection clears. An antibiotic is usually not needed unless you have an underlying chronic lung problem or your doctor suspects a bacterial infection may be present. Generally, any mild wheezing that accompanies acute bronchitis disappears when the infection does."
237,What can affect your blood pressure?,Blood pressure may go up or down depending on your: Age Heart condition Emotions Activity Medications One high reading doesn't mean you have high blood pressure. You have to measure your blood pressure at different times while resting to find out your typical value.
237,What is a normal blood pressure?,"The 100-120 is the systolic pressure; the diastolic pressure is 80. Blood pressure readings are written like fractions. For example, 120/80."
237,How do you measure your pulse?,"To measure your pulse, all you need is a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers. Count the number of taps you feel in 10 seconds, then multiply that number by six to find out your heart rate for 1 minute (pulse in 10 seconds x 6 = number of beats per minute)."
238,How does age affect your production of hormones and blood sugar?,"Your body also starts making less of some hormones, including the human growth hormone. Women will create less estrogen and progesterone, and men often produce less of the sex hormone testosterone. And as you get older, you may be more prone to illness and infections that can spike your blood sugar."
238,Is there anything I can take if menopause is affecting my blood sugar too much?,Testosterone therapy can improve your blood sugar levels.
238,How does diabetes affect the timing of menopause?,"You may reach menopause early if you have type 1 diabetes, but if you're overweight and have type 2, your changes could start later. That's because estrogen doesn't drop as quickly in heavier women."
238,How do I know if my symptoms are due to menopause or blood sugar if I have diabetes?,"The only way to know for sure -- and the safest thing to do -- is to test it. But checking too often can take an emotional toll. If you're worried, your doctor or diabetes educator can help you figure out how often to do it."
238,Can menopause affect type 1 diabetes?,"This can be a sign that your hormones are going down and you may need less insulin. It's important to know the difference between low blood sugar and moodiness or other perimenopause symptoms. You may reach menopause early if you have type 1 diabetes, but if you're overweight and have type 2, your changes could start later."
238,Are menopause symptoms similar to high or low blood sugar symptoms?,"As your body's changing, it's easy to confuse signs of menopause with symptoms of high or low blood sugar. Dizziness, sweating, irritability, and trouble concentrating could all result from hormonal changes or from blood sugar that's too high or too low."
238,Does menopause affect blood sugar in people with diabetes?,"As women get older, hormone changes before and during menopause often cause hot flashes, irritability, and trouble sleeping. Not only do these drops or spikes in the hormones impact your mood and life, but they can also affect your blood sugar. These ups and downs mean may mean you have to test your levels and make adjustments more often."
238,How do age-related hormones affect blood sugar in men with diabetes?,"Women will create less estrogen and progesterone, and men often produce less of the sex hormone testosterone. This can be a sign that your hormones are going down and you may need less insulin. Testosterone therapy can improve your blood sugar levels."
238,Why are women with diabetes more likely to have urinary tract and vaginal infections?,"You may reach menopause early if you have type 1 diabetes, but if you're overweight and have type 2, your changes could start later. Estrogen levels go down during menopause, causing vaginal dryness and other things."
238,How does age affect your blood sugar if you have diabetes?,"And as you age, your body doesn't use the insulin it makes as well as it did when you were younger. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may notice low blood sugar levels more often as you get closer to menopause."
239,How is rheumatoid arthritis treated?,"Treatments include medications, rest, exercise, and, in some cases, surgery to correct joint damage. Your options will depend on several things, including your age, overall health, medical history, and how severe your case is."
239,What strong medications are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"They work by interfering with or suppressing your immune system's attack on your joints. Traditional DMARDs are often the first-line treatment for RA: Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil), which was created to treat malaria Methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall), which was first developed to treat cancer Leflunomide ( Arava) Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Biologic response modifiers are man made versions of proteins in human genes."
239,Why are rest and exercise important for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Biologics approved for RA include: Abatacept ( Orencia), Adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita) Anakinra ( Kineret) Baricitinib ( Olumiant) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria) Infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra) Rituximab ( Rituxan) Sarilumab ( Kevzara) Tocilizumab ( Actemra) Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz) Upadacitinib ( Rinvoq) You need to be active, but you also have to pace yourself. During flare-ups, when inflammation gets worse, it's best to rest your joints. Using a cane or joint splints can help. When the inflammation eases, it's a good idea to exercise. It'll keep your joints flexible and strengthen the muscles that surround them. Low-impact activities, like brisk walking or swimming, and gentle stretching can help. You may want to work with a physical therapist at first."
239,What are the warnings signs of rheumatoid arthritis?,"The warning signs of RA are: Joint pain and swelling Stiffness, especially in the morning or after you sit for a long time Fatigue Rheumatoid arthritis affects everyone differently."
239,What is the cyclic citrulline antibody test for rheumatoid arthritis?,"Cyclic citrulline antibody test (anti- CCP): This more specific test checks for anti- CCP antibodies, which suggest you might have a more aggressive form of rheumatoid arthritis."
239,Why are rest and exercise important for rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics approved for RA include: Abatacept ( Orencia), Adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita) Anakinra ( Kineret) Baricitinib ( Olumiant) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria) Infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra) Rituximab ( Rituxan) Sarilumab ( Kevzara) Tocilizumab ( Actemra) Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz) Upadacitinib ( Rinvoq) You need to be active, but you also have to pace yourself.

You may want to work with a physical therapist at first."
239,Do people with rheumatoid arthritis have mild anemia?,She'll be looking for: Anemia: People with rheumatoid arthritis may have a low number of red blood cells. C-reactive protein ( CRP): High levels are also signs of inflammation.
239,How do doctors diagnose rheumatoid arthritis?,"There is no single test that shows whether you have RA. Your doctor will give you a checkup, ask you about your symptoms, and possibly perform X-rays and blood tests.

It's important to work with a doctor to find the best solution for your child."
250,What are signs of ADHD in children?,"These children: Are in constant motion Squirm and fidget Do not seem to listen Have trouble playing quietly Often talk excessively Interrupt or intrude on others Are easily distracted Do not finish tasks Though your child may have some symptoms that seem like ADHD, it might be something else. Studies show that long-term treatment with a combination of medications andbehavioral therapyis much better than just medication treatment, or no specific treatments in managing hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and symptoms of anxiety and depression."
250,What are some common traits of children with ADHD?,"These children: Are in constant motion Squirm and fidget Do not seem to listen Have trouble playing quietly Often talk excessively Interrupt or intrude on others Are easily distracted Do not finish tasks Though your child may have some symptoms that seem like ADHD, it might be something else. Studies show that long-term treatment with a combination of medications andbehavioral therapyis much better than just medication treatment, or no specific treatments in managing hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and symptoms of anxiety and depression."
250,Should my child have an ADHD coach?,"That's because many preschool children have some of the symptoms seen in ADHD in various situations. ADHD coaches are meant to help children achieve better results in different areas of their lives by setting goals and helping the child find ways to reach them. A child, however, must be mature and motivated enough to work with a coach."
251,What happens during stage III breast cancer?,"In stage III, the cancer has spread beyond the breast and into nearby lymph nodes. Usually many lymph nodes have cancer cells, or the tumor is so large it grows into the chest wall or skin of the breast. A combination of different treatments often works best."
251,How does surgery treat stage III breast cancer?,"Or you might need a mastectomy, in which the whole breast is removed. The surgeon would also remove lymph nodes. After a mastectomy, you might choose to get breast reconstruction surgery."
251,What are some different ways to receive chemotherapy to treat stage III breast cancer?,"You can get chemo several different ways. You may take pills or liquids, but often the drugs are put right into your veins. Depending on the type of treatment, it may be given in cycles that allow your body breaks in between."
251,How does hormone therapy treat stage III breast cancer?,"Hormone therapy can help women with hormone receptor-positive cancers. That means the cancer needs hormones to grow. In these women, medications can prevent the tumor from getting the hormone. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women and aromatase inhibitors anastrozole ( Arimidex), exemestane ( Aromasin), and letrozole ( Femara) for postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) and toremifene ( Fareston) block hormone receptors and are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. Women who haven't reached menopause may consider having their ovaries removed to stop them from making hormones that help cancer grow. Medications can also stop the ovaries from releasing hormones."
251,How does chemotherapy treat stage III breast cancer?,"Chemotherapy is a common treatment for stage III breast cancer. Sometimes people have chemo before surgery to shrink a tumor and make it easier to remove. It can help destroy cancer cells that remain after surgery. In cases where surgery isn't an option, chemotherapy may be the main treatment."
251,How does targeted therapy treat stage III breast cancer?,"Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) and toremifene ( Fareston) block hormone receptors and are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. Targeted therapy is a newer treatment. About 20% of women with breast cancer have too much of a protein known as HER2, and it makes the cancer spread quickly. Women with HER2-positive cancer may be prescribed ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla), lapatinib ( Tykerb), neratinib ( Nerlynx), pertuzumab ( Perjeta), or trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Along with an aromatase inhibitor or the hormone therapy fulvestrant, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor such as abemaciclib ( Verzenio), palbociclib ( Ibrance) or ribociclb ( Kisqali) is sometimes given in postmenopausal women with certain types of advanced breast cancer. These medications can stop this protein from making the cancer grow and can make chemotherapy more effective. Those who are HER2-negative but have BRCA-mutated breast cancer could be treated by a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that target a protein that helps cancer cells grow. PARP inhibitors include olaparib ( Lynparza) and talazoparib ( Talzenna). Everolimus ( Afinitor) is a targeted therapy sometimes given to women with HER2-negative breast cancer along with the hormone therapy exemestane ( Aromasin). Patients who are HER2-negative but have PIK3 CA-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer could be treated by the new PIK3 inhibitor alpelisib ( Piqray) in combination with fulvestrant."
252,Iâm looking for an oral surgeon. How can I be sure my doctor fits my needs?,"Find a specialist who has experience in the surgery you need. Dental implant surgery is different than jaw alignment, also called orthognathic surgery. Many websites can help you get specific. If the doctor's specialties aren't listed -- many will simply say âoral surgeryâ or something generic like that -- do another search. Look for the doctor specifically. See if you can track down a site for the hospital where the doctor works or the doctor's office. These places may list specialties and have a short biography on the doctor."
252,I need oral surgery. What are things to consider about insurance?,"You can find doctors that are in your insurer's network by calling them or visiting their web site. Most companies will list doctors by specialty and show you where their offices are. Make a list, cross-check it with any recommendations you get, and go from there. You can choose out-of-network doctors, too. But that usually costs more."
252,What should I know about where my oral surgery will happen?,"It's important to look into where your surgery will take place. Make sure the hospital, clinic, or doctor's office is accredited, highly rated, and has experience dealing with surgeries of your type. If you can't find the information online, ask the office for it. Make sure you look for information about the staff and how it cares for patients."
252,Iâve found an oral surgeon I like. How can I get a feel for the new doctor?,"After he gives you a name, ask him these questions. Why do you recommend this surgeon? What are his specialties? If you can't find the information online, ask the office for it."
252,What are some tips on finding an oral surgeon on the Internet?,"So if you don't have a regular dentist who can recommend an oral surgeon, and friends or family can't help you out, take advantage of the web. Lots of sites rate surgeons and their offices. To one person, someone who's all-business has no bedside manner. To another, that same professional is great because he's all-business. Web sites can also give you background on the doctor, too. Make sure you look for information about the staff and how it cares for patients."
253,When should you call a doctor about dehydration in children under 12 years?,"Has extremely dry mouth or no tears Is lethargic Is older and does not urinate in 12 or more hours Isn't alert or able to think clearly Passes out Is too weak or dizzy to stand In young children, mild to moderate dehydration can happen very easily, particularly if the child has diarrhea or is vomiting. Contact your child's pediatrician if your child: Is not drinking enough or eating enough Looks tired Has dark yellow urine or decreased urination Has dry mouth and eyes Is cranky or irritable Vomits more than once Is under 1 year old For dehydration in an infant up to 1 year old: If you breast-feed, nurse more often."
253,How can you replace fluids for mild dehydration in a child age 1 to 11?,"For mild dehydration in a child age 1 to 11: Give extra fluids in frequent, small sips, especially if the child is vomiting. Choose clear soup, clear soda, or Pedialyte, if possible. Give popsicles, ice chips, and cereal mixed with milk for added water or fluid. Continue a regular diet."
253,When should you call 911 about dehydration in children under 12 years?,"Has extremely dry mouth or no tears Is lethargic Is older and does not urinate in 12 or more hours Isn't alert or able to think clearly Passes out Is too weak or dizzy to stand In young children, mild to moderate dehydration can happen very easily, particularly if the child has diarrhea or is vomiting."
253,How can you replace fluids for dehydration in an infant up to 1 year old?,"Contact your child's pediatrician if your child: Is not drinking enough or eating enough Looks tired Has dark yellow urine or decreased urination Has dry mouth and eyes Is cranky or irritable Vomits more than once Is under 1 year old For dehydration in an infant up to 1 year old: If you breast-feed, nurse more often. If you bottle feed, give your baby the usual amount of fluid, unless the baby is vomiting. If your baby is vomiting, give smaller amounts more frequently. For example, instead of 6 ounces every 4 hours, give 3 ounces every 2 hours. If she vomits more than once, call your doctor. If your baby eats solid food, cereal, strained bananas, and mashed potatoes, also provide fluids. Give an oral rehydration solution such as Pedialyte, if possible. It replaces salt, sugar, potassium, and other nutrients. Ask your doctor what type and quantity to use."
254,What are the different types of ear drops?,"For the most part, there are three main types of eye drops: Artificial tears Allergy drops Anti-redness drops Some eye drops might do a combination of things, but if you understand these basic types, you'll know how to choose wisely. You might also notice some natural, homeopathic, or herbal eye drops. Generally, there's just not a lot of evidence about how well these really work."
254,Why should you watch out for preservatives in artificial tears relative to eye drops?,"Artificial tears with them can be great because they're often cheaper. But for some people, they can make dry eyes worse. Some people are allergic to preservatives, and others may find that they irritate their eyes."
254,What's in allergy eye drops?,"The key ingredient in allergy eye drops is a drug called an antihistamine, which blocks histamines from doing their work and prevents allergy symptoms. Some newer allergy eye drops, called mast-cell stabilizers, work by stopping your body from making histamines in the first place."
254,How can I find preservative-free eye drops?,"When you're looking for preservative-free eye drops, note that they don't come in the typical eye drop bottle. You usually find them in single-use vials instead. You snap the lid off, put the drops in, and throw out the vial. They also tend to be more expensive than other kinds."
254,When should I use anti-redness drops for my eyes?,"But use with caution. If you put them in for more than a few days, they can irritate your eyes and make the redness even worse. Another problem: If you use them often, your eyes get dependent on them and may get red when you stop using them. Avoid these drops if you have dry eyes. Sometimes, anti-redness drops also have antihistamines in them, which can relieve itchiness from allergies. But again, you're limited in how much you can use them without bothering your eyes. You're typically better off with allergy drops."
254,When should I see a doctor about my eye drops?,"That makes the redness go away. Also, see her if taking drops makes your eye problem worse or affects your vision."
254,What are artificial tears?,"They try to mimic real tears, but it turns out, that's pretty complicated. So various brands use different mixes of ingredients, such as: Lubricants to keep your eyes moist (all artificial tears will have some) Electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, which can help heal the surface of your eye Guar gum, found in more oily drops. Preservatives to keep bacteria from growing in the bottle of drops You may need to try different brands to see which one works best for your eyes. Avoid artificial tears that contain preservatives if: They bother your eyes."
255,How do decongestants work?,"They help reduce swelling in the passageways of your nose, which relieves the feeling of pressure and improves the flow of air. You'll be able to breathe a whole lot better. Decongestants come in pill form or nasal sprays. Don't use the sprays for more than 3 days, or you may get more stuffed up."
255,What medicines are used for congestion?,"Decongestants and antihistamines can help. They come in different forms, and they're often mixed into combination drugs that you can buy without a prescription. It pays to do a little homework to make sure you're picking the right medicine for your symptoms."
255,What are the side effects of decongestants?,"Decongestants may keep you awake and are usually taken during the day. Nasal sprays are less likely to have that side effect and may be helpful at night for congestion. Decongestants can also raise blood pressure. So if your BP is high already, or you've got heart disease, check with your doctor before you use them."
255,Which antihistamines help for cold symptoms?,"Some types of them can help relieve your runny nose and sneezing when you have a cold. Even so, some of the older antihistamines, such as brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine, can bring relief. Newer antihistamines like fexofenadine ( Allegra) and loratidine ( Claritin) have not been shown to work for cold symptoms."
256,What does radiation therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involve?,"Radiation therapy, the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; this is not used often for ALL, but may be used to treat leukemia in the brain or bone, for example, or before a stem cell transplant."

256,What is the outlook for people with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?,The outlook for acute lymphoblastic leukemia depends on factors such as: Your age: Younger patients tend to have a better outlook. Your lab test results: The prognosis is better if you have a lower white blood count when you're diagnosed. Your subtype of ALL ( B-cell ALL or T-cell ALL) Whether you have a chromosome abnormality called the Philadelphia chromosome; having it suggests a poorer prognosis. Your response to chemotherapy: The prognosis is better if you have no evidence of leukemia four to five weeks after starting treatment.
256,What does a bone marrow transplant involve for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?,"A bone marrow transplant, which involves use of high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation followed by a transplant of bone-forming stem cells. Stem cells usually come from a donor, or less likely, from your own bone marrow or peripheral blood. If you cannot tolerate high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, lower doses may be used with a ""mini-transplant."""
256,What chemotherapy drugs are used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?,"These include: Chemotherapy, the use of anticancer drugs in combination, generally over a couple of years. Agents used for ALL include: cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan)cytarabine ( Cytosar)daunorubicin ( Cerubidine) or doxorubicin ( Adriamycin)etoposide ( VP-16) L-asparaginace ( Elspar) or PEG- L-asapraginase ( Oncaspar)6-mercaptopurine (6- MP, Purinethol)methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall)methoterate oral ( Xatmep)steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone)teniposide ( Vumonvincristine ( Oncovin) Targeted therapy, drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells and tend to have fewer or less severe side effects than chemotherapy; examples include blinatumomab ( Blincyto), dasatinib ( Sprycel), imatinib ( Gleevec), and nilotinib ( Tasigna), ponatinib ( Iclusig), which attack cells with the Philadelphia chromosome."
256,What are the goals of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?,"Treatment occurs in two parts -- induction therapy and post-induction therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve remission by: Killing as many leukemia cells as possible Returning blood counts to normal Ridding the body of signs of disease for a long time About eight or nine out of 10 adults achieve remission after treatments, but many relapse, which lowers the overall cure rate to 30% to 40%."
256,What does targeted therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involve?,"Agents used for ALL include: cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan)cytarabine ( Cytosar)daunorubicin ( Cerubidine) or doxorubicin ( Adriamycin)etoposide ( VP-16) L-asparaginace ( Elspar) or PEG- L-asapraginase ( Oncaspar)6-mercaptopurine (6- MP, Purinethol)methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall)methoterate oral ( Xatmep)steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone)teniposide ( Vumonvincristine ( Oncovin) Targeted therapy, drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells and tend to have fewer or less severe side effects than chemotherapy; examples include blinatumomab ( Blincyto), dasatinib ( Sprycel), imatinib ( Gleevec), and nilotinib ( Tasigna), ponatinib ( Iclusig), which attack cells with the Philadelphia chromosome."
256,What are the symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?,"For most people, the cause of ALL is unknown. Some of these can be vague and not specific just to leukemia. They include: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite or weight Night sweats Many symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are the result of a shortage of normal blood cells. That's because leukemia cells crowd out these normal cells in the bone marrow. A shortage of red blood cells may cause symptoms of anemia, including: Fatigue or weakness Dizziness Feeling cold Light-headedness Shortness of breath A shortage of normal white blood cells may result in: Fevers Recurring infections A shortage of blood platelets may cause symptoms such as: Lots of bruising for no obvious reason Frequent or severe nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or other unusual bleeding such as from minor cuts Depending upon where leukemia cells are present, other symptoms may include: A full or swollen belly from leukemia cells in the liver or spleen Enlarged lymph nodes such as in the neck or groin, under arms, or above the collarbone Bone or joint pain Headache, trouble with balance, vomiting, seizures, or blurred vision if the cancer has spread to the brain Trouble breathing if spread has occurred in the chest area ALL is really a group of related diseases, or subtypes."
256,What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?,"It develops from cells called lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell central to the immune system, or from lymphoblasts, an immature type of lymphocyte. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia invades the blood and can spread throughout the body to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. But it does not normally produce tumors as do many types of cancer. It is an acute type of leukemia, which means it can progress quickly. Without treatment, it can be fatal within a few months. That's because leukemia cells crowd out these normal cells in the bone marrow."
256,What does the treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involve?,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL) is a type of blood cancer. Therefore, your treatment options depend upon your subtype and other factors. You may have more than one type of treatment."

260,What causes primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)?,"The main symptoms often involve: Problems walking Weak, stiff legs Trouble with balance Other common symptoms include: Speech or swallowing issues Vision problems Fatigue and pain Bladder and bowel trouble Doctors think MS -- no matter which type you have -- happens when your body attacks itself. In MS, your immune system damages myelin, the protective coating around the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. This causes inflammation. But in PPMS, there's little inflammation. Nerve damage is the main problem. Areas of scar tissue (your doctor will call them lesions), form along the damaged nerves in your brain and spinal cord. This causes MS symptoms. The biggest risk isn't from MS, but from complications like heart disease and stroke."
260,How is primary progressive multiple sclerosis related to multiple sclerosis?,"But in PPMS, there's little inflammation. Nerve damage is the main problem.

261,How are heart failure and sleep related?,"Having heart failure means you're likely to have other health issues, including sleep problems. Likewise, sleep problems, including obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) and insomnia, can make your heart failure symptoms worse. A good night's sleep is important, whether your heart is healthy or not. Rest helps your heart as well as your energy levels, thinking skills, and overall health. If you can deal with your sleep problems, you may ease the burden on your heart."
261,How can a sleep specialist help with medical sleep problems?,"A sleep specialist can help you figure out what's going on medically, whether you're dealing with insomnia or OSA or something else, and how to treat it."
261,What is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?,"OSA is more common among people who are overweight, but anyone can get it. The tissue in the back of your throat relaxes and blocks your airway while you sleep. You stop breathing, so your brain signals your throat muscles to contract, which opens up your airway again. This can happen dozens or even hundreds of times a night."
261,How can heart failure make it hard to breathe while sleeping?,"During the day, you're standing and sitting, so extra fluid would normally settle in your legs and feet. But lie down, and it's going to move up into your chest and throat. This can close in your lungs and airway, making it harder to breathe. Your doctor might prescribe diuretics to help get rid of that extra fluid. But these medicines don't stop working when you sleep, which can mean interrupting your slumber for a trip or two to the bathroom."
261,What can you do to set yourself up for a restful night's sleep?,"Set yourself up for restful sleep: Stick to a regular sleep/wake schedule. Turn off the TV, computer, and other devices before bedtime. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Avoid alcohol before bedtime and caffeine in the afternoon or evening. Exercise every morning."

262,What happens with osteoarthritis?,"What happens: You lose your body's shock absorber. Cartilage, the slippery material that covers the ends of bones, gradually breaks down. One example is what can happen to your knees when you're overweight. The extra pounds put more pressure on the cartilage as it gets squeezed between the bones. It gets damaged and wears away, so there isn't as much left to cushion the joint. The damaged cartilage makes movement painful. You may hear a grating sound when the roughened cartilage on the surface of the bones rubs together. You may get painful spurs or bumps on the end of the bones, especially on fingers and feet. The joint lining can get inflamed, but it's not common with osteoarthritis."
262,What are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?,"Symptoms: Psoriatic arthritis can swell the fingers and toes. People who have it often have fingernails that are pitted or discolored, too.

262,What happens in psoriatic arthritis?,"What happens: This type of arthritis usually starts between ages 30 and 50, but it can start as early as childhood. It's equally common among men and women. The skin disease (psoriasis) usually shows up first."
262,What is psoriatic arthritis?,"People with this condition have inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). Psoriasis causes patchy, raised, red and white areas of inflamed skin with scales. It usually affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the scalp, the navel, and skin around the genital areas or anus. Only about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis will also get psoriatic arthritis."
262,What is osteoarthritis?,"More people have this condition than any other form of arthritis. It's the ""wear and tear"" that happens when your joints are overused. It usually happens with age, but it can also come from joint injuries or obesity, which puts extra stress on your joints. Joints that bear weight -- like your knees, hips, feet, and spine -- are the most common places it affects. It often comes on gradually over months or years. It makes the affected joint hurt. But you don't feel sick or have the fatigue that comes with some other types of arthritis."
262,What happens if you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"What happens: Doctors don't know exactly what causes RA. Some experts believe the immune system becomes ""confused"" after an infection with a bacteria or virus and starts to attack your joints. This battle can spread to other areas of the body. Scientists think two of the body's chemicals that are related to inflammation, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) and interleukin-1, trigger other parts of the immune system in rheumatoid arthritis. Medicines that block TNF, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 can improve the symptoms and prevent joint damage."
262,Are there numerous types of arthritis?,Did you know that there are more than 100 types of arthritis? Symptoms: Psoriatic arthritis can swell the fingers and toes.
263,Can you exercise if you have hemophilia?,Your doctor will discuss the types of physical activities that are appropriate and what kinds of activities may be too dangerous. Your doctor's advice depends on the type and severity of hemophilia.
263,How can adynovate help with treating hemophilia?,"Adynovate is used to replace clotting factor VIII to help prevent and control bleeding in adults and children with hemophilia A. Idelvion, Coagulation Factor IX ( Recombinant), albumin fusion protein is used to help control and prevent bleeding in children and adults with hemophilia B."
263,Are hemophilia treatments the same for everyone?,"Treatments for hemophilia include: Receiving clotting factors replacement therapy Medication Treatment for joint bleeding and other problems associated with hemophilia The treatments you need will depend on the type of hemophilia and the severity of hemophilia.

264,How are antihistamines and decongestants used to treat postnasal drip?,"They can also be effective, along with steroid nasal sprays, for postnasal drip caused by allergies. The older, over-the-counter antihistamines, including diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine ( Chlor- Trimeton), might not be the best choices for postnasal drip. When they dry out mucus, they can actually thicken it. Newer antihistamines like loratadine ( Claritin, Alavert), fexofenadine ( Allegra), cetirizine ( Zyrtec), levocetirizine ( Xyzal), and desloratadine ( Clarinex), may be better options and are less likely to cause drowsiness. It's a good idea to check with your doctor before taking these because all of them can have side effects that range from dizziness to dry mouth."
264,What causes postnasal drip?,"The excess mucus that triggers it has many possible causes, including: Colds Flu Allergies , also called allergic postnasal drip Sinus infection or sinusitis , which is an inflammation of the sinuses Object stuck in the nose (most common in children) Pregnancy Certain medications , including some for birth control and blood pressure Deviated septum , which is the crooked placement of the wall that separates the two nostrils, or some other problem with the structure of the nose that affects the sinuses Changing weather, cold temperatures, or really dry air Certain foods (for example, spicy foods may trigger mucus flow) Fumes from chemicals, perfumes, cleaning products, smoke, or other irritants Sometimes the problem is not that you're producing too much mucus, but that it's not being cleared away."
264,What else can cause postnasal drip?,"The excess mucus that triggers it has many possible causes, including: Colds Flu Allergies , also called allergic postnasal drip Sinus infection or sinusitis , which is an inflammation of the sinuses Object stuck in the nose (most common in children) Pregnancy Certain medications , including some for birth control and blood pressure Deviated septum , which is the crooked placement of the wall that separates the two nostrils, or some other problem with the structure of the nose that affects the sinuses Changing weather, cold temperatures, or really dry air Certain foods (for example, spicy foods may trigger mucus flow) Fumes from chemicals, perfumes, cleaning products, smoke, or other irritants Sometimes the problem is not that you're producing too much mucus, but that it's not being cleared away. Swallowing problems can cause a buildup of liquids in the throat, which can feel like postnasal drip. These problems can sometimes occur with age, a blockage, or conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD."
264,How can you reduce triggers of postnasal drip?,"You can also try propping up your pillows at night so that the mucus doesn't pool or collect in the back of your throat. If you have allergies, here are some other ways to reduce your triggers: Cover your mattresses and pillowcases with dust mite proof covers. Wash all sheets, pillowcases, and mattress covers often in hot water. Use special HEPA air filters in your home. These can remove very fine particles from the air. Dust and vacuum regularly."
264,When should you call the doctor about postnasal drip?,"Call your doctor if the drainage is bad smelling, you have a fever, you're wheezing, or your symptoms are severe or last for 10 days or more. You might have a bacterial infection. Let your doctor know right away if you notice blood in your postnasal drip. If medication doesn't relieve your symptoms, you might need to see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (also called an otolaryngologist) for evaluation. Your doctor might want you to get a CT scan, X-rays, or other tests."
264,What are other methods to treat postnasal drip?,"Other methods you can try include: Take a medication such as guaifenesin ( Mucinex). Use saline nasal sprays or irrigation, like a neti pot, to flush mucus, bacteria, allergens, and other irritating things out of the sinuses. Turn on a vaporizer or humidifier to increase the moisture in the air."
264,How do you treat postnasal drip?,"How you treat postnasal drip depends on what's causing it. Antibiotics can clear up a bacterial infection. However, green or yellow mucus is not proof of a bacterial infection. Colds can also turn the mucus these colors, and they are caused by viruses, which don't respond to antibiotics."
264,What is postnasal drip?,"Your nose alone makes about a quart of it each day. Mucus is a thick, wet substance that moistens these areas and helps trap and destroy foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses before they cause infection. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Normally, you don't notice the mucus from your nose because it mixes with saliva, drips harmlessly down the back of your throat, and you swallow it. When your body produces more mucus than usual or it's thicker than normal, it becomes more noticeable. The excess can come out of the nostrils -- that's a runny nose. When the mucus runs down the back of your nose to your throat, it's called postnasal drip."
264,How can you thin your mucus to treat postnasal drip?,Another option is to thin your mucus. A simple way to thin it out is to drink more water.
264,Can chicken soup cure postnasal drip?,"When the mucus runs down the back of your nose to your throat, it's called postnasal drip. It works because the steam from the hot liquid opens up your stuffy nose and throat. And because it's a fluid, the hot soup will help prevent dehydration, which will make you feel better too."
264,What are the symptoms of postnasal drip?,"Swallowing problems can cause a buildup of liquids in the throat, which can feel like postnasal drip. It also can trigger a cough, which often gets worse at night. In fact, postnasal drip is one of the most common causes of a cough that just won't go away. Too much mucus may also make you feel hoarse and give you a sore, scratchy throat. If the mucus plugs up your Eustachian tube, which connects your throat to your middle ear, you could get a painful ear infection. You could also get a sinus infection if those passages are clogged."
265,Can nasal sprays be used for children?,"A lot of over-the-counter decongestants, including these sprays, aren't recommended for children. Read the labels carefully and talk to your pediatrician."
265,What are decongestant nasal sprays?,"You can buy these over the counter or with a prescription from your doctor. They get rid of your stuffiness by narrowing blood vessels in the lining of your nose, which shrinks swollen tissues. Don't use them for more than 3 days, or your cold symptoms could get worse."
265,What are steroid nasal sprays?,"You can get these over the counter or with a prescription. They're approved to relieve allergy symptoms, but they're sometimes used to help clear a stuffed-up nose that comes from a sinus infection."

The first thing you need to do is to blow your nose to clear up the passageways as much as you can."
266,Should you drink water and go to the bathroom frequently if you have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"All adults and children with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should take frequent bathroom breaks. This helps to avoid over-distending the bladder, which can cause long-term problems, though rarely. The most important treatment for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is to ensure constant access to lots of water. Not keeping up with fluid losses can lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, which can sometimes be severe. Seek medical help if symptoms don't improve after rehydrating, eating fresh fruit, and taking a multivitamin."
266,How are my kidneys involved in my nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, enough ADH is produced. But the kidneys are partially or completely blind to it. Typically, the kidneys' ADH sensors are missing or defective. As a result, ADH flows by without effect. The kidneys don't absorb enough water. Instead, they excrete abundant dilute urine as if no ADH were present."
266,Can nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cause me to use the bathroom frequently?,"Symptoms of electrolyte imbalances include: Unexplained weakness Lethargy Muscle pains Irritability For someone without nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the extreme thirst it creates can be hard to understand. Some people need to drink a large glass of liquid every 15 minutes, all day, every day. And since the kidneys aren't holding that water in, that means a lot of bathroom breaks."
266,What causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems related to a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It's stored in the pituitary gland. Release of ADH is triggered by fluid loss or dehydration. When it's released, it causes the kidneys to retain water. This results in a decrease and concentration of urine."
266,What are mechanisms by which nephrogenic diabetes insipidus works?,"Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems related to a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It's stored in the pituitary gland. Release of ADH is triggered by fluid loss or dehydration.

Instead, they excrete abundant dilute urine as if no ADH were present."
266,What are symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,The lack of ability by the kidneys to conserve water leads to the symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. They include: Excessive thirst Excessive urine production (polyuria).
266,How do I know if my nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused an electrolyte imbalance?,"In some people, these symptoms can become extreme and cause dehydration. Excessive fluid losses can also cause electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms of electrolyte imbalances include: Unexplained weakness Lethargy Muscle pains Irritability For someone without nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the extreme thirst it creates can be hard to understand."
266,Can my nephrogenic diabetes insipidus be treated?,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be challenging to treat. Since the kidneys can't respond to ADH, giving more ADH doesn't help. There's no good way to get the kidneys to respond to the ADH that's there. In fact, treatment options are limited."
266,How is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus treated?,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be challenging to treat. Since the kidneys can't respond to ADH, giving more ADH doesn't help. There's no good way to get the kidneys to respond to the ADH that's there. In fact, treatment options are limited. If a drug like lithium is responsible, switching medicines might improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most adults with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are able to keep up with fluid losses by drinking water. For some people, though, the symptoms of near-constant thirst and urination can become intolerable. Some treatments can reduce the symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, at least somewhat: Diet. A low-salt, low-protein diet reduces urine output. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen ( Motrin), indomethacin ( Indocin), and naproxen ( Naprosyn) also can reduce urination. Diuretics. It might seem paradoxical, but ""water pills"" like hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride can ease excessive urination from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."
267,How can you make a child comfortable when they have a cough?,"Let the child rest. Avoid irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Don't give cough medicine to a child under age 4 unless your pediatrician suggests it."

Also explain what it means to have it. It's also possible that your partner might take the news badly no matter how well you deliver it.
269,When should I send medications to school for my child with asthma?,"Most kids can better manage their asthma symptoms if they carry and know how to use their asthma inhalers and other medications at school. At the same time, schools must follow state laws and policies about whether students can carry and use inhalers and other treatments, like epinephrine auto-injectors. If your child's school doesn't usually let kids carry medicine, talk with school officials to figure out what skills he would need to show in order to make that possible. Then work with his doctor to make learning those skills a part of your child's asthma action plan. The doctor can also tell the school whether she recommends letting your child carry and give himself his medicine."
269,How can I prevent asthma problems for my child at school?,"The most important thing is to talk to your child and explain to him as much about asthma as he can understand at his age. Ideally, he should be able to keep track of when it's time to take his medicine and know how to use an inhaler. You should also brief school officials on the details of your child's asthma. They should know how severe his condition is, his triggers, which medications he needs and how to give them, and what to do in case of an asthma attack."
269,Who should manage my child's asthma at school?,"The more teachers and other adults at school who know about your child's asthma, the better. He could have an asthma attack in art or music class, in the hallway, or another area where his classroom teacher isn't around. So make sure a few different adults know how to help: Classroom teacher."
269,How can the school nurse help my child with asthma?,"Also, it is very important to make sure the school nurse has all the medicines that your child might need during school hours, along with instructions for giving them. Remember that for some inhalers, there's often no way to tell if the device still has medicine in it or not. You will need to keep track of the date when you send the inhaler and replace the medicines at school regularly."
269,How does an asthma action plan help my child in school?,"You may want to schedule a conference with teachers and other school officials to go over the plan and any other details they should know, including correct inhaler use, location of the inhaler, and signs of trouble breathing Also, look around your child's classroom and other areas he might go at the school to see if there are any known allergy or asthma triggers. If you are aware of any, like dust mites or dust, you should work with the teacher to see if the school can reduce them. She can give you an idea of what the school policies are for medications and other types of care. The asthma action plan should clearly say what to do if your child is having asthma symptoms that his inhaler can't stop."
270,How can you manage sinus pressure from nasal allergy symptoms?,"Your sinuses are small spaces behind your forehead, cheeks, and eyes. If mucus builds up in these areas because of allergies, you may feel pressure or pain. You can try a few things to help clear up your stuffed-up sinuses. Put a moist, warm cloth on your face, or breathe in steam a few times each day. You can also try oral or nasal decongestants and over the counter pain medicines. Call your doctor if you feel sinus pain and pressure for more than a week."
270,How can you manage postnasal drip from nasal allergy symptoms?,"If mucus builds up in these areas because of allergies, you may feel pressure or pain.

270,How can you manage itchy eyes from nasal allergy symptoms?,"For example, stay inside when pollen counts are high if that's a source of your allergies. If you can't avoid the allergy trigger that makes you sneeze, or if that doesn't help, try an over-the-counter antihistamine. Try not to rub your eyes, since this can irritate them, and don't wear contact lenses. To soothe the itch, put a cold washcloth over your eyes or use artificial tears. Over-the-counter or prescription allergy meds or eye drops that contain an antihistamine can also help relieve symptoms."

271,How do blood loss and blood clots happen in periods?,"Though it can vary from month to month, periods usually start off with a light flow, get heavier, then taper off. On average, women lose about 2 to 4 tablespoons of blood during each period. In terms of pads or tampons, that means changing them out every 2 hours or more. If you need to change out less than every 2 hours -- or have quarter-size or larger clots -- let your doctor know. Small clots of blood are common. Your body releases anticoagulants to keep the blood from clotting as it moves through your vagina. But on days when you're bleeding or cramping heavily, it may not be released in time."

You can still do everything that you would during the rest of the month, if you know how to manage the baggage your monthly visitor may bring. It also depends on ovulation, or when your ovaries release an egg about halfway through your cycle."
271,How does cramping happen in periods?,"Cramps can start before your period and last throughout the bleeding process.

The average is 28 days, and anything between 21 and 35 is normal."
272,Should I tell my coworkers that I have eczema?,"If your co-workers aren't familiar with eczema, you may worry about what they think about your skin issues. Your co-workers may not know that eczema is a chronic skin condition that isn't contagious. They might not realize it can cause problems (like pain and bleeding, cracking skin) -- or even that it can show up on areas of your body like your hands. If you're embarrassed or ashamed about your skin or the problems your eczema causes, it can help to have a short conversation with your co-workers. You don't have to tell them everything, but you could say something like, â I have a condition called eczema that can make my skin irritated. You can't catch it.â Don't be afraid to ask others for help when you need it."

275,What is the Sugar Busters! Diet?,"You can lose weight with a high-fiber diet made up of the right kinds of fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains. But you have to give up refined sugar and flour and make other tweaks to the way you eat. The plan emphasizes foods with a low glycemic index ( GI), which help keep your blood sugar levels steady. Foods with a higher GI make your blood sugar rise more than those with a lower GI. The foods with the highest GI are carbohydrates, including white bread, white rice, white potatoes, white flour, and sugar. But don't jump to conclusions: Carbs aren't all bad. The book teaches you how to eat the ârightâ carbs, especially whole grains."
275,How compatible is the Sugar Busters! diet with low-salt diet?,"Low-salt diet: You can try Sugar Busters! if you're on a salt-restricted diet. Too much salt can be bad for your heart, and the authors warn that salt is often added to processed foods. They suggest that you don't need to add salt to your food when cooking. But you'll still need to check the sodium on food labels."
275,How compatible is the Sugar Busters! diet with low-fat diet?,"Low-fat diet: You can't follow a typical low-fat, high-carb diet if you're following Sugar Busters! because low-fat foods are often high in refined sugars. The diet requires you to get 30%-40% of calories from fat. But you should eat low-fat dairy products and lean cuts of meat."

278,How are colon polyps treated?,"During a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, your doctor uses forceps or a wire loop to remove polyps. This is called a polypectomy. If the polyp is too large to take out this way, you may need surgery to remove it. Once it's out, a pathologist tests it for cancer. If you have a genetic condition like familial adenomatous polyposis, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove part or all of your colon and rectum. That's the best way to prevent colon cancer for people with these health problems. If you have colon polyps, there's a good chance you'll get more of them later on. Your doctor will recommend that you have more screening tests in the future."
278,What causes colon polyps?,"Doctors don't know exactly why they form. Normally, healthy cells grow and divide in a specific way. Polyps may happen when cells grow and divide more than they should.

280,How does Tourette's syndrome differ from ADHD?,"Tics from Tourette's syndrome are different from the movements or noises that kids with ADHD might make. They almost always involve fast, repeated face or shoulder movements or sounds, which happen the same way each time. Often, kids with ADHD won't have any tic-like movements. Instead, they have trouble staying focused or paying attention. They might be easily distracted or have problems staying organized.

Most kids are diagnosed during elementary school. On average, Tourette's syndrome begins around 7 years old. And some children have both conditions. More than 60% of those with Tourette's syndrome also have ADHD. They also may have related conditions, like obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD), learning disorders, and depression. Researchers have found that there may be a genetic link between Tourette's syndrome and disorders like ADHD and OCD. They have a similar biology that makes them more likely to happen together."
280,What does the treatment for ADHD involve?,"Treatment for kids with ADHD often includes a mix of medication and behavior therapy. Stimulants are the drugs that are most commonly prescribed for the condition, but other drugs, like atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine, and antidepressants, can help, too. In behavior therapy for ADHD, kids learn or build on positive behaviors to replace others that cause problems."
280,How is Tourette syndrome or ADHD diagnosed?,"Your doctor will be able to tell whether your child's symptoms belong to ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, both, or something else. There's no special test to diagnose either condition. Your doctor will ask about symptoms and when they started. He might do a blood test and medical exam to see if anything else could be causing the problem."
280,How are ADHD and Tourette's syndrome treated in the same person?,"If your child has Tourette's syndrome, his doctor will likely suggest that he take medication to help with his tics. That may ease stress and improve attention, which can sometimes strengthen a kid's ability to control his tics."
280,What are the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome?,"They can also be complex, like shoulder shrugging, facial expressions, head movements, or repeating words or phrases. The tics usually happen several times each day. They almost always involve fast, repeated face or shoulder movements or sounds, which happen the same way each time. Also, Tourette's syndrome is rare."

You use it once a day for 20 minutes, and when it's on you'll feel a tingling or massaging sensation. Spring TM or e Neura s TMS may be another option. You hold this device at the back of your head at the first sign of a headache, and it gives off a magnetic pulse that stimulates part of the brain. In addition, there is a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator called gamma Core. When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."
281,Does migraine run in families?,"Migraines often run in families, so researchers think there may be a genetic link for the condition. Other things can trigger migraine attacks for some people, like some foods, smells, stress, and things in the environment."

To treat your toothache, your dentist will first obtain your medical history and conduct a physical exam. He or she will ask you questions about the pain, such as when the pain started, how severe it is, where the pain is located, what makes the pain worse, and what makes it better."
283,What can your dentist do for a toothache?,"He or she will ask you questions about the pain, such as when the pain started, how severe it is, where the pain is located, what makes the pain worse, and what makes it better.

284,What increases my chances of getting peptic ulcer?,"You can have ulcers at any age, but your chances go up as you get older."
284,How can bacteria cause peptic ulcers?,"It's called Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori), and as many as half of us carry it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts aren't sure how H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing. You may also get it from unclean food and water."
284,How is peptic ulcer diagnosed?,"Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. She'll also check you for bloating in the belly and pain. That may be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have an ulcer is to look. She may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy. This test allows her to pass a thin, bendy tube down your throat and into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a camera at the end so she can check the lining for ulcers. She may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori. Blood, breath, and stool sample tests also can screen for the bacteria."
284,How are peptic ulcers treated?,"But if you don't treat them, the ulcers tend to come back. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal."
284,Are there different types of peptic ulcer?,"You can have two types of peptic ulcer disease: Gastric ulcer. This appears at the top end of the small intestine, an organ that digests and absorbs much of the food you eat."
284,What is a peptic ulcer?,"But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. You'll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal."
284,What causes peptic ulcers?,"You have a peptic ulcer if you get open sores in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes."
284,What are the symptoms of peptic ulcers?,"You may have no symptoms, or you may feel discomfort or burning pain. You might especially notice it on an empty stomach -- such as between meals or at night. The pain may stop for a little while if you eat or take an antacid, but then return. The pain can last for a few minutes or a few hours, and may come and go for many days or weeks. Other symptoms may include: Bloated feeling Burping Lack of appetite or weight loss Nausea Bloody or dark poop Vomiting Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms."
284,How can certain pain relievers cause peptic ulcers?,"They include ibuprofen and naproxen. NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such as acetaminophen, won't lead to peptic ulcers. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol also can make you more likely to get ulcers. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history."
285,Does pregnancy affect irritable bowel syndrome?,"Hormone levels rise when you're expecting, so your IBS symptoms may improve. Some research shows that you're able to handle more pain during pregnancy. This could mean you have fewer cramps and less discomfort. But moms-to-be also tend get constipated more often."
285,How do sex hormones affect irritable bowel syndrome?,"Estrogen and progesterone affect IBS symptoms in a few ways, from how your intestines work to how much pain you feel. Cells in your gut have things called receptors that let these hormones latch on to them. This suggests that your digestive system is designed to sense and react to them. Here are the main ways they affect IBS: Digestion: They control the smooth muscle in your intestines, which dictates how quickly food travels through your system. In one study, animals took longer to empty their intestines when they received a low dose of the hormones than when they got a higher one. This may explain why low levels of sex hormones can lead to constipation. Pain level: These hormones affect how much your cramps bother you. A dip lowers your pain threshold, in part because estrogen boosts the production of serotonin, a feel-good chemical in your brain. A jump in estrogen can reduce some of the ouch factor, so your bellyaches or cramps don't hurt as much. Inflammation: Sex hormones can raise levels of inflammation throughout your body. That makes your IBS symptoms worse. Most research has linked estrogen and progesterone with IBS. But scientists have also found that male sex hormones, like testosterone, may protect against the condition. This may be partly why men are less likely to get the disorder."
285,Does gender play a role in irritable bowel syndrome?,"A growing body of research shows that sex hormones, like estrogen and progesterone, may be the reason. They can trigger IBS symptoms, which may explain why you have more flare-ups at different points of your menstrual cycle. To make matters worse, IBS patients with painful periods, a condition called dysmenorrhea, are twice as likely to have this increase in symptoms."
285,How does menopause affect irritable bowel syndrome?,"IBS worsens as hormone levels fall. But it's unclear how this affects IBS. In some women IBS improves after menopause, when these hormonal changes stop. On the other hand, more than a third of menopausal women in one recent study reported IBS-type symptoms, like gas and heartburn. Experts say that more research is needed on the topic."
286,How do you identify asthma triggers?,Your doctor may also do blood testing or ask you to use a device called a peak flow meter. It measures how much air you exhale and how quickly it comes out. It can alert you to changes in your breathing and the onset of asthma symptoms.
286,Can allergies trigger asthma?,"Eighty percent of people with asthma have allergies to things in the air, like tree, grass, and weed pollens, mold, animal dander, dust mites, and cockroach droppings. In one study, children with high levels of cockroach poop in their homes were four times more likely to have childhood asthma than children with low levels."
286,Can heartburn trigger asthma?,"Up to 89% of people with asthma also have severe heartburn (you might hear your doctor call it gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD). If the acids reach your throat or airways the irritation and inflammation they cause could trigger an asthma attack. Certain clues that suggest reflux as the cause of asthma include the onset of asthma in adulthood, no family history of asthma, no history of allergies or bronchitis, difficult-to-control asthma, or coughing while lying down. Stress and asthma are often seen together."
286,Can infections trigger asthma?,"Cold, flu, bronchitis, and sinus can cause an asthma attack. You may be more likely to have an attack for up to two months after an upper respiratory infection."
286,What causes asthma?,The causes can vary from person to person. No one knows for sure. Allergies play a role for many people as do genetics. Strong emotions. It can alert you to changes in your breathing and the onset of asthma symptoms.
287,When should you see a doctor about a yeast infection?,"See a doctor to be sure it's not a more serious problem that needs a different treatment, such as a urinary tract infection or STI. You're pregnant. Any medications, including over-the-counter vaginal creams, need to be approved by your doctor during pregnancy. You often get yeast infections. If you have four or more yeast infections in a year, doctors call it ârecurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.â If you have it, you'll need treatment for up to 6 months with an antifungal medication. Frequent yeast infections can also be a sign that you have diabetes or another medical condition. If you're concerned about your symptoms or they're different from past yeast infections you've had, you may want to see your doctor for your own peace of mind. Because symptoms are uncomfortable, some women will ask for a prescription-strength vaginal cream to ease the itching and burning more quickly than an over-the-counter product would. Some things you can do to prevent yeast infections may also treat a yeast infection once you have it."
287,What should you know about treating a yeast infection?,"Just know the three situations in which you should see a doctor, and then you can get started. If you're sure you have a yeast infection based on a past episode, you could try an over-the-counter medication to treat your symptoms."
287,What are some self-care tips for a yeast infection?,"Eating yogurt with live cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus -- a natural, ""friendly"" bacteria -- may head off a yeast infection. Taking supplements with lactobacillus acidophilus may also help prevent them. Nonprescription treatments. If you're sure you have a yeast infection based on a past episode, you could try an over-the-counter medication to treat your symptoms."
288,Does radon gas cause lung cancer?,"Radon gas Radon gas is a natural, chemically inert gas that is a natural decay product of uranium. It decays to form products that emit a type of ionizing radiation. Radon gas is a known cause of lung cancer, with an estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon gas, or 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer-related deaths annually in the U. S. As with asbestos exposure, concomitant smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure. Radon gas can travel up through soil and enter homes through gaps in the foundation, pipes, drains, or other openings. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that one out of every 15 homes in the U. S. contains dangerous levels of radon gas. Radon gas is invisible and odorless, but can be detected with simple test kits."
288,How can smoking affect your risk of getting lung cancer?,"Smoking The incidence of lung cancer is strongly correlated with cigarette smoking, with about 90% of lung cancers arising as a result of tobacco use. The risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked over time; doctors refer to this risk in terms of pack-years of smoking history (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked). For example, a person who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history. While the risk of lung cancer is increased with even a 10 pack-year smoking history, those with 30 pack-year histories or more are considered to have the greatest risk for the development of lung cancer. Among those who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes per day, one in seven will die of lung cancer. But even though the risk is higher the more you smoke, there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke."

But even though the risk is higher the more you smoke, there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke."
288,Does pipe and cigar smoking cause lung cancer?,"Pipe and cigar smoking can also cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with cigarettes. While someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar smokers have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker."
288,How can pipe and cigar smoking affect your risk of getting lung cancer?,"Pipe and cigar smoking can also cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with cigarettes. While someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar smokers have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker."
288,Do survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk of developing lung cancer?,"Prior history of lung cancer Survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk than the general population of developing a second lung cancer. Survivors of non-small cell lung cancers have an added risk of 1%-2% per year for developing a second lung cancer. In survivors of small cell lung cancers, the risk for development of second cancers approaches 6% per year."
288,Is there a familial predisposition to lung cancer?,"Familial predisposition While the majority of lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, the fact that not all smokers eventually develop lung cancer suggests that other factors, such as individual genetic susceptibility, may play a role in the causation of lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population."
288,How can tobacco smoke affect your risk of getting lung cancer?,"Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemical compounds, many of which have been shown to be cancer-causing, or carcinogenic. The two primary carcinogens in tobacco smoke are chemicals known as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The risk of developing lung cancer decreases each year following smoking cessation as normal cells grow and replace damaged cells in the lung. In former smokers, the risk of developing lung cancer begins to approach that of a nonsmoker about 15 years after cessation of smoking."
288,How can passive smoking affect your risk for lung cancer?,"Passive smoking Passive smoking, or the inhalation of secondhand tobacco smoke from other smokers sharing living or working quarters, is also an established risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung cancer when compared with other nonsmokers. An estimated 7,300 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U. S. that are attributable to passive smoking."

Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population."
288,How can asbestos fibers affect your risk for lung cancer?,"Asbestos fibers Asbestos fibers are silicate fibers that can persist for a lifetime in lung tissue following exposure to asbestos. The workplace is a common source of exposure to asbestos fibers, as asbestos was widely used in the past for both thermal and acoustic insulation materials. Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries including the Unites States. Both lung cancer and mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in exposed workers. Asbestos workers who do not smoke have a fivefold greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smokers, and those asbestos workers who smoke have a risk that is 50 to 90 times greater than non-smokers."
288,Does lung disease cause lung cancer?,"Lung disease The presence of certain diseases of the lung, notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD), is associated with a slightly increased risk (four to six times the risk of a nonsmoker) for the development of lung cancer even after the effects of concomitant cigarette smoking are excluded."
289,What should you do to diet for losing weight?,"For your diet: Eat more fruits and vegetables. Get good protein and plenty of fiber. Limit salt, sugar, and fat. Be careful with your portions. Talk to your doctor about how many calories you should consume to lose weight. For women it's generally up to 1,500 calories a day; for men it's up to 1,800. You'll need to cut your calories by 500 to 1,000 calories a day to lose that 1-2 pounds per week."
289,What is body mass index (BMI) and how do you calculate it?,"The first is called body mass index ( BMI). To figure out your BMI, just use this math formula: Multiply your weight in pounds by 703 and divide it by your height (in inches) squared. So, for example, if you weigh 185 pounds and are 5-foot-5 (65 inches), then your BMI works out this way: 185 x 703 = 130,055 65 x 65 = 4,225 130,005 Ã· 4,225 = 30.78 (round up to 30.8) Obesity in adults is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 or above. The other ranges are: Overweight = 25.0 to 29.9 Normal weight = 18.5 to 24.9 Underweight = under 18.5 BMI is a common tool to give you some idea of where you are."
289,How much exercise should you get to maintain a healthy weight?,"For movement: Aim for at least 2.5 hours of aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) every week. You'll likely need even more than that to lose weight. Do some muscle strengthening at least twice a week. Add ordinary movement to that, as well, to burn calories throughout the day. ( Park far from entrances. Take walks around the neighborhood. Get up from your desk and move regularly)."
289,What are the most important things I can do to lose weight in a healthy way?,"So there are two things you must change to lose weight in a healthy and lasting way: Eat right. Americans love fast food, sodas and processed foods. They add up. Move more. Our lifestyles can be short on exercise, playing, or just moving enough to burn the fuel we take in."
289,Can measuring my waist help me know if I am a healthy weight?,"The country's obesity problem is well known: 1 in 3 of us is obese, and the rate is rising. But it doesn't measure body fat. But in general, here are the guidelines for men and women: A man's waist should be no more than 40 inches If you're a woman who isn't pregnant, it should be no more than 35 inches."
289,How common is obesity?,"Talk to your doctor about how many calories you should consume to lose weight. Healthy living is a way of life, and the benefits are worth it."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by epididymitis?,"Epididymitis: This is swelling in the tube where sperm is stored -- the epididymis. Most often, an infection causes the problem. Signs and symptoms can include: Pain on one side of the scrotum that comes on slowly. Pain while peeing Fever Milky discharge from your penis Orchitis: It's swelling in one or both testicles."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by kidney infection?,"Kidney infection: This usually happens when an infection travels from your bladder and enters one or both of your kidneys. Symptoms may include groin pain, frequent urination, and blood or pus in your pee. The bacterium called E. coli is often to blame. Kidney infections are treated with antibiotics."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by prostatitis?,"Prostatitis: This is swelling or infection in your prostate gland. In addition to pain, you may have a hard time peeing."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by kidney stones?,Kidney stones: These are small crystals that form in your kidney and can get stuck in tubes leading to your bladder. The pain can be severe. It's usually in your back or belly but can be felt in your scrotum or at the tip of your penis.
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by testicular torsion?,"Testicular torsion: This happens when a testicle gets twisted inside your scrotum. It may feel like you got kicked in the crotch. It's a medical emergency. The twisting (torsion) cuts off the blood supply to your testicle. If it's not surgically untwisted within a few hours, your testicle can die. It happens most often in teen boys."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by testicular cancer?,"Testicular cancer: Most of the time, this cancer causes a painless lump in or on your testicle. But sometimes, it's painful."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by hip problems?,"Hip problems: Sometimes, hip pain from arthritis or another problem can radiate to your groin. It usually builds slowly and may feel worse when you're driving or sitting in a low chair. Usually, physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications are tried first to treat the problem. You may need an operation if these don't work."
290,When should you call the doctor about pain around your groin?,"The groin pain is very bad or it doesn't get better in a few days There's swelling or a lump around or in your testicle Pain in your side moves into your groin and testicle There's blood in your urine Go to the emergency room if you have sudden or intense pain; the pain radiates to you back, abdomen, or chest; or you have pain along with fever, chills, and nausea."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by orchitis?,"Pain while peeing Fever Milky discharge from your penis Orchitis: It's swelling in one or both testicles. The same infection that's behind epididymitis may cause this problem. The two conditions can happen at the same time. Sometimes, the mumps virus triggers orchitis. It can cause fertility problems. If bacteria is the cause of either condition, an antibiotic can clear it up."
290,How can you tell if pain around your groin is caused by an inguinal hernia?,"Common ones include: Inguinal hernia: This happens when fat or a loop of your intestine pushes through a weak spot in the muscles of your lower abdomen (belly). You may see a bulge in your groin or scrotum. One quarter of all men will develop this problem sometime during their lifetime. If the intestine or fat gets stuck in the abdominal muscle wall, its blood supply may get cut off. That's called a strangulated hernia. Symptoms can include: Redness or sudden pain near the bulge You can't poop or pass gas Nausea, vomiting, fever Get urgent care if you have any of these symptoms. A strangulated hernia is a life-threatening emergency. The hernia can be fixed with surgery. The groin pain is very bad or it doesn't get better in a few days There's swelling or a lump around or in your testicle Pain in your side moves into your groin and testicle There's blood in your urine Go to the emergency room if you have sudden or intense pain; the pain radiates to you back, abdomen, or chest; or you have pain along with fever, chills, and nausea."
290,Why does my groin hurt?,"The pain may happen right away or build over time. Continuing the sport or activity may make the injury worse. Rest, anti-inflammatory medications (aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen), rehabilitation, and strengthening exercises can often treat the problem successfully. One quarter of all men will develop this problem sometime during their lifetime. The groin pain is very bad or it doesn't get better in a few days There's swelling or a lump around or in your testicle Pain in your side moves into your groin and testicle There's blood in your urine Go to the emergency room if you have sudden or intense pain; the pain radiates to you back, abdomen, or chest; or you have pain along with fever, chills, and nausea."
291,"What makes up the spine, or backbone?","The spine, or backbone, is made up of a column of 33 bones and tissue extending from the skull to the pelvis. These bones, or vertebrae, enclose and protect a cylinder of nerve tissues known as the spinal cord. Between each one of the vertebra is an intervertebral disk, or band of cartilage serving as a shock absorber between the vertebrae."
291,What causes back pain?,"Some causes of back pain include accidents, muscle strains, and sports injuries."
291,What are the types of vertebrae in the backbone?,"The types of vertebrae are: Cervical vertebrae: the seven vertebrae forming the upper part of the spine Thoracic vertebrae: the 12 bones between the neck and the lower back Lumbar vertebrae: the five largest and strongest vertebrae located in the lower back between the chest and hips The sacrum and coccyx are the bones at the base of the spine. The sacrum is made up of five vertebrae fused together, while the coccyx (tailbone) is formed from four fused vertebrae."
291,How is back pain diagnosed?,"In addition to performing a complete history and physical exam for your back pain, your doctor may suggest one of the following diagnostic studies: X-rays, which can be used to provide detail of the bone structures in the spine and to check for instability (such as spondylolisthesis, see below), tumors, and fractures CT scans, which can identify specific conditions, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis MRI scans, which can provide details about the backs' discs and nerve roots. MRI scans are most commonly used for pre-surgical planning A number of other imaging and electrical studies may also be used to identify back problems, and some injections are used for diagnostic purposes as well as for pain relief."
291,What are the symptoms of spondylolisthesis?,Symptoms of spondylolithesis may include: Lower back pain Muscle tightness and stiffness Pain in the buttocks Pain radiating down the legs (due to pressure on nerve roots) Muscle weakness Spondylolisthesis is treated with the strengthening of supportive abdominal and back muscles through physical therapy.
291,What are the causes of cervical radiculopathy?,"In cervical radiculopathy, damage can occur as a result of pressure from material from a ruptured disc, degenerative changes in bones, arthritis, or other injuries that put pressure on the nerve roots. In older people, normal degenerative changes in the discs can cause pressure on nerve roots. In younger people, cervical radiculopathy tends to be the result of a ruptured disc. This disc material then compresses the nerve root, causing pain."
291,What are the treatments for cervical radiculopathy?,"Cervical radiculopathy may be treated with a combination of pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol), or nonsteroidal pain medication such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen ( Frotek), naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn), and physical therapy. Steroids may be prescribed either orally or injected epidurally (into the epidural space that surrounds the spinal cord). Physical therapy might include gentle cervical traction and mobilization, exercises, and other modalities to reduce pain. If significant compression on the nerve exists to the extent that motor weakness results, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure."
291,What are the two types of back injury?,"Some causes of back pain include accidents, muscle strains, and sports injuries. Two main types of back injury include: Spondylolisthesis: This is a slipping of vertebra that occurs, in most cases, at the base of the spine."
291,What are the causes of spondylolisthesis?,"MRI scans are most commonly used for pre-surgical planning A number of other imaging and electrical studies may also be used to identify back problems, and some injections are used for diagnostic purposes as well as for pain relief. A vertebra might be defective from the time a person is born, or a vertebra may be broken by trauma or a stress fracture. In addition, vertebrae can be broken down by infection or disease."
291,What are the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy?,Cervical Radiculopathy: Cervical radiculopathy is the damage or disturbance of nerve function that results if one of the nerve roots near the cervical vertebrae is compressed. Symptoms of spondylolithesis may include: Lower back pain Muscle tightness and stiffness Pain in the buttocks Pain radiating down the legs (due to pressure on nerve roots) Muscle weakness Spondylolisthesis is treated with the strengthening of supportive abdominal and back muscles through physical therapy.
292,What are targeted treatments for low back pain?,"Physical therapy or chiropractic can bring relief for many. These targeted treatments may include: Ice or heat Massage Ultrasound or electrical stimulation A specific program of stretching and strengthening exercises Spinal manipulation A doctor, physical therapist, or other health care professional can guide you in a safe back exercise program."
292,What are treatments for low back pain?,"What you need for treatment depends on the cause of your low back pain. Your doctor may recommend temporary use of medications to relieve pain. These might include over-the counter medicines such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Sometimes, stronger medications may be prescribed for pain treatment. If pain is severe or lasts, you may need oral or injected steroids."
292,What are symptoms of low back pain?,"Here's a quick overview of low back pain culprits: Overuse of muscles and ligaments, caused by a competitive tennis match or an ambitious day in the garden Disk injury, tears or other damage to the ""shock absorbers"" between the spinal bones (vertebrae) Disk degeneration, the wear and tear, shrinking, and collapse of disks that can be more common with age Degenerative spondylolisthesis, changes to spinal structures, which allows a vertebra to slip forward from the next vertebra Spinal stenosis, narrowing of the space around the spinal cord, which puts pressure on nerve roots Scoliosis, an abnormal curvature of the spine that may cause pain for some people Low back pain symptoms vary greatly from person to person. They are different depending upon the cause of the pain. Your pain may be dull or sharp. It may come and go. And depending upon its source, pain may get worse with standing, sitting, bending, or walking. Pain can even extend into your buttock or leg. Along with this shooting pain may come feelings of numbness, tingling, or weakness down your leg. Called sciatica, these symptoms may be a common result of a herniated disk in the lower back, where the disk bulges out toward the spinal canal."
293,How can I treat allergy symptoms?,"For mild allergy symptoms, such as hay fever or hives, give an over-the-counter ( OTC) antihistamine. For stuffy nose, give an OTC decongestant. For itchy, watery eyes, use OTC allergy eye drops. For itchy allergic rash, apply cold compresses and an OTC hydrocortisone cream."
294,What are disadvantages of rigid gas-permeable lenses?,"the lenses don't feel as comfortable as soft contacts. It takes longer to get used to them, so you need to wear them every day."
294,What are risks of soft contact lenses?,"Soft contact lens material can absorb particles, chemicals, bacteria, and mold more easily than both hard and rigid gas-permeable lenses. They soak up all kinds of things that can irritate your eyes -- smoke and sprays in the air and lotion or soap on your hands. Soft contacts are also more fragile. They can rip or tear more easily than hard or gas-permeable lenses."
294,What are color tint lenses?,"Color tint lenses are darker, opaque, and change the color of your eyes. Specialty colors include amethyst, violet, and green."
294,What are visibility tint lenses?,Visibility tint lenses have a tiny bit of color so you can find your lens if you drop it. It isn't enough to affect the color of your eyes.
294,What are advantages of rigid gas-permeable lenses?,You might see better than you do with soft lenses. They correct substantial astigmatism. They're easy to take care of and durable.
294,What are rigid gas-permeable lenses?,"As the name suggests, these are stiffer than soft contacts. They're made from silicone, and they're designed to let oxygen pass through to your cornea."
294,What are enhancement tint lenses?,Enhancement tint lenses play up your natural eye color.
294,What are daily disposables?,"Daily disposables are soft contacts that you wear only for a day and then throw away. That means you don't have to clean them regularly or risk dry eyes and irritation from contact solutions. If you have allergies, they may be the best choice for you."
294,What contact lenses can reshape your cornea?,"But the results only last while you have the contact in. This procedure isn't widely used, because laser vision correction offers the same result in less time and is permanent. Laser surgery is now OK for professionals -- like members of the military or airline pilots -- whose jobs didn't allow them to have it in the past. If you can't have laser surgery, ask your eye care professional if ortho-k could work for you."
294,What are toric lenses for astigmatism?,"You can wear contacts even if you have presbyopia and need bifocals. They're made from silicone, and they're designed to let oxygen pass through to your cornea. They come in soft or rigid gas-permeable forms, extended wear, daily disposable, and even in colored lenses. Like bifocal lenses in a pair of glasses, toric lenses have two powers in one lens: one that corrects your astigmatism, and another for nearsightedness or farsightedness."
294,What are monovision lenses?,"You won't have the same prescription in both eyes. One will have a contact for distance vision, and the other will be for seeing up close. This can take a while to get used to. Each eye works on its own. You might have problems with depth perception. Another monovision option: Wear a bifocal lens in one eye, and a single-vision lens in the other. This makes driving easier."
294,What are the benefits of soft contact lenses?,"Many soft lenses are disposable, so you can throw them away after using them for a short time. Having a fresh pair of soft contacts means less chance of infection, less cleaning, and more comfort. Compared with rigid gas-permeable lenses, the other main type of contacts, soft lenses feel better when you first put them in. As a bonus, many soft lenses provide UV protection."
294,What are silicone-based soft contact lenses?,"The water content lets oxygen pass through the lens to your cornea. Many soft lenses are disposable, so you can throw them away after using them for a short time. Soft contacts are also more fragile. That means you don't have to clean them regularly or risk dry eyes and irritation from contact solutions. Your cornea gets less oxygen when you sleep in contacts, so the risk of serious complications is higher."
295,What are common symptoms of heart failure?,"Some people with heart failure don't experience symptoms, but here are some of the more common signs: Shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest or when lying down Swollen legs, ankles, or abdomen Dry, hacking cough, or wheezing Other symptoms may include: Fatigue, palpitations, or pain during normal activities Weight gain from fluid retention Increased need to urinate during the night Dizziness or confusion Rapid or irregular heartbeats Your legs, ankles, or abdomen are swollen You have difficulty breathing, especially if you wake up short of breath, or you cannot lie down flat without getting short of breath You gain 2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week You have a feeling of fullness (bloating) in your stomach with a loss of appetite or nausea You feel extreme fatigue or decreased ability to complete daily activities You have a respiratory infection or a cough that has become worse Your heart rate is fast, above 100 beats per minute You experience a new irregular heart beat You feel chest pain or discomfort during activity that is relieved with rest You notice changes in sleep patterns, including difficulty sleeping or lying flat in bed, or needing to sleep a lot more than usual You urinate less You feel restless or confused You suffer constant dizziness or lightheadedness You have nausea or poor appetite"
296,How effective is medical marijuana for fibromyalgia?,"In addition, people with fibromyalgia often wonder if medical marijuana, which can be prescribed by physicians in some states, can help their chronic pain and fatigue. While medical marijuana doesn't cure diseases like fibromyalgia, some pain experts say it may work against pain, help people sleep better, and improve mood. Other pain specialists see no role for medical marijuana in pain management and express concern that people don't know what they're getting when they buy it."""
296,Is fibromyalgia pain similar to arthritis pain?,"Consequently, some experts group fibromyalgia with arthritis and related disorders. The pain associated with these other conditions is typically localized to a single area, while the pain and stiffness of fibromyalgia are very widespread and consists of deep muscle pain, morning stiffness, and painful tender points, making it difficult to exercise or be physically active. It can also cause insomnia and dizziness."
297,What do I need to know about using a surrogate mother?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } There's still some controversy about using a surrogate mother to have a baby. The legal process is also tricky because it varies from state to state. Even so, whether it's because of fertility problems or other reasons, surrogacy is an option for you and your partner. Find out how it works and see if it's right for you."
297,How can I choose a surrogate mother?,"Right now there aren't any regulations about who can be a surrogate mother. But experts agree on a few points about how to select one. You should choose a surrogate who: Is at least 21 years old Has already given birth to at least one healthy baby so she understands firsthand the medical risks of pregnancy and childbirth and the emotional issues of bonding with a newborn Has passed a psychological screening by a mental health professional to uncover any issues with giving up the baby after birth Signs a contract about her role and responsibilities in the pregnancy, such as prenatal care and agreeing to give you the baby after birth The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says a surrogate should get a medical exam to check that she's likely to have a healthy, full-term pregnancy."

The organization suggests she gets tests that check for infectious diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C. Surrogates should get tests to make sure they have immunity to measles, rubella ( German measles), and chickenpox. Also, you may want to ask that she get a medical procedure to visually ""map"" the uterus, which can help the doctor check her potential to carry a pregnancy. A surrogate mother should have her own doctor during pregnancy rather than use yours. The cost of surrogacy can range from $80,000 to $120,000. A lot of different things go into the price, such as whether the surrogate has her own medical insurance or whether you need to buy a surrogacy-pregnancy policy for her."
297,Who uses surrogates?,"If you're a woman, you may consider a surrogate for several reasons: Medical problems with your uterus You had a hysterectomy that removed your uterus Conditions that make pregnancy impossible or risky for you, such as severe heart disease You may want to think about surrogacy if you tried but couldn't get pregnant with a variety of assisted-reproduction techniques, such as IVF. Surrogates have also made parenthood an option for people who might not be able to adopt a child, perhaps because of their age or marital status. If gay men decide to use a traditional surrogate, one of them uses his sperm to fertilize the surrogate's egg through artificial insemination. The surrogate then carries the baby and gives birth. A gay couple might also choose an egg donor, fertilize that donated egg, and then have the embryo implanted in a gestational surrogate to carry until birth."
297,How can a surrogacy agency help me to find a surrogate mother?,"If gay men decide to use a traditional surrogate, one of them uses his sperm to fertilize the surrogate's egg through artificial insemination. There are about 100 agencies now operating in the U. S. They act as go-betweens. An agency helps you find a surrogate and make arrangements. It also collects any fees that get passed between you and the surrogate, such as paying for her medical expenses."
297,Where can I find a surrogate mother?,"Gestational surrogates. There are several ways you can find a surrogate mother: Friends or family. Sometimes you can ask a friend or relative to be a surrogate for you. It's somewhat controversial. It generally discourages surrogacy, though, if the child would carry the same genes as a child born of incest between close relatives."
298,When should I call my doctor about bursitis?,"Common symptoms of bursitis include: Pain and (rarely) swelling in the shoulders, elbows, hips, or knees, particularly stretching or extending the joint while exercising, lifting, or otherwise pushing the joint to its limits Restricted or lost range of motion in a joint, especially affecting the shoulder, with or without immediate pain Muscle weakness due to pain Pain in or near a joint persists more than two weeks.

299,What are the side effects of taking alpha-lipoic acid?,"Side effects. Generally, side effects are uncommon. These supplements could cause nausea, dizziness, or a rash. Topical alpha-lipoic acid can irritate the skin."
299,How safe is alpha-lipoic acid?,"So far, the evidence is not clear."
299,What is alpha-lipoic acid?,"Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that's in many foods, and it's made naturally in our bodies. For many years, high doses of alpha-lipoic acid supplements have been used in parts of Europe for certain types of nerve damage. Studies suggest that they might also help with type 2 diabetes."
299,What interactions can happen from taking alpha-lipoic acid?,"If you take any medicines or supplements regularly, see your doctor before you start using alpha-lipoic acid. People with diabetes need to be especially careful. Using it along with diabetes drugs could make blood sugar levels drop too low. Alpha-lipoic acid might also decrease the effect of some chemotherapy drugs. It could also interact with certain antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, tranquilizers, vasodilators (used for heart disease or high blood pressure), and drugs for osteoarthritis."
299,How much alpha-lipoic acid should you take?,"Because alpha-lipoic acid is an unproven treatment, there is no established dose. However, studies have used between 600-1,800 milligrams daily for diabetes and neuropathy; one review concluded that the evidence is convincing for the use of 600 milligrams daily for three weeks on symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Some studies have used intravenous alpha-lipoic acid instead of oral supplements."
299,What are the risks associated with taking alpha-lipoic acid?,"Your doctor might want to test your glucose levels regularly while you use alpha-lipoic acid supplements. If you have thyroid problems, a thiamine deficiency (sometimes found in alcoholics or those with anorexia, for example), or any other medical issue, talk to your doctor before you start taking alpha-lipoic acid supplements. Interactions. If you take any medicines or supplements regularly, see your doctor before you start using alpha-lipoic acid."
299,What are the effects of long-term use of alpha-lipoic acid?,"Studies suggest that they might also help with type 2 diabetes. However, more research needs to be done. Alpha-lipoic acid might also decrease the effect of some chemotherapy drugs."
299,Can you get alpha-lipoic acid naturally from foods?,"Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that's in many foods, and it's made naturally in our bodies. They include spinach, broccoli, yams, potatoes, yeast, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots, beets, and rice bran. Red meat -- and particularly organ meat -- is also a source of alpha-lipoic acid."

301,"When should you call your doctor or dermatologist about poison ivy, oak, or sumac?","Call your doctor or a dermatologist for: Severe blistering, swelling, and itching Symptoms in sensitive areas such as the eyes, lips, throat, or genitals Fever A rash over large areas of your body A rash lasting longer than a week to 10 days Blisters that become infected with pus Get immediate medical help for any difficulty breathing or severe coughing after exposure to burning plants."
301,"How are rashes from poison ivy, oak, and sumac treated?","Self-care for a mild rash includes: Wash the area well with mild soap and lukewarm water as soon as possible after contact. Wash all clothes, shoes, socks, tools, pets, and toys that may have become contaminated. Cool compresses may help during the blistering phase. Use a topical corticosteroid cream on the rash as directed by your doctor. Try calamine lotion for the itching, but avoid skin products that contain anesthetics or antihistamines, which can cause their own allergic reaction. To help relieve the itch, try cool showers or a mixture of baking soda and water applied to the area. If sleep is a problem because of the itching, try an over-the-counter oral antihistamine at night."

This rash is a form of allergic contact dermatitis. Dermatitis simply means an irritation of the skin. It's called ""allergic contact dermatitis"" because the rash is caused by contact with a substance to which you're allergic."
301,"What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction to poison ivy, oak, and sumac?","Three types of transmission can occur: Direct contact with the plant Indirect contact when you touch pets, gardening tools, sports equipment, or other objects that had direct contact with the plant Airborne contact from burning these plants, which releases particles of urushiol into the air that can penetrate the skin, eyes, nose, throat, or respiratory system Symptoms, which generally last from one to two weeks, include: Red streaks or patches Itching Rash Swelling Blisters that may ""weep"" (leak fluid) and later crust over Inflammation and a burning sensation Does it matter which plant you're exposed to?"
301,"How are poison ivy, oak, and sumac rashes diagnosed?","Poison ivy, oak, and sumac are generally diagnosed by their common symptoms of a rash, blisters, and itching following activity outside in a forest or field, but if you have any doubt, ask your doctor."
301,"How can I prevent rashes from poison ivy, oak, and sumac?","Remember the old adage: "" Leaflets three, let them be."" Poison ivy and poison oak have a triple-leaf structure you can learn to recognize -- and then avoid. Avoid any contact with these plants when possible. Cover your skin completely when hiking, camping, or working in forests and around shrubs; wear long sleeves, long pants, gloves, socks, and boots. Remember that you can also get a rash from indirect contact from clothes, pets, or tools that have urushiol on them. Ask your doctor about over-the-counter skin products that contain a barrier such as bentoquatam to help protect the skin from urushiol if you work outside in forestry or other jobs at risk of frequent exposure."
301,"What causes the rashes of poison ivy, oak, and sumac?","Urushiol quickly penetrates the skin, often leaving red lines that show where you brushed against the plant. Symptoms appear 24 to 72 hours after exposure. Scratching the itchy rash doesn't cause it to spread but can prolong skin healing and cause a secondary infection. The rash isn't contagious, so you won't spread it to others by going to school or work. Poison ivy, oak, and sumac are generally diagnosed by their common symptoms of a rash, blisters, and itching following activity outside in a forest or field, but if you have any doubt, ask your doctor."
302,How are shin splints treated?,"Rest your body. It needs time to heal. Ice your shin to ease pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days, or until the pain is gone. Use insoles or orthotics for your shoes. Shoe inserts -- which can be custom-made or bought off the shelf -- may help if your arches collapse or flatten when you stand up. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers, if you need them. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, will help with pain and swelling."
302,What causes shin splints?,"This common problem can result from: Flat feet -- when the impact of a step makes your foot's arch collapse (your doctor will call this overpronation) Shoes that don't fit well or provide good support Working out without warmup or cooldown stretches Weak ankles, hips, or core muscles If you're active, you could get them if you make sudden changes like more intense, more frequent, or longer workouts."
302,How do I know if my shin splints are healed?,"Your injured leg feels as strong as your other leg. You can push hard on spots that used to be painful. You can jog, sprint, and jump without pain. There's no way to say exactly when your shin splints will go away. It depends on what caused them. People also heal at different rates; 3 to 6 months isn't unusual."
303,What happens when a person is quarantined?,"During quarantine people are able to do most things they can do indoors within the constraints of the location they are at. For example, if people are asked to stay at home then they would usually be asked to take their own temperature and report daily to health authorities on how they are feeling. They are given instructions on what they can do and not do around family members and are informed of other disease precautions."
303,What is quarantine?,"That is, they may be asked to remain at home or another location to prevent further spread of illness to others and to carefully monitor for the disease. These measures are implemented to contain and prevent the transmission of an infectious disease."
304,How is sleep paralysis diagnosed?,"Other factors that may be linked to sleep paralysis include: Lack of sleep Sleep schedule that changes Mental conditions such as stress or bipolar disorder Sleeping on the back Other sleep problems such as narcolepsy or nighttime leg cramps Use of certain medications, such as those for ADHD Substance abuse If you find yourself unable to move or speak for a few seconds or minutes when falling asleep or waking up, then it is likely you have isolated recurrent sleep paralysis. Often there is no need to treat this condition. Check with your doctor if you have any of these concerns: You feel anxious about your symptoms Your symptoms leave you very tired during the day Your symptoms keep you up during the night Your doctor may want to gather more information about your sleep health by doing any of the following: Ask you to describe your symptoms and keep a sleep diary for a few weeks Discuss your health history, including any known sleep disorders or any family history of sleep disorders Refer you to a sleep specialist for further evaluation Conduct overnight sleep studies or daytime nap studies to make sure you do not have another sleep disorder Most people need no treatment for sleep paralysis."
304,What happens with hypnopompic sleep paralysis?,"NREM sleep occurs first and takes up to 75% of your overall sleep time. During NREM sleep, your body relaxes and restores itself. At the end of NREM, your sleep shifts to REM. Your eyes move quickly and dreams occur, but the rest of your body remains very relaxed. Your muscles are ""turned off"" during REM sleep. If you become aware before the REM cycle has finished, you may notice that you cannot move or speak."

Almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night. People have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep-time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror. Other factors that may be linked to sleep paralysis include: Lack of sleep Sleep schedule that changes Mental conditions such as stress or bipolar disorder Sleeping on the back Other sleep problems such as narcolepsy or nighttime leg cramps Use of certain medications, such as those for ADHD Substance abuse If you find yourself unable to move or speak for a few seconds or minutes when falling asleep or waking up, then it is likely you have isolated recurrent sleep paralysis.

She'll want to know: When and where they pop up How long they last Possible triggers If you have swelling What other symptoms you have If you're taking new meds She'll also ask about the foods you eat and if you have pets, to see if an allergy is to blame. She may check for other illnesses or conditions that could be causing the hives, like an overactive or underactive thyroid."
305,What are some common triggers of chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives)?,"Even though doctors can't say for sure what causes CIU, they do know things that can lead to flare-ups. They include: Alcoholic drinks Tight clothing Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS) like aspirin and ibuprofen Exercise Cold Heat If you've had hives for several weeks and don't know why, see your doctor."
305,What is chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives)?,"They're often caused by an allergic reaction to a food or drug. Usually, they go away quickly. For a small number of people, though, hives come back again and again, with no known cause. When new outbreaks happen almost every day for 6 weeks or more, it's called chronic idiopathic urticaria ( CIU). Some people get chronic hives at the same time that they get other problems like thyroid disease, hormonal problems, or cancer."
306,What causes night blindness?,"The problem comes from a disorder of the cells in your retina that allow you to see dim light. It has many causes: Nearsightedness Glaucoma Glaucoma medications that close the pupil Cataracts Diabetes Retinitis pigmentosa Vitamin A deficiency Keratoconus To pinpoint the cause, your eye doctor will carry out a full exam."
307,How can reducing cholesterol help improve your erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"You can lower your cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medication."
308,Why would you get allergy tests for asthma?,"They help your doctor find out if allergies trigger your asthma. These tests won't identify asthma triggers such as exercise, stress, or illnesses like a cold. Allergy tests alone are not enough to make an asthma diagnosis."
308,What is a skin prick allergy test?,"Skin prick test: The skin prick test is the most common allergy skin test. First, you get a series of tiny drops of allergens on your skin, usually on your back. Then you get a quick needle prick in the skin underneath each drop. If you're allergic, you'll get a dime-sized hive that's red and itchy at the needle prick site. You may need a follow-up test to check the results."
308,What is a patch test for allergies?,"Patch test: Your doctor applies the allergen to a patch. You'll leave the patch on your skin for 48 hours. If your skin turns red, gets irritated, and itches, the chances are great that you have an allergy."
308,Why would you get allergy skin tests if you have asthma?,"Allergy tests are a way to get to the bottom of what's causing your asthma symptoms. Several types of allergy tests help with asthma, including skin tests and blood tests. If you have poorly controlled asthma, trouble breathing, or a high risk of anaphylactic reactions, your doctor may wait to do skin tests. Ask your doctor if you need to do anything before the test. For example, you should stop taking antihistamines before you get an allergy test. Your doctor may have other specific instructions, too. Intradermal test: If your skin prick test was negative, your doctor may try an intradermal test."
308,What is an intradermal allergy test?,"Intradermal test: If your skin prick test was negative, your doctor may try an intradermal test. Intradermal allergy tests are often used for environmental allergies and drug allergies. That means they show that you have an allergy when you actually don't. Intradermal tests are also more likely to cause an allergic reaction that affects your whole body."
309,How can you breathe better if you have heart failure?,"To breathe better: Listen to your body and slow down when you're short of breath. Take breaks throughout the day: read, pay bills, write letters, use the computer for fun. Use music, meditation, or yoga to ease stress. If you feel breathless, short of breath, or you have trouble breathing, talk to your doctor. He may ask you to eat less salt or drink less liquid for a couple of days. If neither of these helps, call your doctor. He may need to tweak your medicine."
310,What is intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET)?,"Intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae. Sometimes the discs can become damaged and cause pain. IDET uses heat to modify the nerve fibers of a spinal disc and to destroy pain receptors in the area. In this procedure, a wire called an electrothermal catheter is placed through an incision in the disc. An electrical current passes through the wire, heating a small outer portion of the disc to a temperature of 90 degrees Celsius. IDET is performed as an outpatient procedure while the patient is awake and under a local anesthesia."
310,What is radiofrequency discal nucleoplasty?,"Radiofrequency discal nucleoplasty is a newer procedure which utilizes a radio frequency probe instead of heating wire to disintegrate a small portion of the central disc material. The result of this intervention is partial decompression of the disc, which may help relieve pain caused by bulging discs pressing on nearby spinal nerve roots."
310,What is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy?,"One of the most common forms of electrical stimulation used for pain management is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS) therapy, which provides short-term pain relief. In TENS therapy for pain management, a small, battery-operated device delivers low-voltage electrical current through the skin via electrodes placed near the source of pain. The electricity from the electrodes stimulates nerves in the affected area and sends signals to the brain that ""scramble"" normal pain perception."
311,Why is rhinoplasty done?,"Types of rhinoplasty include: Removing a hump on the nose Straightening the bridge Reshaping the nose's tip Increasing or decreasing the size of the nostrils Correcting the nose after an injury Opening breathing passages Making the nose bigger or smaller Nose jobs can be done to change how you look or for medical reasons. For example, some people may need surgery to repair a problem with the cartilage that divides one nostril from the other. Others may just want to make their nose smaller."
311,What is rhinoplasty?,"Getting a ""nose job,"" which doctors call rhinoplasty, can be very simple or very complex. When done correctly by an experienced surgeon, it can make a big difference in how a person looks."
311,Where should I get rhinoplasty?,"It's best to have the procedure done in an accredited facility. If you have a complication, an experienced surgeon working with a well-trained team will be able to assess and correct the situation. You should talk to your surgeon in advance to describe your goals and learn about the risks and benefits."
311,What are risks of rhinoplasty?,"Any type of surgery has risks. These include bleeding, infection, and allergic reaction to anesthesia. Risks of rhinoplasty include: Numbness Nosebleeds Scarring at the base of the nose Bursting of small blood vessels on the skin's surface Swelling Permanent nerve damage Need for a second or third operation Before getting a nose job, teens and their parents or guardians should talk extensively with the surgeon and weigh all of the risks and benefits."
311,Should a teen get a nose job?,Teens should not have a nose job until the nose has reached its adult size. This normally happens at about age 15 or 16 for girls. It usually happens a year or so later for boys.
311,What are the types of rhinoplasty?,Types of rhinoplasty include: Removing a hump on the nose Straightening the bridge Reshaping the nose's tip Increasing or decreasing the size of the nostrils Correcting the nose after an injury Opening breathing passages Making the nose bigger or smaller Nose jobs can be done to change how you look or for medical reasons.
311,What is recovery from rhinoplasty like?,"After a nose job, recovery takes patience and support from family and friends. You will need to keep your head elevated for at least 24 hours after the operation. And there will be some pain and swelling (which can be managed with medication and cold compresses). Some people become discouraged with the swelling and how they look immediately after the operation. But when the swelling goes down, the redness disappears and the nose fully heals. This can take weeks, but most people like the results."
311,How to choose a surgeon for rhinoplasty?,Any type of surgery has risks. The American Board of Plastic Surgery ( ABPS) is the most common body that certifies rhinoplasty surgeons.
312,How can AFib lead to heart failure?,"When you have both, which is common, symptoms tend to be worse than when you have just one or the other. When you have AFib, your heart typically beats faster than normal, even when you're just resting. And since the heart's doing more of quiver than a strong push, it ends up sending out only a fraction of the blood it normally would. It's like the difference between a bunch of short, frantic bursts on a bike pump versus long, steady strokes."
312,Can AFib lead to heart failure?,"AFib can lead to heart failure, and heart failure puts you at greater risk for AFib. When you have both, which is common, symptoms tend to be worse than when you have just one or the other."
312,What other heart conditions increase your risk of heart failure and AFib?,"Your odds for heart failure and AFib go up if you have other heart conditions, such as: Coronary artery disease, where plaque builds up in your heart's arteries and leads to less blood flow Cardiomyopathy, which is damage to your heart muscle Heart valve problems, such as a leaky valve or a valve that doesn't fully open Myocarditis, where the muscles of your heart get swollen and irritated Other health conditions."
312,How can heart failure lead to AFib?,"It works in the other direction, too. Your heart's rhythm is controlled by electrical signals. For those signals to work well, they need healthy heart tissue. But heart failure can actually stretch your atria and cause tissue in your heart to thicken and scar. Those changes throw off the electrical signals, and that messes up the heart's rhythm and can cause AFib."
312,What are risks you can't control that raise your risks of heart failure and AFib?,"With heart failure, the muscles of your heart are too weak to pump enough blood, so you don't get the oxygen you need. But many people have both, and doctors aren't totally clear why. One reason may be that many of the same things raise your chances of having both conditions. Men are more likely to have these conditions than women."
312,What are other health conditions that increase your odds of heart failure and AFib?,"The two conditions are closely tied to each other. Other health issues can also raise your risk, such as: Diabetes, since it increases your odds for coronary artery disease and high blood pressure High blood pressure, which over time can weaken, stiffen, and thicken your heart tissue Obesity, as it often leads to higher blood pressure and raises your chances of having diabetes Overactive thyroid, because too much thyroid hormone can make your heart beat faster than normal Sleep apnea, which can lead to lower oxygen levels while you sleep and affect your heart's rhythm Smoking and drinking alcohol."
313,What is the best flu medication to take if you have heart disease?,"You have: Fever (usually high) Severe aches and pains in the joints and muscles and around the eyes Generalized weakness Warm, flushed skin and red, watery eyes Headache Dry cough Sore throat and watery discharge from the nose When you're shopping for an over-the-counter ( OTC) medication, check the label. Look for a product that's decongestant-free or made just for people with high blood pressure. Decongestants can raise your blood pressure and interfere with other medications.

However, fortunately, people with chronic fatigue syndrome do not have a defective immune system, in the way that people with HIV/ AIDS do. Blood pressure and pulse issues: On standing, people can have a drop in blood pressure and an increase in how fast the heart beats. Sometimes people feel like fainting or actually faint, if the blood pressure drops too low."
325,Do genes contribute to fatigue syndrome?,"Doctors don't know the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome, but they have identified different underlying abnormalities in people with the condition.

Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you're having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it's a way to measure your heart's electrical system. If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you've had."
326,What are the symptoms of bradycardia?,"The biggest concern is your heart isn't doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: Lightheadedness or dizziness Confusion or a hard time concentrating Fainting Shortness of breath (with or without chest pain) You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity."
326,What are the treatments for bradycardia?,"If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism, or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug. If these approaches don't work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker."
326,When should you see a doctor for bradycardia?,"If you or a loved one faints, has chest pains or trouble breathing, call 911.

If you wear out more easily now than you did a month or year ago, let her know."
326,What is bradycardia?,"But with bradycardia, it goes down to less than 60 beats a minute. This might not cause a problem for some people. But it could be a clue that you have an issue with the electrical system in your heart. You need to see a doctor who can figure out why it's beating slowly and if you should get treatment. You may exercise a lot, and a slow heart rate could be a sign of how fit you are."

To help prevent that: Encourage regular exercise, especially early in the disease, to help your loved one keep up their balance and strength. Remove objects that are easy to trip on, such as loose rugs or extension cords. Make sure stairways have at least one handrail. Place non-skid strips in the bathtub and on smooth floors. Install night-lights. Place easy-to-see stickers on large windows and sliding-glass doors to make it obvious that something solid is there."
327,How can you prevent someone with Alzheimer's disease from wandering?,"In the later stages of the disease, memory problems and confusion may give your loved one sudden urges to wander away from home.

Take these steps to help your loved one get some rest: Stick to a schedule. Ask his doctor or pharmacist if any of his prescriptions could affect sleep. In the later stages of the disease, memory problems and confusion may give your loved one sudden urges to wander away from home."
328,How is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs) diagnosed?,"No one test can identify a case of ARDS. It's more of a puzzle that a doctor has to piece together. Other conditions can have similar symptoms. To make a diagnosis, you doctor will probably begin by asking about your medical history. She'll then likely do a physical exam and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. She may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin There are various tests your doctor might order to help her reach a diagnosis."
328,How can you treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Treatment aims to get oxygen levels in your blood back up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. Doctors might start with an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), depending on exactly what you need. Other treatments might include: Nutrition and medicine through IV fluids Medicine to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medicine to keep you calm and comfortable People with ARDS are treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital."
328,What happens when you have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and builds up in the tiny air sacs in your lungs. Your lungs are then unable to fill up with enough air. Because of this, the blood traveling to your lungs can't pick up the amount of oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. That can lead to organs such as your kidneys or brain not working as they should or shutting down. Doctors aren't sure why some people get ARDS and others don't."
328,What tests are used to diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,She may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin There are various tests your doctor might order to help her reach a diagnosis. Some of them include: Scans: A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also get a computerized tomography ( CT) scan. These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is located. Blood tests: These can be used to check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia. Heart tests: These might be ordered to rule out things such as heart failure (when your heart doesn't pump blood to your body properly).
328,What are the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Some of the other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that requires a blood transfusion Inflammation of the pancreas Overdosing on cocaine and other drugs Near drowning Burns ARDS makes it hard to breathe and puts great strain on the lungs. So symptoms include shortness of breath, often severe. Other signs of ARDS include: Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in the blood Dizziness Lots of sweating While many people are already in a hospital when they get ARDS, you should get medical treatment at once if you have these symptoms or see them in a loved one."
328,What causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"Doctors are still trying to learn more about this condition and why it happens. It's not always clear what triggers a case. Most people who get ARDS are already in the hospital for something else. That's because it's usually caused by an injury or another illness. Some of the causes of ARDS may include: Sepsis: This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream, and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation, small blood clots, and bleeding. Accidents: Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or that part of your brain that handles breathing. Breathing in harmful substances: Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS."
328,What is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs)?,"It is serious, sometimes life-threatening, and can get worse quickly. But it's generally treatable and most people can recover from it. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important -- your organs need enough oxygen to work right and keep you going. Accidents: Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or that part of your brain that handles breathing."
329,What are the symptoms of mycoplasma genitalium (MG) in men?,"MG doesn't always cause symptoms, so it's possible to have it and not know it. In men, the symptoms are: Watery discharge from your penis Burning, stinging, or pain when you pee The symptoms for women are: Discharge from your vagina Pain during sex Bleeding after sex Bleeding between periods Pain in your pelvic area below your belly button Unlike other STDs, there is no test for MG that the FDA has approved."

329,Do condoms help reduce the chances of getting mycoplasma genitalium (MG)?,"Condoms can reduce your chance of getting MG, but they can't guarantee you won't get it. If you have the disease, avoid having sex for 7 days after you start treatment so you don't infect others."
329,What are complications from mycoplasma genitalium (MG)?,"MG can cause a number of complications: A problem that makes your urethra irritated, swollen, and itchy, called urethritis. It can happen to men and women. An infection of a woman's reproductive organs, called pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID), which can make it hard to get pregnant. An inflamed cervix, called cervicitis Scientists aren't sure if an MG infection can make it hard for men to get a woman pregnant."

When you're shopping, choose lean meats, fish, and poultry. Limit these to 5-7 ounces per day. Other good low-fat sources of protein include dried beans and peas, tofu, low-fat yogurt, low-fat or skim milk, low-fat cheese, and tuna packed in water. Choose foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, flaxseed, and walnuts for heart health. The American Heart Association recommends eating fatty fish such as salmon twice weekly for the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids."
330,What are tips for low-fat cooking?,"Trim all visible fat and remove the skin from poultry. Refrigerate soups, gravies, and stews, and remove the hardened fat on top before eating. Bake, broil, or grill meats on a rack that allows fat to drip from the meat. Don't fry foods. Sprinkle lemon juice, herbs, and spices on cooked vegetables instead of using cheese, butter, or cream-based sauces. Try plain, nonfat or low-fat yogurt and chives on baked potatoes rather than sour cream. Reduced-fat sour cream still has fat, so limit the amount you use."

The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is over-active in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis."
332,What causes meningitis?,"Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days and may include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can't lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Meningitis is almost always caused by a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, like your ears, sinuses, or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis It's an extremely serious illness."
332,What is fungal meningitis?,"Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. Someone with a problem with their immune system -- because they have AIDS, for example -- is more likely to become infected with this form of meningitis."
332,Who's more likely to get meningitis?,"Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults ages 16-25 Adults over 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen, long-term disease, or immune system disorders. Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease."
332,What are the different types of meningitis?,"There are several causes of this disease, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Bacterial meningitis can be life-threatening and spreads between people in close contact with each other. Viral meningitis tends to be less severe, and most people recover completely without treatment. Fungal meningitis is a rare form of the disease. It usually happens only in people whose immune system -- the body's defense against germs -- has been weakened."

Tilt your head back and pull your lower lid down with one hand. Hold the bottle or tube in your other hand. If you need to, rest part of your hand on your forehead to keep it steady. Place one drop or a little ointment inside your lower lid. Don't let the tip of the bottle or tube touch your eye. Blink and dab away any extra fluid with a tissue. If you have both drops and ointment, use the drops first. If you don't, the ointment may keep the eye drops from being absorbed. If you have more than one type of drop, wait about 5 minutes after the first medicine before you use the second. Keep your eyes closed for a few minutes. That lets the medicine get inside your eye. Wash your hands as soon as you're done to remove any medication still there. If you have any questions, talk to your eye doctor."

335,What are the possible causes of diastolic heart failure?,"So diastolic heart failure is more common as people get older. Other than normal aging, the most common causes are: High blood pressure : If you have it, your heart has to work harder to pump more blood through your body. That makes it stiffen. Coronary artery disease : The amount of blood flowing to your heart muscle is blocked or less than normal."
336,What are the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants and children?,"Feeling as if there is a lump in your throat Sudden increase of saliva Bad breath In infants and children, GERD can produce these symptoms: Recurrent vomiting Coughing Breathing problems A failure to thrive You regularly need to take over-the-counter medicine for heartburn or your heartburn symptoms persist after taking the drug Your symptoms also include weight loss, difficulty or pain when swallowing, dark-colored stools, or vomiting Seek immediate emergency medical help ( Call 911) for any chest pain or breathing problems."
336,What are the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Not everyone with GERD has heartburn, but the primary symptoms of GERD are heartburn, regurgitation, and an acid taste in the mouth. Heartburn usually is described as a burning pain in the middle of the chest. It may start high in the abdomen or may extend up the neck or back. Sometimes the pain may be sharp or pressure-like, rather than burning. Such pain can mimic heart pain (angina). Typically, heartburn related to GERD is seen more commonly after a meal. Other symptoms of GERD include: Hoarseness; if acid reflux gets past the upper esophageal sphincter, it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx), causing hoarseness or sore throat. Laryngitis Chronic dry cough, especially at night; GERD is a common cause of unexplained coughing. It is not clear how cough is caused or aggravated by GERD.

337,Why is it hard to tell if smoking marijuana causes cancer?,"Another problem is that many people who smoke marijuana also smoke tobacco, sometimes mixed in the same cigarette. So if they get lung cancer, it's impossible to sort out what substance caused it. Some marijuana smokers in the studies have been fairly young, which could skew the results. Cancers can take time to grow."
337,Can smoking marijuana prevent cancer?,"Animal research suggests that some chemicals in marijuana work against tumor growth, which could explain why lung cancer isn't showing up as often as scientists might expect in people who smoke it. The studies on this are in their early days, and researchers need to take a deeper look into this theory."
337,Can smoking marijuana cause lung cancer?,"Even as more people use it, health experts aren't sure whether smoking pot raises your odds of getting lung cancer. Tar, the sticky stuff left after burning, has high levels of harmful substances, and it's concentrated at the end of a joint. When scientists looked at lung tissue of some people who smoked weed regularly, they found changes that are known to signal the future growth of cancer."
338,What are the two types of mastectomy?,"There are two kinds: A lumpectomy removes the tumor and a small cancer-free area of tissue surrounding the tumor. A quadrantectomy removes the tumor and more of the breast tissue than a lumpectomy. In some cases, more surgery is required after a partial mastectomy. Sometimes, if cancer cells are still in breast tissue, it may be necessary to remove the entire breast."
338,What does the right type of mastectomy depend on?,"The type of mastectomy that's right for you depends on several things, including: Your age General health Menopause status Tumor size Tumor stage (how far it's spread) Tumor grade (its aggressiveness) Tumor's hormone receptor status Whether or not lymph nodes are involved With this procedure, also called simple mastectomy, your doctor removes your entire breast, including the nipple."
338,What is a total mastectomy?,"The type of mastectomy that's right for you depends on several things, including: Your age General health Menopause status Tumor size Tumor stage (how far it's spread) Tumor grade (its aggressiveness) Tumor's hormone receptor status Whether or not lymph nodes are involved With this procedure, also called simple mastectomy, your doctor removes your entire breast, including the nipple. Your lymph nodes, the small glands that are part of your immune system, may sometimes be removed from your underarm. You're most likely to have a total mastectomy if the cancer has not spread beyond the breast or if you're having a preventative mastectomy to lower your risk of getting breast cancer."
338,What is a preventative mastectomy?,"Women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a preventive mastectomy, also called prophylactic mastectomy. In some cases, women have both breasts removed. This is called a double mastectomy. Some women who've had breast cancer in one breast will decide to have a preventive mastectomy to remove the other breast. A radical mastectomy is the complete removal of the breast, including the nipple."
338,What is a radical mastectomy?,"In the past, a radical mastectomy with complete removal of the breast, lymph nodes in the underarm, and some chest muscles under the breasts, was the standard treatment for breast cancer. The surgeon also removes the overlying skin, the muscles beneath the breast, and the lymph nodes. Because radical mastectomy typically isn't more effective than less extreme forms of mastectomy, it's rarely performed today. It's only recommended when the cancer has spread to the chest muscle."
339,What treats are good for my dog if he has diabetes?,"Avoid snacks that list syrup, molasses, fructose, dextrose, or maltose on the ingredients label. Homemade dehydrated meats, carrots, snap peas, and even canned pumpkin are good options. Balancing insulin and food is like a relay race. The body constantly processes food and insulin between meals and injections."
339,Does regular exercise help dogs with diabetes?,Regular exercise will also help your pooch lose weight and lower blood sugar levels. It’s best to have your dog exercise for the same length of time and at the same intensity every day. An unusually long or vigorous workout could cause blood sugar levels to drop too low.
339,What is the best diet for dogs with diabetes?,"Like humans, when dogs have diabetes, staying trim is key. Most vets recommend a high-fiber, low-fat diet. Fiber slows the entrance of glucose into the bloodstream and helps your dog feel full. Low-fat foods have fewer calories. Together, the diet can help your dog eat less and lose weight."
340,What is heart failure and how is it related to breathing issues?,"Even though âfailureâ is in the name, it doesn't mean that your heart stops beating. It means that it's weak. Shortness of breath and feeling tired can be signs of the condition. Often people also have swelling in their ankles, feet, legs, and mid-section because the heart is not strong enough to pump blood properly.

You'll want to find out as much as you can about your condition so you can learn how to control it and feel better. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on how healthy you are and the symptoms you have. There are several options that may work for you. Braces or splints hold your muscles and joints in the right position and keep them from getting too tight. Onabotulinumtoxin A ( Botox) and abobotulinumtoxin A ( Dysport), used for the treatment of upper and lower limb spasticity, can relax muscles and ease spasms. Your doctor can give you a shot of it directly into your muscles. Botox and Dysport have some potentially serious side effects such as breathing and swallowing issues, so make sure to discuss them with your physician. Drugs like clonazepam ( Klonopin), diazepam ( Valium), and tizanidine ( Zanaflex) also make your muscles more relaxed. Baclofen is a drug that corrects the way your nerves send signals to your muscles. ITB delivers it through a pump to an area of the spinal cord, called the intrathecal space, to prevent spasms. Nerve block injections, shots of drugs that numb the nerves that cause muscles to twitch, may stop spasms when other medicines don't work. Surgery to cut connections between nerves or tendons and muscles that spasm. Your doctor may recommend this if other treatments don't work. Your physical therapist or occupational therapist can help you find ways to increase your flexibility or find new, easier ways to do tasks."
367,What tests are used to diagnose upper limb spasticity?,"She'll give you a physical exam and test your muscle movement to see how well you can control your arms, elbows, wrists, and hands. The electrodes have small needles that go into your muscles, and they're attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electricity in your muscles and nerves. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. She may also inject a drug to briefly numb the area where you have spasms to see if they still happen when you can't move your muscles. The test can take 30 minutes to an hour."
368,What are symptoms of leukemia?,"Many types of leukemia produce no obvious symptoms in the early stages.

You may be in this group if you had or have: Heart attack Valve disease Cardiomyopathy Treatment will depend on your situation."
371,What is stage D heart failure?,"You're in this phase if you never had symptoms of heart failure but you're diagnosed with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which means the left chamber of your heart doesn't pump well."
371,How is stage A heart failure treated?,"When you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other heart and blood vessel conditions like coronary artery disease, you may need to take an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB)."
371,What causes heart failure?,Heart failure can be brought on by many conditions that damage the heart.
371,How can a heart attack cause heart failure?,"Heart attack may happen when a coronary artery is blocked suddenly, which stops the flow of blood to your heart muscle."
372,How do other drugs or foods interact with anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,"Drug or food interactions: Since this spray has little or no effect beyond the area applied, it is unlikely to interact with other drugs."
372,How do anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays work?,"How anticholinergic nasal sprays work: When sprayed into each nostril, anticholinergic nasal sprays decrease secretions from the glands lining the nasal passage."
372,Who should not use anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,Who should not use these medications: Individuals who are allergic to any components of the nasal spray should not take this drug.
372,How should you use anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,Use: The usual dosage is 2 sprays in each nostril 2-3 times per day.
372,What are side effects of anticholinergic nasal allergy sprays?,"Side effects: Anticholinergic nasal sprays may cause an excessively dry nose, thereby causing nosebleeds or irritation."
373,How is a heart transplant used to treat heart failure?,This device is similar to a pacemaker.
373,What should your diet consist of to help with heart failure?,"Limit the salt you eat to less than 1,500 milligrams each day. Eat foods high in fiber and potassium.

But it's up to you to take your medicine, change your diet, live a healthy lifestyle, keep your follow-up appointments, and be an active member of the team."
373,How is heart valve surgery used to treat heart failure?,A surgeon can repair or replace the valves. The doctor puts it into the abdomen or chest and attaches it to your heart to help it pump blood to the rest of your body.
374,Where is the sentinel node located in breast cancer?,"In breast cancer, the sentinel node is usually located in the axillary nodes, under the arm. In a small percentage of cases, the sentinel node is found somewhere else in the lymphatic system of the breast. If the sentinel node is positive, there may be other positive lymph nodes upstream. If it is negative, it is highly likely that all of the upstream nodes are negative."
374,What does a sentinel node biopsy do for breast cancer?,"In breast cancer, a sentinel node biopsy pinpoints the first few lymph nodes into which a tumor drains (called the ""sentinel"" node). This helps doctors remove only those nodes of the lymphatic system most likely to contain cancer cells. The sentinel nodes are the first place that cancer is likely to spread."
374,How is a sentinel node biopsy done?,"To locate the sentinel nodes, a labeling substance, either a radioactive tracer, blue dye, or both, is injected into the area around the tumor before a mastectomy or lumpectomy is performed. The tracer travels the same path to the lymph nodes that the cancer cells would take, making it possible for the surgeon to determine the one or two nodes most likely to test positive for cancer by either visualizing the color or using a handheld Geiger counter."
375,What can I do to curb changes in my breasts during my monthly cycle?,"But it's common to have one or more of the following: Swelling Tenderness Aches Soreness Changes in texture There are a few steps you can take to curb changes in your breasts during your monthly cycle: Eat a diet lower in fat, avoiding high-fat foods.

376,What should you know about the side effects of drugs?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } From the homely aspirin to the most sophisticated prescription medicine on the market, all drugs come with side effects. Many are minor, some are just an inconvenience, a few are serious, and some are just plain strange. Perhaps the most common set of side effects for drugs that work inside your body involves the gastrointestinal system. Nearly any drug can cause nausea or an upset stomach, though it may only happen to a handful of people. For drugs used on the outside, skin irritation is a common complaint."
376,What is the FDA's role in side effects of drugs?,"Before a drug can come on the market, the FDA must approve it. The New Drug Applications ( NDAs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies have, first and foremost, evidence that the drug has the effect it's supposed to have and is safe. This proof comes from testing the drug, first in animals and then in humans. Once the basic questions of safety and efficacy are settled, the FDA will approve the drug if it deems that its benefits outweigh its risks. Still, sometimes testing doesn't reveal everything about a drug's side effects, and they don't show up until after the medication enters the marketplace and more people start using it. That's where Med Watch comes in. The FDA's post-marketing surveillance program seeks voluntary input, mainly from health care professionals, on unwanted effects they see in ''the real world.'' Sometimes these reports are numerous or serious enough for the FDA to take regulatory action, such as adding warnings to a drug's label. This happened with the psoriasis drug Raptiva. The FDA required that the drug carry the agency's strongest warning, known as a black box warning, after it received reports of brain infections and meningitis in patients taking the drug. The drug was later taken off the market. The FDA also wants input from consumers when it comes to side effects. All prescription drugs, and many OTC products, must be labeled with a toll-free number the agency has for letting it know about side effects with drugs, called ""adverse events."" You can report possible new but severe side effects through Med Watch at 1-800- FDA-1088 or through the FDA website."
376,What are surprising results regarding side effects of drugs?,"Not every side effect is a bad one. Some are downright welcome. Take finasteride. Introduced in 1992 to treat noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, it was found to regrow hair. Today, as a lotion or foam, it's a popular OTC remedy for baldness."
376,What are the side effects of drugs based on type?,"To find more about a drug's side effects, look on the label of over-the-counter ( OTC) products or on package inserts or printed materials that you get with prescription drugs. Because the inserts often include a long list of possibilities, you may want to also talk to your pharmacist or doctor about what to expect and watch out for. That can range from itching and rash all the way to a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Some drugs can't help but trigger side effects because of their chemical structure. The common allergy drug diphenhydramine (also known by the brand name Benadryl) is one. Though it eases allergy symptoms, it also blocks the chemical acetylcholine, and that leads to drowsiness and a host of other side effects, including dry mouth. Some drugs have barely noticeable side effects at the right dose. Typically, warfarin ( Coumadin, Jantoven), used to prevent blood clots, usually works well and isn't bothersome, but serious internal bleeding can happen in the wrong situation. Side effects may show up only when a drug is mixed with certain other things. This might be called a drug interaction. For example, drinking alcohol while you're taking narcotic painkillers can cause an accidental overdose. Another example is grapefruit juice, which can affect the blood levels of several drugs, including some blood pressure and cholesterol medicines."
377,How can you manage infections from chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"They can be life-threatening if you're on chemo. Take your temperature any time you feel too warm, too cold, or just not well. If your reading is 100.4 F or higher, call your doctor right away. Wash your hands often to get rid of harmful bacteria. Ask the people around you to do the same."
377,What should I do if I feel nauseous or I throw up after chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer?,Feeling like you're going to throw up or actually doing it can be a problem on treatment days. Your doctor will give you medicine to keep these symptoms at bay.
377,What should I do if I feel shortness of breath after lung cancer surgery?,"You may feel this even though you're getting enough oxygen and you can breathe normally. It's how your brain processes chest pain. It should get better over the next few weeks as you heal. If your lungs are in good shape (other than the cancer) you can usually return to normal life after a while -- even if an entire lung was removed. If you also have a non-cancerous lung disease like emphysema or chronic bronchitis, you may always feel short of breath with some types of activity."
377,What should I do if I have loss of appetite after chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer?,"Instead of three large meals per day, have five or six small ones. Avoid greasy, salty, sweet, or spicy food that might make you feel queasy. If even the smell of food is a turnoff, eat cold meals instead."

Ask the people around you to do the same."
377,How does chemotherapy work against lung cancer?,"These drugs attack cells that divide quickly, which is why they work against cancer cells. But some healthy cells also do this, like those in your hair follicles, bone marrow, and the lining of your mouth and intestines. Chemo attacks them, too, and that leads to certain side effects. They depend on the type and dose of drugs you get and the length of time you take them."
377,What should I do if I have constipation after chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer?,"If you don't go often enough, or if it hurts, you can be more likely to get hemorrhoids or have other problems. Eat more high ­fiber foods like whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. If these lifestyle changes don't help, talk to your doctor."
377,What should I do if I have skin problems after targeted therapy for lung cancer?,"Tell your doctor if you notice any skin changes. If you don't treat them, they can get worse and lead to infections."
377,What is external radiation therapy and how does it treat lung cancer?,"It's a lot like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Before treatments start, the radiation team will take precise measurements to adjust the size and shape of the beam. That makes sure it hits the tumor. The beam destroys cancer cells on impact, but it can also damage healthy cells around them. The procedure itself is painless, but you could have side effects. Some are the same as those with chemo and surgery, and you can treat them the same way."
377,What should I do if I have high blood pressure after targeted therapy for lung cancer?,Your doctor will watch your readings closely if you are getting a drug that can cause this reaction.
377,What should I do if I experience skin changes after external radiation therapy for lung cancer?,These can range from mild redness to blistering and peeling. Clean it each day with warm water and a mild soap that your nurse says is safe to use. Don't use other products on the treatment area unless your doctor or nurse approves them.

377,What are side effects of immunotherapy when it is used to treat lung cancer?,"The most common side effects are flu-like symptoms, fatigue, rashes, fever, and drops in blood pressure. But immunotherapy is very new, so doctors still aren't sure which side effects will happen or how serious they may be."
377,Are there side effects from lung cancer surgery?,"The side effects will vary based on how much of your lung was removed and which type of procedure you had, but here's an idea of what to expect and how to deal with it."
377,What should I do if I have diarrhea after chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer?,"Frequent bowel movements that are loose or watery can get in the way of your daily life. They can also drain too much liquid from your body. Skip dairy and high-fiber, greasy, or spicy foods. Drink water or suck on ice chips, and call you doctor if your symptoms last more than a day."
377,How can you manage diarrhea from chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"Frequent bowel movements that are loose or watery can get in the way of your daily life. They can also drain too much liquid from your body. Skip dairy and high-fiber, greasy, or spicy foods. Drink water or suck on ice chips, and call you doctor if your symptoms last more than a day."
377,What are the side effects of immunotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"The newest approach to lung cancer treatment uses drugs to help your immune system spot and destroy cancer cells better. It shows great promise when traditional treatments fail, especially for people whose cancer is in a later stage. The most common side effects are flu-like symptoms, fatigue, rashes, fever, and drops in blood pressure. But immunotherapy is very new, so doctors still aren't sure which side effects will happen or how serious they may be."
377,How can you manage loss of appetite to manage non-small-cell lung cancer?,"Instead of three large meals per day, have five or six small ones. Avoid greasy, salty, sweet, or spicy food that might make you feel queasy. If even the smell of food is a turnoff, eat cold meals instead."
377,What are other side effects of external radiation therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"Shortness of breath Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Hair loss Loss of appetite Other side effects can include: Skin changes in the area being treated. These can range from mild redness to blistering and peeling. Clean it each day with warm water and a mild soap that your nurse says is safe to use. Don't use other products on the treatment area unless your doctor or nurse approves them. Sore throat. Your windpipe and esophagus, which are in the middle of your chest, may be exposed to radiation. That could cause a sore throat and trouble when you swallow. This can make it hard to eat anything other than soft foods or liquids for a while."
377,What are the side effects of targeted therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"Skin problems. You might have rashes. Tell your doctor if you notice any skin changes. If you don't treat them, they can get worse and lead to infections. High blood pressure. Your doctor will watch your readings closely if you are getting a drug that can cause this reaction. Heart damage. Your doctor will test your heart before treatment and watch your condition closely."
377,How can you get shortness of breath from surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"You may feel this even though you're getting enough oxygen and you can breathe normally.

377,How can you manage bleeding or clotting problems for non-small-cell lung cancer?,"They plug damaged blood vessels and help your blood clot. If you don't have enough of them, you may bleed or bruise more easily than usual, even from a minor injury. Your doctor will check your platelet count often during your treatment. If it falls too low, you may need a transfusion."
377,What should I do if I have hair loss after chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer?,"But some healthy cells also do this, like those in your hair follicles, bone marrow, and the lining of your mouth and intestines. Chemo attacks them, too, and that leads to certain side effects. Follicles, the tiny structures that hair grows out of, contain some of the fastest-growing cells in your body. The good news is that it's almost always temporary. It can make you feel better to cut or shave before it starts to fall out. If you opt to go bald, use an electric shaver so you don't cut your scalp. If you get a wig, shop for it while you still have hair so you can match it to your current hair color."
377,What is targeted therapy and how does it treat lung cancer?,"These drugs attack cells that divide quickly, which is why they work against cancer cells. They can also drain too much liquid from your body."
377,How should I prepare for the side effects of my lung cancer treatment?,Keep in mind that side effects vary even between two people on the same treatment. That's because every person -- and every cancer case -- is unique. The good news is most side effects are temporary and there are ways you can manage them. You'll start to feel better over time -- until the next treatment.
377,What should I do if I feel pain and weakness after lung cancer surgery?,"If this works for you, you'll have less pain and you'll get better faster. If it gets worse, work with your doctor to adjust medications and fine-tune the dosage. Your doctor will give you medicine to keep these symptoms at bay."
377,How can you manage fatigue from chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer?,Pain and weakness. Feeling like you're going to throw up or actually doing it can be a problem on treatment days. You'll start to feel better over time -- until the next treatment. Take short naps during the day to revive yourself. Soak in the tub before bedtime to help you sleep better. Your friends and family may ask how they can help. Let them!
378,How should you take long-term control asthma medications?,Some of these drugs should be taken daily to get your asthma under control and keep it that way. Others are taken on an as needed basis to reduce the severity of an asthma attack.
378,What are quick-relief asthma medications?,"These medications provide fast relief of asthma attack symptoms like cough, chest tightness, and wheezing. They include: Short-acting beta-agonists (bronchodilators) Anticholinergics. These are bronchodilators that can be paired with, or used instead of, short-acting beta-agonists. Systemic corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that get symptoms under control."
378,Can allergy shots treat my asthma?,"Children who get allergy shots are less likely to get asthma, recent studies show, but there are asthma shots specifically for adolescents and adults. Since allergies are an asthma trigger, it makes sense that if you control them, you'll have fewer asthma attacks."
378,How often will you have to take asthma medications?,"How often you need to take your medications depends on how severe your condition is and how frequently you have symptoms. For example, if you only have trouble when you exercise, you may only need to use an inhaler before a workout. But most people with asthma need daily treatment."
378,Are there over-the-counter asthma medications?,"You should talk to a doctor about your asthma symptoms and follow his treatment guidelines. OTC medications are not long-term treatments and shouldn't be relied upon daily to control your asthma. People with high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disease, or heart disease should avoid them. Your medications are the foundation of good asthma control."
379,How can cryosurgery help with treating early-stage prostate cancer?,"This treatment uses very cold gas to freeze and kill cancer cells. Side effects include blood in your urine, bladder and bowel problems, and trouble getting an erection."
379,What is perineal prostatectomy for early-stage prostate cancer?,"The surgeon removes the prostate through a cut between your anus and testicles. Doctors can also do prostatectomy through very small cuts in your pelvis using tiny tools. This technique is called laparoscopy, and the cuts are smaller than in the other operations. A surgeon can also use robotic arms to control the surgical tools and make more precise cuts, called robotic surgery."
379,What are side-effects of surgery for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer?,"Your surgeon will try not to damage nerves and other structures around your prostate during surgery, but sometimes, it's not possible. If your cancer has spread to those nerves, doctors will have to remove them. If that happens, you might have side effects afterward, including: A leaky bladder or trouble controlling your urine Trouble getting or keeping an erection or having orgasms Loss of your ability to get a woman pregnant Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells."
379,What are side-effects of radiation for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer?,"Your doctor will do everything possible to keep from harming the area around your prostate, but some men have side effects from radiation, such as: Diarrhea, blood in their stool, and other bowel problems Trouble controlling urination, or a leaky bladder Erection problems Feeling tired Radiation and surgery are the main treatments for early-stage prostate cancer."
379,How is radiation therapy done for prostate cancer?,"If that happens, you might have side effects afterward, including: A leaky bladder or trouble controlling your urine Trouble getting or keeping an erection or having orgasms Loss of your ability to get a woman pregnant Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. You can get it in one of two ways: External beam radiation therapy focuses X-rays on your prostate from a machine outside your body. Proton therapy better targets prostate tissue in hopes of causing less damage to other parts, but it's not available at many medical centers. Brachytherapy uses small pellets, about the size of rice grains, which slowly give off low levels of radiation inside your prostate for a few weeks or months. Doctors will give you medicine to put you to sleep or make your body numb, then put the pellets in through thin needles. You may have to stay away from pregnant women and children during this treatment. Doctors can also give the radiation through small tubes that they place in your prostate for a few minutes at a time."
379,What is retropubic prostatectomy for early-stage prostate cancer?,"When you're diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early stage, usually stage I or II, it means the disease hasn't spread outside your prostate gland. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and side effects of each type. A surgeon removes the prostate through a cut on your lower belly."
379,When is surgery needed to treat early-stage prostate cancer?,"When you're diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early stage, usually stage I or II, it means the disease hasn't spread outside your prostate gland. Because the cancer hasn't spread beyond your prostate in stage I or II, surgery to remove the gland can sometimes cure the disease. The main operation doctors do is called a radical prostatectomy. The surgeon will remove the whole organ, plus some of the tissue around it."
379,What are the types of treatment for early-stage prostate cancer?,"Doctors usually recommend three main types of treatment for prostate cancer in its early stages: Watchful waiting or active surveillance Surgery Radiation therapy Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. Because the cancer hasn't spread beyond your prostate in stage I or II, surgery to remove the gland can sometimes cure the disease. You may have to stay away from pregnant women and children during this treatment."
380,How is transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) used to treat bleeding varices?,A radiological procedure in which a stent (a tubular device) is placed in the middle of the liver. The stent connects the hepatic vein with the portal vein. This procedure is done by placing a catheter through a vein in the neck. It is done to relieve the high blood pressure that has built up in the portal vein and the liver.
380,How do you treat severe cases of bleeding varices?,"This increased pressure in the portal vein causes blood to be pushed away from the liver to smaller blood vessels, which are not able to handle the increased amount of blood."
380,How serious is bleeding from varices?,"Symptoms include: Vomiting of blood Black, tarry, or bloody stool Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Lightheadedness Shock (in severe cases) Bleeding from varices is a medical emergency. If the bleeding is not controlled quickly, a person may go into shock or die. Even after the bleeding has been stopped, there can be serious complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, confusion, and coma."
380,What are varices?,"They cause no symptoms unless they rupture and bleed, which can be life-threatening. Someone with symptoms of bleeding varices should seek treatment immediately. Doctors can stop the bleeding and help prevent varices from coming back. Portal hypertension is an increase in the pressure within the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver)."
381,What are the symptoms of peripheral vertigo caused by an inner ear infection?,"There are some other conditions of the inner ear that also lead to peripheral vertigo, including: Labyrinthitis Perilymph fistula Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome ( SSCDS) Labyrinthitis may be caused by a viral infection of your inner ear."

381,What conditions of the inner ear cause peripheral vertigo?,"There are some other conditions of the inner ear that also lead to peripheral vertigo, including: Labyrinthitis Perilymph fistula Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome ( SSCDS) Labyrinthitis may be caused by a viral infection of your inner ear. Perilymph fistula may be due to a head injury or sudden pressure change, such as from scuba diving. SSCDS may be due to a breakdown of part of a bony part of a canal that carries fluids in your inner ear."
381,When is surgery used to treat peripheral vertigo?,"For some conditions, such as perilymph fistula or SSCDS, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct problems in your inner ear."
381,How is central vertigo treated?,"Finding out which one you've got -- and what's causing it -- can help you and your doctor decide how to manage it. For some ongoing conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and some tumors, treatment may consist of managing the symptoms. This may include medicines for nausea and drugs that help lessen the sensation of movement."
381,How is peripheral vertigo caused by chronic conditions treated?,"Your doctor may also prescribe medicines that help reduce balance problems. Finding out the root cause of the vertigo and treating it is the only way to manage central vertigo. For some ongoing conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and some tumors, treatment may consist of managing the symptoms. This may include medicines for nausea and drugs that help lessen the sensation of movement."
381,What causes peripheral vertigo?,"The most common causes of the inner ear trouble that leads to peripheral vertigo are: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV) Vestibular neuronitis Meniere's disease BPPV is a condition that causes small crystals to get loose and start to float in the fluid of your inner ear. If your peripheral vertigo is caused by an inner ear infection or a disease, you may have some pain or a feeling of fullness in your ear."
381,What are other symptoms of peripheral vertigo?,This movement may go away when you try to focus your vision on a fixed point. It also tends to only happen during the first few days of vertigo symptoms and then disappears. Your doctor may also prescribe medicines that help reduce balance problems.
382,When should I see a doctor if I've injured my finger?,"When to See a Doctor Inability to move the finger Numbness Bone is exposed The wound is deep or long. Pain and swelling are severe or persistent. You can't clean the wound or the wound is very dirty.

If the wound doesn't heal or shows signs of infection: redness, swelling, pain, or pus."
382,When should I do if I injure my finger and it's bleeding?,"Blood is spurting from the wound Bleeding cannot be stopped after 5-10 minutes of firm and steady pressure 1. Stop Bleeding Apply firm pressure until bleeding stops. If finger or part of finger is severed, put the severed part in a clean plastic bag, pack the bag in ice, and take it with you to the doctor. Clean Wound Wash with fresh water. Apply a sterile bandage. Control Swelling Apply ice to a bruised or swollen finger."
383,What causes Tourette's syndrome?,"Tourette's has been linked to different parts of the brain, including an area called the basal ganglia, which helps control body movements. Differences there may affect nerve cells and the chemicals that carry messages between them. Researchers think the trouble in this brain network may play a role in Tourette's. Doctors don't know exactly what causes these problems in the brain, but genes probably play a role. It's likely that there is more than one cause. People who have family members with Tourette's are more likely to get it themselves."
383,How is Tourette's syndrome treated?,"Many times, tics are mild and don't need to be treated. If they become a problem, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help them. It can take a while to find the right dose that helps control tics but avoids side effects, so be patient as you and your doctor work through it. Medications can include: Haloperidol ( Haldol), fluphenazine ( Prolixin), and pimozide ( Orap), which work on a brain chemical called dopamine to control tics. Clonidine ( Catapres) and guanfacine ( Tenex, Intuniv)), high blood pressure drugs that can also treat tics. Fluoxetine ( Prozac), paroxetine ( Paxil), sertraline ( Zoloft), and other antidepressants, which can relieve anxiety, sadness, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms."
383,How can I take care of my child with Tourette's syndrome?,"If your child has Tourette's, talk to his school about it. You can give staff the facts about the condition and see what kind of support they can give him, like extra tutoring or smaller classes. Fitting in socially also can be hard for a child with the disease. Help him practice ways to handle teasing or comments from other kids."
383,How is Tourette's syndrome diagnosed?,"Tourette's can also cause problems with: Anxiety Learning disabilities such as dyslexia Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) -- thoughts and behaviors you can't control, like washing your hands over and over again If you or your child has symptoms of Tourette's, your doctor may want you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the nervous system. There aren't any tests for the condition, but he'll ask you questions, like: What did you notice that brought you here today? Do you often move your body in a way you can't control? How long has that been happening? Do you ever say things or make sounds without meaning to? When did it start? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? Do you feel anxious or have trouble focusing? Does anyone else in your family have these kinds of symptoms?"
383,Where can I get support with living with Tourette's syndrome?,People who have family members with Tourette's are more likely to get it themselves.
383,What are problems associated with Tourette's syndrome?,"Doctors aren't sure why, but about half of people with Tourette's also have symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). You may have trouble paying attention, sitting still, and finishing tasks. Tourette's can also cause problems with: Anxiety Learning disabilities such as dyslexia Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) -- thoughts and behaviors you can't control, like washing your hands over and over again If you or your child has symptoms of Tourette's, your doctor may want you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the nervous system."
383,What are some questions I should ask my doctor about Tourette's syndrome?,"For some people, they go away completely. How long has that been happening? Do I need any more tests? What kind of specialists do I need to see? Do I need any treatment? Do the treatments have any side effects? If I have children, what are the chances they will have Tourette's? If your child has Tourette's, you may also want to ask how long his tics might last or what you can do to help him deal with his symptoms at home and at school."
384,How can phytonutrients help your body?,"Other plant-based foods also contain phytonutrients, such as: Whole grains Nuts Beans Tea Phytonutrients aren't essential for keeping you alive, unlike the vitamins and minerals that plant foods contain.

Other plant-based foods also contain phytonutrients, such as: Whole grains Nuts Beans Tea Phytonutrients aren't essential for keeping you alive, unlike the vitamins and minerals that plant foods contain."
385,How is peyronie's disease diagnosed?,"Doctors typically diagnose Peyronie's disease by asking about symptoms and any injuries, and by examining the penis. Some doctors inject drugs into the penis to cause an erection so they can see the angle. If you bring in a photo of your erection, you can probably skip this. Your doctor may also order an ultrasound test of the area. There are ways to treat Peyronie's. If you see a family doctor or internist for the problem, he or she may refer you to a urologist for treatment."
385,What are symptoms of Peyronie's disease?,"That's where tissue in the hand becomes scarred and thickened. That can cause problems with erections, but no curving. In addition to a curve, other symptoms may include a lack of firmness, which may make it hard to keep an erection. Even before you notice a curve, you may have painful erections. The pain comes from inflammation caused by the injury and can lasts for many months. The pain usually eases once the injury heals and the scar tissue hardens."
386,What tests are done to diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"He might give you blood or urine tests, X-rays or use other instruments to look for stomach, intestine or kidney problems. You might be sent to a gastroenterologist, a doctor who treats problems with the digestive system."
386,What are symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"The main issue is intense nausea, which may come with strong stomach pains. It often sets in early in the morning and can last for several days. A typical bout may unfold like this: You might start to feel thirsty and sweaty and look pale."
386,How common is cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"Doctors don't see it much. Cyclic vomiting syndrome happens more in children than adults. Only about 1.9% of children get it, one study found. The numbers for adults are less clear, though it may be more often than once thought. Even though it's rare, call your doctor if you are having symptoms."
386,What causes cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"It's slightly more common in girls than boys, and is seen more in whites than in African- Americans or Latinos. Doctors don't see it much. Children who have the syndrome sometimes grow out of it, but many of them get migraines as adults."
386,What are complications of cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"Dehydration is the biggest complication. If a bout is bad enough, you might have to go to a hospital to replace the fluids and electrolytes you lost through vomiting. Other complications might include: Esophagitis, which means the tube that goes from your throat to your stomach gets irritated by the acid you throw up. See a doctor right away if you see blood in your vomit or your stools when you go to the bathroom."
386,What are treatments for cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"Your doctor might recommend medication you can take to keep it from getting worse. Anti-nausea drugs might keep you from vomiting. You may take antacids to cut the amount of acid in your stomach or take other medicines to stop a migraine or lower your anxiety. And you'll probably be told to stay in bed in a quiet, dark room. You might also need other drugs to ease your symptoms."
387,What is a low-pressure headache?,"Two types of headaches are caused by a change of pressure inside your skull: Low-pressure headaches (your doctor may call them spontaneous intracranial hypotension, or SIH) and high-pressure headaches (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or IIH). A low-pressure headache often gets worse when you stand or sit. It can get better if you lie down. It can start at the back of the head, sometimes with neck pain, though it can be felt all over your head. It often gets worse with coughing, sneezing, and exertion. It can come with: Ringing in your ears Muffled hearing Dizziness Nausea You might feel a stabbing pain, throbbing, or just overall pressure in your head."
387,What should you do if you get regular headaches?,"For some, though, headaches are an inconvenient -- sometimes debilitating -- part of their lives. If you get regular headaches, it's important to work with your doctor to uncover the cause and find out how to treat it. That's not always easy because headaches can be caused by many things, from eating ice cream too quickly, to stroke, to many other serious conditions. Two types of headaches are caused by a change of pressure inside your skull: Low-pressure headaches (your doctor may call them spontaneous intracranial hypotension, or SIH) and high-pressure headaches (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or IIH). A low-pressure headache often gets worse when you stand or sit."
387,What are symptoms of high-pressure headaches?,"The symptoms of a high-pressure headache often mimic those of a brain tumor, which is why IIH used to be called âpseudotumor cerebri,â or âfalse brain tumor.â Those symptoms include: Migraine-like or throbbing pain that's often worse in the morning Neck and shoulder pain Headaches that get worse with coughing, sneezing, or exertion Severe headaches that last for a long time Changes in vision or a ringing in the ears IIH is rare."
387,How are low-pressure headaches treated?,"Treatment: Your symptoms may go away by themselves. Sometimes, rest, drinking lots of water, and caffeine may help. A common treatment is something called an epidural blood patch, which tries to stop your CSF leak. Blood is taken from your arm and injected into an area of your spinal canal to âpatchâ the leak. This may not work the first time -- the actual spot where the CSF leaks is hard to find -- so you may have to go through the procedure several times. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called theophylline."
387,How are high-pressure headaches treated?,"Treatment: The best way to ease the effects of IIH is to lose weight. That lowers the pressure on your brain and your optic nerve. You may need weight loss surgery if you're severely obese. In some cases, a medication called acetazolamide is used to cut back on your body's production of CSF. In severe cases, you may need surgery to ease the pressure on your brain. Eye surgery is another possibility."
388,What does heat rash look like?,"It looks like tiny bumps surrounded by red skin. It usually happens on clothed parts of the body, such as your back, abdomen, neck, upper chest, groin, or armpits. And it usually gets better once your skin cools off."
388,What is heat rash?,"Heat rash, also called prickly heat or miliaria, is a common condition in which areas of the skin feel prickly or sting due to overheating. It can itch a lot, but it's not dangerous."
389,How does inotropic therapy help treat heart failure?,Inotropic therapy: This helps make an injured or weakened heart pump harder to send blood through the body. It helps strengthen the heart muscle's contractions. It also relaxes constricted blood vessels so blood can flow more smoothly. Inotropic therapy may also speed up your heart's rhythm. You may get this if you have end-stage heart failure to help relieve and control your symptoms. These medicines are used only when others have stopped working on symptoms.
389,How do ARBs help treat heart failure?,Angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs): These are used to lower blood pressure for people with heart failure. They help keep your blood vessels as wide as possible so blood can flow through your body more easily. They also lessen salt and fluid buildup in your body.
389,How do diuretics help in treating high blood pressure and heart failure?,"Diuretics: You may know these as water pills. They help your kidneys get rid of unneeded water and salt from your tissues and bloodstream. That makes it easier for your heart to pump. They treat high blood pressure and ease swelling and water buildup caused by some medical problems, including heart failure. They also help make breathing easier."
389,What does digoxin do for your heart?,"Digoxin: It helps an injured or weakened heart to send blood through the body and work more efficiently. It strengthens the force of the heart muscle's contractions. It may improve blood circulation. You may be prescribed this if you have an irregular heartbeat (your doctor may call this atrial fibrillation, or AFib). It may help slow down your heart rate."
389,What do calcium channel blockers do?,Calcium channel blockers: These treat chest pain (your doctor may say âanginaâ) and high blood pressure. They relax blood vessels and increase blood and oxygen to your heart. That eases its workload. They treat heart failure caused by hypertension. But they're used only when other medicines to lower blood pressure don't work.
389,What are PCSK9 inhibitors?,Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 ( PCSK9) inhibitors: You may get this new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs if diet and statin treatments aren't helping. They block a liver protein called PCSK9. That protein hinders your liver's ability to get rid of LDL (bad) cholesterol.
389,How do aldosterone inhibitors help in treating heart failure?,They protect your heart by blocking a chemical in your body called aldosterone that causes salt and fluid buildup. This medicine is for folks with some types of severe heart failure.
389,How does warfarin help prevent blood clots?,"You'll get these if you can't take ACE inhibitors. This medicine won't dissolve a blood clot. Over time, the clot may dissolve on its own. Warfarin may also prevent others from forming."
390,How can I make my teen or tween with ADHD self-reliant for getting things done on time?,"Your child shouldn't just rely on you to keep him on schedule. Have him set an alarm clock to get himself up in the morning. To keep aware of time, you may want to get him a watch."
390,How can time management skills help teens and tweens with ADHD?,"And trying to enforce these tasks may often lead to arguments and frustration. By teaching time management, you can make these daily responsibilities more manageable and lessen the stress for everyone. These life skills will also allow your child to become more independent. He'll gain confidence in knowing he can take care of himself. Routines give the day structure, which is helpful for kids with ADHD. An unplanned day can seem overwhelming to a child with ADHD."
390,Where should I keep the list of daily activities for my teen or tween with ADHD?,Put the list where you both can see it. Have your child cross off each item when finished. Kids get a sense of accomplishment from knowing they've completed tasks.
390,How can I help my teen or tween handle big activities?,"Sit down with your child and make a list of all of his daily responsibilities. Together, break down big activities into smaller steps, and decide how long he needs for each task. Don't make the schedule just about tasks. Schedule breaks and other activities your child wants to do."
390,How will organization help my teen or tween with ADHD with time management skills?,"Clear the clutter off your teen's workspace so there's room to organize homework and space to study. It's hard for kids to get anything done when their desk is covered in a messy pile of papers. Have organizers and storage bins handy to keep papers, pencils, and other desk accessories in their proper places. Once you show your child how to organize things, tell him you expect him to keep it organized. Schedule time to put things away."
390,How long should it take to teach time management skills to a teen or tween with ADHD?,You will have good days and bad days. Your child's time management skills won't improve overnight.
390,Why are routines important for teens and tweens with ADHD?,An unplanned day can seem overwhelming to a child with ADHD. There are ways to make things more manageable for you and your teen or tween. It's common for kids with ADHD to put off doing things.
391,What problems could develop with a dental crown?,"Your newly crowned tooth may be sensitive immediately after the procedure as the anesthesia begins to wear off. If the tooth that has been crowned still has a nerve in it, you may experience some heat and cold sensitivity. Your dentist may recommend that you brush teeth with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. Pain or sensitivity that occurs when you bite down usually means that the crown is too high on the tooth. If this is the case, call your dentist. He or she can easily fix the problem."
391,What happens during the second visit for a dental crown?,"Second visit: Receiving the permanent dental crown At the second visit, your dentist will remove the temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. If everything is acceptable, a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place."
391,Why is a dental crown needed?,"A dental crown may be needed in the following situations: To protect a weak tooth (for instance, from decay) from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth To restore an already broken tooth or a tooth that has been severely worn down To cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there isn't a lot of tooth left To hold a dental bridge in place To cover misshapened or severely discolored teeth To cover a dental implant To make a cosmetic modification For children, a crown may be used on primary (baby) teeth in order to: Save a tooth that has been so damaged by decay that it can't support a filling."
391,What metals are used for dental crowns?,"Metals used in crowns include alloys that have a high content of gold or platinum, or base-metal alloys (for example, cobalt- chromium and nickel-chromium alloys). Metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. Also, metal crowns rarely chip or break. The metallic color -- and the high price of gold -- is the main drawback. Metal crowns are a good choice for out-of-sight molars."
391,What happens after reshaping a tooth for a dental crown?,"After reshaping the tooth, your dentist typically will use a paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. Sometimes, though, impressions are made with a digital scanner. Impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. The impressions or scans are sent to a dental lab where the crown will be manufactured. The crown is usually returned to your dentist's office in two to three weeks. If the crown is made of porcelain, your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. During this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. Temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement."
391,How are stainless steel dental crowns used?,"Stainless steel crowns are prefabricated crowns that are used on permanent teeth primarily as a temporary measure. The crown protects the tooth or filling while a permanent crown is made from another material. For children, a stainless steel crown is commonly used to fit over a primary tooth that's been prepared to fit it. The crown covers the entire tooth and protects it from further decay. When the primary tooth comes out to make room for the permanent tooth, the crown comes out naturally with it. In general, stainless steel crowns are used for children's teeth because they don't require multiple dental visits to put in place and so are more cost- effective than custom-made crowns and prophylactic dental care needed to protect a tooth without a crown."
391,How can you get a loose dental crown?,"Sometimes the cement washes out from under the crown. Not only does this allow the crown to become loose, it allows bacteria to leak in and cause decay to the tooth that remains. If a crown feels loose, contact your dentist's office."
391,How are porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns used?,"Porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns can be color matched to your adjacent teeth (unlike the metallic crowns). However, more wearing to the opposing teeth occurs with this crown type compared with metal or resin crowns. The crown's porcelain portion can also chip or break off. Next to all-ceramic crowns, porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns look most like normal teeth.

395,What is mastitis?,"Mastitis is an infection of the tissue of the breast that occurs most frequently during the time of breastfeeding. It can occur when bacteria, often from the baby's mouth, enter a milk duct through a crack in the nipple. Breast infections most commonly occur one to three months after the delivery of a baby, but they can occur in women who have not recently delivered and in women after menopause. Other causes of infection include chronic mastitis and a rare form of cancer called inflammatory carcinoma."
395,What are symptoms of a breast infection?,"Breast infections may cause pain, redness, and warmth of the breast along with the following symptoms: Tenderness and swelling Body aches Fatigue Breast engorgement Fever and chills Abscess: A breast abscess can be a complication of mastitis.

396,What should you expect in your 1-month-old's communication habits?,"One-month-old babies pretty much have one mode of communication -- crying. Your baby will cry for up to three hours a day (don't panic, the crying will decrease as time passes). Crying is baby's way of saying, '' I'm hungry - feed me!'' '' I have a wet diaper,'' or, '' I'm really tired.'' Eventually, you'll start to translate these cries, and discover the best ways to soothe him (for example by rocking or swaddling your baby). Some babies who cry too much may have colic or a medical problem, so call your doctor if you just can't console your newborn."
396,What should you expect in your 1-month-old's motor skills development?,"You'll notice that your baby was born with several innate reflexes, including sucking. Soon after birth, he will be able to (with a little help from you) latch on to a breast or nipple to feed. If you put your finger inside baby's palm, you'll notice that he'll close his fist around it (and many a proud father has bragged about the strength of his newborn's grip). Babies who are startled will quickly flare both arms and legs out and then pull them in. This is called the Moro reflex. Even at 1 month old, your baby has the instinct for walking. If you put a newborn's feet on a solid surface while supporting their body, they'll appear to take a few steps. Although 1-month-olds may be able to turn their head while lying on their stomach, they don't yet have the neck strength to support their head while upright. Make sure to put a hand under your baby's head whenever you lift him."
396,What are some tips for your baby's first month?,"Babies love to be touched. Give your 1-month-old lots of skin-to-skin contact, for example by holding and rocking, or giving him a gentle massage. It will make your newborn feel comforted and loved. Move baby's legs in a bicycling motion for a couple of minutes at a time. This easy exercise will help tone the muscles to prepare for crawling and walking -- which your baby will start doing before you know it!"
396,What should you expect in your 1-month-old's sleeping habits?,"In fact, newborns sleep 15 to 16 hours a day. Those hours may be erratic, because baby hasn't yet adjusted to the normal day and night cycle. You can help your baby adjust by limiting activities to daytime, and keeping things quiet, dark, and boring at night. Eventually he will get the hint that day is for play and night is for sleep. Also, your 1-month-old's sleep cycles are much different than yours. Unlike adults, newborn babies spend more time in REM sleep than in deeper non- REM sleep. That means they may wake up fairly easily during those first few weeks."
396,What should you expect in your 1-month-old's development of the senses?,"Newborns are very nearsighted. Your baby can see objects and people most clearly when they are just 8 to 12 inches away. That means he can see your face while he is nursing, and in fact, will prefer looking at you than at a stuffed animal, because infants are naturally drawn to human faces. They also prefer high-contrast objects because they're easier to see (although you needn't outfit your entire nursery in black-and-white; bright colors are good, too). You may notice that your 1-month-old's eyes cross when trying to focus. That is normal, because a newborn's eye control hasn't fully developed. However, if they remain crossed at three or four months, call your pediatrician, because it could be a sign of strabismus (crossed eyes). Although a newborn's hearing isn't yet fully developed, babies can recognize sounds -- especially their parents' voices, which they got used to hearing in the womb. They especially like high-pitched sounds; so don't get too annoyed when your mother-in-law uses that squeaky baby voice every time she talks to your newborn. If baby doesn't seem to be responding at all to sound, be sure to mention this to your pediatrician at your well visits. Many states screen all babies' hearing at birth, but be sure to mention hearing concerns to your pediatrician even if the birth test was OK. Like many older children (and adults), babies prefer sweet tastes. Their taste buds aren't yet mature enough to distinguish bitter and sour. They have a well-developed sense of smell, and can already pick out the scent of their mother's nipple, and breast milk, within the first few days of life."
396,What should you expect in your 1-month-old's growth development?,"Don't be alarmed if your baby loses some weight during the first few days of life. Babies are born with extra body fluid and typically lose up to 10% of their birth weight before they stabilize and start gaining. By their two-week birthday, babies should be back up to their birth weight, and during the first month they'll gain weight quickly -- putting on between a half-ounce and an ounce a day. Your doctor will check baby's weight gain against a growth chart during your well-baby visits, to make sure he is growing at the right rate."
397,When should you call 911 about hives?,"If you have hives along with fever, nausea, stomach cramps, shortness of breath, and a drop in blood pressure after a bee sting, insect bite, or drug injection, that can be a sign of a life-threatening allergy."
397,How can you treat hives?,"Your doctor may call them urticaria. They can last a few minutes or several days before they go away. If your doctor has prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector for you, make sure you have two with you at all times."
398,What is the best way to prevent colds?,It's all due to the way colds spread.
398,How are colds passed?,"The main way colds get passed around is when someone who's sick coughs or sneezes. Little droplets with germs land on places like doorknobs, telephones, and computer keyboards. Or the sick person coughs or sneezes into their hands and then touches those objects. Then you come along, happy and healthy, and touch that spot. Next, without even realizing it, you might touch your nose and mouth. Voila! In an instant you're infected."
398,How should I wash my hands for cold prevention?,"Here's the drill: First, wet your hands with water. Then add soap. Rub them together vigorously for 20 seconds. Make sure to rub the wrists, between the fingers, and under the fingernails. When you have time, use a nailbrush, as germs often hide under nails. Rinse your hands thoroughly and dry with a clean paper towel or air dryer. If you are in a public restroom, shut the faucet off with a paper towel. Try to push the door open with your shoulder, or use another paper towel to turn the knob."
398,Does hand sanitizer prevent colds?,"It should be at least 60% alcohol. Rub the entire surface of your hands, fingers, and wrist with the sanitizer until dry. You can use this throughout the day if you're not near a bathroom. Follow up with a thorough hand scrub when you're near a sink to prevent buildup of the sanitizer."
398,Why does hand washing prevent colds?,"Some viruses -- tiny living things that cause colds -- can live on surfaces for hours. Regular hand washing is your best strategy to keep them from getting inside your body. And of course, if you're the one who's sick, washing up will keep you from spreading your germs. There's some evidence behind this. A program called Operation Stop Cough was started at a military recruit training command center in Illinois. As part of the program, recruits were told to wash their hands at least five times a day. After 2 years, the hand-washing team reported 45% fewer cases of respiratory illness, compared with sickness rates among recruits during the year before the program started."
398,How much do I need to wash my hands to prevent colds?,"For example, do it before and after you eat, after using the bathroom, after school, and after handling any raw meat, unwashed vegetables, or garbage. Also wash your hands after coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, or touching your pet. If you're babysitting, wash before and after changing a baby's diapers and before and after feedings. You can use this throughout the day if you're not near a bathroom."
399,What causes angina?,"Angina is usually due to heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. That causes pain."
399,What is angioplasty and stenting for angina?,"This could be: Angioplasty /stenting: The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, he inflates the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. A small tube called a stent may be left inside the artery to help keep it open. The stent is usually permanent and made of metal. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You'll probably stay overnight at the hospital."
399,What do medicines for angina do?,"Your doctor might prescribe medicines to: Widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to the heart Slow the heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard Relax blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart Prevent blood clots If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery."
399,What is Prinzmetal's angina?,"It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated."
399,What is unstable angina?,"You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse."

409,What can plaque in your arteries do to your body?,"The cholesterol and cells build up in the artery wall, eventually forming the plaque of atherosclerosis. Plaque is dangerous. Although it often grows without symptoms for years, plaque can suddenly rupture, forming a blood clot that blocks the artery, which keeps oxygen from getting to the heart muscle or the brain. The result can be a heart attack or stroke."
409,How is high blood pressure treated?,"For example, in middle-aged and older adults with high blood pressure, lowering systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 10 points leads to: 50% to 60% lower risk of dying from stroke 40% to 50% lower risk of death from a heart attack Exercise and a low-salt diet that is high in fruits and vegetables will reduce blood pressure by a moderate amount. Weight management is also important in maintaining a healthy blood pressure. For most people, though, medication is necessary to adequately control high blood pressure. In fact, most people will eventually require two or more drugs for blood pressure. Numerous drugs effectively treat hypertension."
409,What causes atherosclerosis?,"Because high blood pressure increases the risk of atherosclerosis, it raises the chance of developing all the complications of atherosclerosis, such as: Heart attack Stroke Peripheral arterial disease Erectile dysfunction Kidney disease When it comes to causing atherosclerosis, though, high blood pressure rarely acts alone. High blood pressure in isolation increases the risk of atherosclerosis, but it's particularly dangerous when it in combination with: Diabetes Abnormal cholesterol levels Cigarette smoking If you have any of these other risk factors and hypertension, your risk of atherosclerosis begins to rise dramatically."
409,What is the normal blood pressure?,"Normal blood pressure is less than 120 over less than 80. Treatment is recommended for blood pressure above 130 over 80 for most people. Treatment may be considered at lower levels, depending on other medical conditions you may have."
409,What can atherosclerosis lead to?,"Because high blood pressure increases the risk of atherosclerosis, it raises the chance of developing all the complications of atherosclerosis, such as: Heart attack Stroke Peripheral arterial disease Erectile dysfunction Kidney disease When it comes to causing atherosclerosis, though, high blood pressure rarely acts alone."
409,How is high blood pressure linked to atherosclerosis?,"High blood pressure is a major cause of atherosclerosis, the artery-clogging process that leads to heart attacks and strokes. Blood pressure higher than 130/80 is seen in: 69% of people who have their first heart attack 77% of people who have their first stroke 74% of people who have congestive heart failure High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, even if it is severely elevated."
409,What can lowering my blood pressure do for me?,"For example, in middle-aged and older adults with high blood pressure, lowering systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 10 points leads to: 50% to 60% lower risk of dying from stroke 40% to 50% lower risk of death from a heart attack Exercise and a low-salt diet that is high in fruits and vegetables will reduce blood pressure by a moderate amount."

Illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine also are associated with increased risk of heat stroke."
410,How can you keep someone with heat stroke cool while you wait for emergency services to arrive?,"Try these cooling strategies: Fan air over the patient while wetting his or her skin with water from a sponge or garden hose. Apply ice packs to the patient's armpits, groin, neck, and back. Because these areas are rich with blood vessels close to the skin, cooling them may reduce body temperature. Immerse the patient in a shower or tub of cool water. If the person is young and heathy and suffered heat stroke while exercising vigorously -- what's known as exertional heat stroke -- you can use an ice bath to help cool the body."
410,What happens after you have heat stroke?,"After you've recovered from heat stroke, you'll probably be more sensitive to high temperatures during the following week. So it's best to avoid hot weather and heavy exercise until your doctor tells you that it's safe to resume your normal activities."
410,How do you prevent a heat stroke?,"When the heat index is high, it's best to stay in an air-conditioned environment. If you must go outdoors, you can prevent heat stroke by taking these steps: Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and a wide-brimmed hat. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor ( SPF) of 30 or more. Drink extra fluids. The general recommendation is to drink 24 ounces of fluid two hours before exercise, and consider adding another 8 ounces of water or sports drink right before exercise. During exercise, you should consume another 8 ounces of water every 20 minutes, even if you don't feel thirsty. Reschedule or cancel outdoor activity. If possible, shift your time outdoors to the coolest times of the day, either early morning or after sunset."

Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19 and is spread by respiratory secretions from an infected person. By the time the rash appears, children are no longer contagious and may attend school or day care."

This is a good thing when an injury involves a break in your skin. But platelets can also group when injury to a blood vessel comes from the inside, as may happen in an artery affected by atherosclerosis. In this situation, the platelets cause blood clots in an already injured artery. Antiplatelet medications can prevent this from happening. Antiplatelets may be prescribed to folks with a history of: Coronary artery disease Heart attack Angina (chest pain) Stroke and transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs) Peripheral artery disease Antiplatelets are also used: After angioplasty and stent placement After heart bypass or valve replacement surgery Usually once or twice a day."

Most often, it's the bladder that gets infected. It can be painful, but not usually too serious. But if those bacteria travel up the ureters, you can have a much more serious problem: a kidney infection. Doctors sometimes call this âpyelonephritis.â You need to have a kidney infection treated right away. If you don't, it can lead to life-threatening problems."
418,Who can get a kidney infection?,"But just as women get more bladder infections than men, they also get more kidney infections. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's closer to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. That means it's easier for bacteria to get into a woman's urethra, and once they do, it's a shorter trip to the bladder. From there, they can spread to the kidneys. Pregnant women are even more likely to get bladder infections because the baby can put pressure on the woman's ureters and slow the flow of urine."

If your arm veins are too small, you may have to have a needle in your shoulder or groin instead. Your blood comes out through one of the tubes and goes into a machine that separates your plasma from your blood cells. Then your blood cells get mixed with fresh plasma, and the new blood mixture goes back into your body through the other tube. Most treatments last 2 to 4 hours, depending on how big your body is and how much plasma gets swapped out. You may need two or three treatments each week for 2 or more weeks. In rare cases, a blood clot could form in the machine."

Seek medical help for traveler's diarrhea if: Diarrhea is severe, bloody, or does not resolve within a few days Diarrhea is accompanied by fever and chills You are unable to keep fluids down to prevent dehydration In areas with poor sanitation, only the following beverages may be safe to drink: boiled water, hot beverages (such as coffee or tea) made with boiled water, canned or bottled carbonated beverages, beer, and wine. Avoid ice, as it may have been made from contaminated water. It is safer to drink from an unopened can or bottle than from a container that is not known to be clean and dry. Water on the surface of a beverage can or bottle may also be contaminated. Therefore, the area of a can or bottle that will touch the mouth should be wiped clean and dried. Where water may be contaminated, you should not brush your teeth with tap water."
428,How can I use iodine to avoid traveler's diarrhea?,"For disinfection with iodine, use either tincture of iodine or tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, such as Globaline or Potable- Aqua. These disinfectants can be found in sporting goods stores and pharmacies. Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions. If the water is cloudy, strain it through a clean cloth and double the number of disinfectant tablets added. If the water is very cold, either warm it or allow increased time for the disinfectant to work. Adding a pinch of salt or pouring water from one container to another will improve the taste."
428,How is traveler's diarrhea treated in children and infants?,"It is important for an infected person to consult a doctor about treating diarrhea in children and infants, because some of the drugs mentioned above are not recommended for children. The greatest risk for children, especially infants, is dehydration. Again, the best treatment for dehydration is the ORS solution."
428,Where are you most likely to get traveler's diarrhea?,"The risk of infection varies depending on the type of exposure -- from a fairly low risk from eating hot, cooked foods and drinking factory-sealed beverages to a higher risk from eating raw vegetables and fruits and drinking tap water. The most common culprit is a bacteria called E.coli. The typical symptoms of traveler's diarrhea include: Abrupt onset of diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Bloating Urgent need to have a bowel movement Malaise (weakness or discomfort) Explosive and painful gas Cramps Loss of appetite Traveler's diarrhea usually lasts from 3 to 7 days and is rarely life threatening."
428,What precautions should I take with food to avoid traveler's diarrhea?,"Where water may be contaminated, you should not brush your teeth with tap water. Unpasteurized milk and dairy products Raw meat and shellfish Food that has been cooked and is still hot is usually safe. Some fish is not guaranteed to be safe, even when cooked, because of the presence of toxins in its flesh. Tropical reef fish, red snapper, amberjack, grouper, and sea bass can occasionally be toxic at unpredictable times if they are caught on tropical reefs rather than in the open ocean. The barracuda and puffer fish are often toxic and should generally not be eaten. Seafood from the islands of the West Indies and the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans should be avoided, as it is more likely to contain toxins."
429,What are common triggers of migraines?,"Common triggers include: Lighting: Bright, flickering, or fluorescent lights can bring migraines to some people. So can glaring computer screens. Smells: You may get a migraine when faced with strong odors like perfumes, secondhand smoke, or cleaners. Different smells can affect people with migraine. Even a whiff of someone's lunch in the microwave can be a trigger. Noise: For some, loud sounds or too much noise can bring a migraine. Travel: Heading out of town for work can bring the pain. It can happen because you change how you sleep and eat when you're on the road. Stress: Many people have lots of pressure on the job. Migraines are most likely to happen when you're stressed."
429,What can help migraines in the workplace?,A headache diary can help you look for patterns. Keep track of what was happening when your migraines started and what you think set them off. You can work with your boss or human resources department to come up with ways to make it easier to do your job.
430,What are some conditions that can lead to erectile dysfunction?,"Other options your doctor can help you explore include: Injections Suppositories Surgical penile implants Special devices, like vacuum pumps, which boost blood flow to the penis It can be linked to more serious health conditions like: High blood pressure Hardening of the arteries Diabetes It can also be linked to other medical treatments, such as: Prostate surgery Radiation therapy If your doctor can find the cause, treating that may also help you in the bedroom."
430,"If I see a urologist for erectile dysfunction, what will they ask?",The urologist will ask what happens when you have sex. This will help him know where to start. He'll use your answers to track your progress. He'll ask more questions about your health and give you a physical exam. You may have to have more blood work or an ultrasound.
430,What if I'm concerned about talking to my doctor about my erectile dysfunction?,"The best approach is just to say, "" I think I may have ED."" It's unlikely your doctor will feel uncomfortable. If he has trouble talking about sexual issues with you, ask him to refer you to a urologist. The doctor will start by asking about your medical history. He'll do this to learn more about your symptoms, conditions, and what medicines you're taking. The questions may seem personal. But it's important to answer them fully and honestly. The doctor needs this information to know how to treat you."
430,What questions might my doctor ask about my erectile dysfunction?,"The questions may include: Do you ever get an erection? If you do, is it firm enough to have sex? If you do start to have sex, do you then lose the erection? Does it ever come back? Can you get an erection by masturbation? Do you ever wake up with an erection? The doctor will ask if you smoke, how much alcohol you drink, and whether or not you use recreational drugs."
431,What are medical causes of heartburn and acid reflux?,"These factors include: Dietary Habits Eating large portions Eating certain foods, including onions, chocolate, peppermint, high-fat or spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and tomatoes or tomato-based products Drinking certain beverages, including citrus juices, alcohol, and caffeinated and carbonated drinks Eating before bedtime Lifestyle Habits Being overweight Smoking Wearing tight-fitting clothing or belts Lying down or bending over, especially after eating Medical Causes Pregnancy Bulging of the stomach into the chest cavity, also called hiatal hernia GERD Ulcers Certain bacteria Taking certain medications, especially some antibiotics, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aleve or Advil"
431,How many Americans experience heartburn/reflux symptoms at least once each month?,"Most people have felt heartburn at one time or another. In fact, the American Gastroenterological Association reports that more than 60 million Americans experience heartburn/reflux symptoms at least once each month. Though uncomfortable, heartburn does not usually present a serious health problem for most people."
431,What lifestyle habits can cause heartburn?,"These factors include: Dietary Habits Eating large portions Eating certain foods, including onions, chocolate, peppermint, high-fat or spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and tomatoes or tomato-based products Drinking certain beverages, including citrus juices, alcohol, and caffeinated and carbonated drinks Eating before bedtime Lifestyle Habits Being overweight Smoking Wearing tight-fitting clothing or belts Lying down or bending over, especially after eating Medical Causes Pregnancy Bulging of the stomach into the chest cavity, also called hiatal hernia GERD Ulcers Certain bacteria Taking certain medications, especially some antibiotics, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aleve or Advil"
431,What dietary habits can cause heartburn?,"These factors include: Dietary Habits Eating large portions Eating certain foods, including onions, chocolate, peppermint, high-fat or spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and tomatoes or tomato-based products Drinking certain beverages, including citrus juices, alcohol, and caffeinated and carbonated drinks Eating before bedtime Lifestyle Habits Being overweight Smoking Wearing tight-fitting clothing or belts Lying down or bending over, especially after eating Medical Causes Pregnancy Bulging of the stomach into the chest cavity, also called hiatal hernia GERD Ulcers Certain bacteria Taking certain medications, especially some antibiotics, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aleve or Advil"
432,How can I prepare for an electroencephalogram (EEG)?,Let your doctor know about any medications -- both prescription and over-the-counter -- and supplements you're taking. Wash your hair the night before the test. Don't use any leave-in conditioning or styling products afterward.
432,What happens after an electroencephalogram (EEG)?,"The technician will take the electrodes off and wash off the glue that held them in place. You can use a little fingernail polish remover at home to get rid of any leftover stickiness. Unless you're actively having seizures or your doctor says you shouldn't, you can drive home. But if the EEG was done overnight, it's better to have someone else drive you. You can usually start taking medications you'd stopped specifically for the test. A neurologist, a doctor who specializes in the brain, will look at the recording of your brain wave pattern."
432,What is an electroencephalogram (EEG)?,The machine is only recording the activity of the brain and does not stimulate it. It's rare to have a seizure during the test.
432,What happens during an electroencephalogram (EEG)?,"You lie down on the exam table or bed, and a technician puts about 20 small sensors on your scalp. These sensors, called electrodes, pick up electrical activity from cells inside your brain called neurons and send them to a machine, where they show up as a series of lines recorded on moving paper or displayed on a computer screen. You'll relax with your eyes open first, then with them closed. The technician may ask you to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light, because both of these can change your brain wave patterns."
433,How can inflammatory bowel diseases trigger problems elsewhere in the body?,"You know the main symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases. But did you know that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis -- both of which are IBDs -- can trigger problems elsewhere in your body? They can show up before you even know you have an IBD, or not until years after your diagnosis. Many of these issues go away when you get your irritable bowel disease under control. That's because treating the inflammation that goes along with an IBD can help manage it in other parts of your body, too."
433,How else can inflammatory bowel disease affect someone?,"Other potential problems include: Anemia Gallstones and kidney stones Inflamed liver Inflamed or scarred bile ducts, especially if you have ulcerative colitis Delayed growth or puberty in children and teens Your doctor will help you spot these problems. He may refer you to a specialist, like a rheumatologist for your joints, a dermatologist for your skin, or an ophthalmologist for your eyes, depending on how bad your symptoms are."
433,How are bones affected by inflammatory bowel disease?,"There are a couple of reasons people with IBD get osteoporosis. Medications, like steroids, not enough physical activity, and trouble absorbing vitamin D and minerals such as calcium and magnesium all play a role. You're also more likely to break a bone than the people without an irritable bowel disease. This risk goes up as you age. Usually, women are at greater risk for osteoporosis. But IBD-related osteoporosis affects men and women in equal numbers. Calcium and vitamin supplements can help keep your bones healthy, along with exercise, avoiding alcohol, and not smoking."
433,How are joints affected by inflammatory bowel disease?,"Joint pain is the most common non-gut ailment for people with IBD. It can affect your large joints like your ankles, hips, or knees, or small ones like your fingers. Although you might notice symptoms as long as a decade before you're diagnosed, this type of arthritis usually doesn't damage your joints. It should go away once you get your disease under control. Talk to your doctor before you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) for joint pain. They can make your IBD worse."
433,Which areas of the body can extra-intestinal symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease affect?,"These âextra-intestinalâ symptoms, as doctors like to call them, can affect many areas of your body, including your joints, mouth, eyes, skin, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and pancreas. Even osteoporosis has been linked to IBDs. You can have one of these extra symptoms or several. They're more common if your parents or siblings have an irritable bowel disease and have extra-intestinal problems related to IBD."
433,How is skin affected by inflammatory bowel disease?,"It should go away once you get your disease under control. You might hear your doctor call them erythema nodosum. They'll probably show up at the same time as your IBD flares. They, too, will go away -- without leaving scars -- when you get a handle on the disease. Less common but more serious are ulcers that can range from a small spot to the length of your leg. The more serious your IBD symptoms are, the more likely you are to get them. Doctors treat them with high-powered meds that target your immune system. If you have Crohn's disease, you might also get lesions inside your mouth. Antiseptic mouthwash and topical steroids can help."
434,How can I find the cause of memory loss?,"If you find that you are increasingly forgetful or if memory problems interfere with your daily life, schedule an appointment with your doctor to determine the cause and best treatment. To evaluate memory loss, your doctor will take a medical history, perform a physical exam -- including a neurologic exam -- and ask questions to test mental ability. Depending on the results, further evaluation may include blood and urine tests, nerve tests, and imaging tests of the brain such as computerized axial tomography ( CAT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)."
434,How can sleep deprivation lead to memory loss?,"Both quantity and quality of sleep are important to memory. Getting too little sleep or waking frequently in the night can lead to fatigue, which interferes with the ability to consolidate and retrieve information."
434,How is memory loss treated?,"A severe hit to the head -- from a fall or automobile accident, for example -- can injure the brain and cause both short- and long-term memory loss. For example, memory loss from medications may resolve with a change in medication. Nutritional supplements can be useful against memory loss caused by a nutritional deficiency. And treating depression may be helpful for memory when depression is a factor. In some cases -- such as following a stroke -- therapy may help people remember how to do certain tasks such as walking or tying shoes. In others, memory may improve over time. Treatments may also be specific to conditions related to memory loss. For example, drugs are available to treat memory problems related to Alzheimer's disease, and drugs to help lower blood pressure can help reduce risk of more brain damage from dementia related to high blood pressure."
434,"How can alcohol, tobacco, or drug use lead to memory loss?","Alcohol, tobacco, or drug use. Studies have shown that people who smoke find it more difficult to put faces with names than do nonsmokers. Illicit drugs can change chemicals in the brain that can make it hard to recall memories. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is stopped due to the blockage of a blood vessel to the brain or leakage of a vessel into the brain."
434,How can nutritional deficiency lead to memory loss?,Both quantity and quality of sleep are important to memory. Deficiencies in vitamin B1 and B12 specifically can affect memory.
434,How can strokes lead to memory loss?,"Strokes often cause short-term memory loss. A person who has had a stroke may have vivid memories of childhood events but be unable to recall what he or she had for lunch. Although there are many causes of dementia -- including blood vessel disease, drug or alcohol abuse, or other causes of damage to the brain -- the most common and familiar is Alzheimer's disease."
434,How can depression and stress lead to?,"Illicit drugs can change chemicals in the brain that can make it hard to recall memories. Stress and anxiety can also get in the way of concentration. When you are tense and your mind is overstimulated or distracted, your ability to remember can suffer. Stress caused by an emotional trauma can also lead to memory loss."
435,What are side effects of nitrates?,"While you're using nitrates, get your blood pressure checked regularly. Nitrates may make you feel dizzy. You may also get a rapid, irregular, or pounding heartbeat when you take the drugs regularly. It usually gets better after the first few weeks. If it keeps up, talk to your doctor. Some other side effects are: Headache Flushing of your face or neck. Call your doctor if it persists or is severe. Low blood pressure."
435,How should you take nitrates?,"Some nitrates include: Dilatrate- SR, Iso- Bid, Isonate, Isorbid, Isordil, Isotrate, Sorbitrate (isosorbide dinitrate) Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate) Bi Dil (hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate) Follow the label directions on when and how to take them. It's OK to take these drugs with or without meals. Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand how to take these medications during the day. The number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and how long you need to take them depend on your condition."
436,What are the risks of gastric sleeve weight loss surgery?,"Certain foods may not agree with you now. You may also develop nutrition problems after surgery, which is why you have to take vitamins and supplements for life. Your doctor will advise you on exactly what you need."
436,What changes will I need to make to my diet after gastric sleeve surgery?,"After that first month, you'll switch to eating soft solid foods very slowly. Other pointers to keep in mind: Everything must be chewed thoroughly before being swallowed. Don't drink while you eat, as this might cause your new stomach to overfill. Drink liquids a half-hour after finishing a meal. Avoid high-calorie sodas and snacking. Take vitamin and mineral supplements every day."
436,What happens during gastric sleeve weight loss surgery?,"The surgery takes about an hour. Your surgeon will make a few small cuts in your belly and insert a laparoscope -- an instrument with a tiny camera that sends pictures to a monitor. The surgeon will then insert other medical instruments through the additional cuts and remove 3/4 of your stomach. Finally, he'll reattach the rest of your stomach to form the ""sleeve"" or tube. You might be in hospital about 2 or 3 days. The procedure is permanent."
436,How much weight do people lose after gastric sleeve weight loss surgery?,"People generally lose 60% of their extra weight over 12 to 18 months. So if you are 100 pounds overweight, you'll lose about 60 pounds, though some lose more and others less. Of course, exercising and eating right add to your weight loss."
436,When can I go back to regular means after gastric sleeve weight loss surgery?,"You won't be able to eat as much as you used to, which helps you lose weight. Your doctor will advise you on exactly what you need."
437,What can happen if gallstones are left untreated?,"If left untreated, gallstones can also lead to more serious problems, like: Cholecystitis -- an inflamed gallbladder Pancreatitis -- an inflamed pancreas Cholangitis -- inflamed bile ducts Before your doctor opts for surgery, he'll run several tests to see the effect your gallstones are having on your health."
437,What is recovery like after gallbladder surgery?,"The length of time it takes you to heal depends on the type of surgery you have. If you have your gallbladder removed during open surgery, you'll need to stay in the hospital for a few days afterward. It may take between 6 to 8 weeks for your body to heal fully. Laparoscopy is less involved, so you'll have less pain and heal faster than if you have open surgery. Most people who have it are able to go home from the hospital the same day. You'll likely be back to your normal routine within 2 weeks."
437,What tests are done before surgery for gallstones?,"If left untreated, gallstones can also lead to more serious problems, like: Cholecystitis -- an inflamed gallbladder Pancreatitis -- an inflamed pancreas Cholangitis -- inflamed bile ducts Before your doctor opts for surgery, he'll run several tests to see the effect your gallstones are having on your health. Tests might include: Blood test Ultrasound MRI HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan -- a radioactive chemical is put into your body to create images of any blocked ducts Endoscopic ultrasonography -- an imaging device is put into your mouth and down through your digestive tract so sound waves can create a detailed picture of your small intestine You may be able to manage your symptoms for a short time by making changes to your diet."
437,What are the risks of gallbladder surgery?,"Doctors believe gallbladder surgery is safe, but some problems can still arise. These may include: Problems with anesthesia Infection Bleeding Swelling Bile leakage Damage to a bile duct Damage to your intestine, bowel, or blood vessels Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) Heart problems Pneumonia You also run the risk of a problem doctors call âpost-cholecystectomy syndromeâ ( PCS). It can happen if any gallstones are left in your bile ducts or bile happens to leak into your stomach. The symptoms of PCS are similar to those of gallstones. They include belly pain, heartburn, and diarrhea."
437,What should you know about getting surgery for gallstones?,"About 80% of people who have gallstones will need surgery. Doctors can remove your gallbladder in one of two ways: Open surgery: During this procedure, your surgeon will make a 5- to 7-inch incision (cut) on your belly to take out your gallbladder. And even if your gallstones do go away, there's a chance they'll return. It can happen if any gallstones are left in your bile ducts or bile happens to leak into your stomach. The length of time it takes you to heal depends on the type of surgery you have. Most people who have it are able to go home from the hospital the same day."
437,When do you need surgery for gallstones?,"You'll need open surgery if you have a bleeding disorder. You'll only need it if a stone goes into, or blocks, one of your bile ducts. This causes what doctors call a âgallbladder attack.â It's an intense, knife-like pain in your belly that can last several hours."
437,How is laparoscopic cholecystectomy done for gallstones?,"Doctors can remove your gallbladder in one of two ways: Open surgery: During this procedure, your surgeon will make a 5- to 7-inch incision (cut) on your belly to take out your gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Doctors also call this âkeyhole surgery.â Your surgeon doesn't make a big opening in your belly. Instead, he makes four small cuts. Next, he'll insert special tools to remove the diseased organ."
438,How should I clean up my cat’s vomit?,"3 -- Vomit Like humans, cats vomit. Unlike humans, they don't do it in the toilet. Try to clean the mess before it sets to avoid odors and stubborn stains. If the vomit is solid, pick it up with a paper towel. Then scrub the area with a pet-safe deodorizing cleaner. If the vomit is loose, scrape it into one pile with a plastic spoon. Blot the area with paper towels. Then use a deodorizer or pet stain-and-odor remover. You may need to clean stubborn stains or odors more than once."
438,How can I help stop my cat from spraying urine?,"To stop your cat from spraying, try a pheromone product. It smells like your cat's natural scent. One whiff, and he'll have no reason to mark his territory again."
438,How should I clean up my cat’s poop?,"2 -- Poop Cat poop may be smellier than urine, but it's easier to get off your floor. Wear gloves. Cat feces may contain a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that's especially dangerous to pregnant women. If you're pregnant, let your partner clean up the mess. Pick up the poop with paper towels. Throw it out in the same place you toss your litter box scoopings. Rinse the area with cool water and blot dry. Apply an enzyme-based pet stain-and-odor remover."
438,How should I clean up my cat’s urine sprays and stains?,"Don't use any ammonia-based cleaning products. They smell like cat pee, which may entice kitty to re-mark the spot. Soak the area with carpet cleaner or a few drops of dish detergent mixed with water. Let it sit for 1 to 2 hours. Rinse with a wet sponge. The next day, spray the area with an enzymatic cleaner such as A. O. E. ( Animal Odor Eliminator), Elim- Odor Feline, or F. O. N. ( Feline Odor Neutralizer). Keep your cat away until the area dries. Blot the area with paper towels."
438,Why would a cat not use the litter box and make a mess on the floor or carpet?,"1 -- Urine Sprays and Stains Cats don't always aim straight for the litter box. When your cat leaves a ""present"" on the carpet, he could be spraying to mark his territory or objecting to the litter box’s location or cleanliness. Whatever your cat's reason for peeing on the carpet, it's going to stink if you don't clean it up quickly. Cats can sniff out areas they've marked and target them again. If your cat soils your carpets and never did this before, or she constantly soils the carpets, call your vet. It could be a sign of a health problem that needs attention."
439,What are common signs of insomnia with untreated depression?,"Common signs of insomnia include: Daytime fatigue Irritability and difficulty concentrating Sleep that never feels like ""enough"" Trouble falling asleep Trouble going back to sleep after waking up during the night Waking up at all hours of the night Waking up before the alarm clock goes off Alcohol and drug abuse are common among people with clinical depression."
439,How is sleep disrupted by untreated depression?,"Though the most common problem is insomnia (difficulty getting adequate sleep), people sometimes feel an increased need for sleep and experience excessive energy loss. Lack of sleep can cause some of the same symptoms as depression -- extreme tiredness, loss of energy, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. In addition, untreated depression may result in weight gain or loss, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, and irritability. Treating the depression helps the person get control over all of these depression symptoms."
439,What are warning signs of suicide with untreated depression?,"Warning signs of suicide include: Talking, writing, or thinking about killing or hurting oneself or threatening to do so Depression (deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating) that gets worse Having a ""death wish;"" tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death -- for example, driving through red lights Losing interest in things one used to care about Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, or changing a will Saying things like ""it would be better if I wasn't here"" or "" I want out"" A sudden switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy Suddenly visiting or calling people one cares about Talking about suicide Increase in drinking alcohol or using drugs Writing a suicidal note Watching well publicized murder and/or suicide reports in the media Conducting on-line searches on ways to commit suicide Seeking methods to kill oneself, such as getting a gun or pills For in depth information, see Web MD's Depression and Suicide."
439,Why is untreated depression considered to be a disability?,"Depression can render people disabled in their work life, family life, and social life. Left untreated, clinical depression is as costly as heart disease or AIDS to the U. S. economy. Untreated depression is responsible for more than 200 million days lost from work each year. The annual cost of untreated depression is more than $43.7 billion in absenteeism from work, lost productivity, and direct treatment costs."
439,How does untreated depression affect my family?,Living with a depressed person is very difficult and stressful for family members and friends. It's often helpful to have a family member involved in the evaluation and treatment of a depressed relative. Sometimes marital or even family therapy is indicated.
439,Are the signs of untreated depression in men different from those in women?,"Men who have untreated clinical depression may exhibit more anger, frustration, and violent behavior than women. In addition, men with untreated depression may take dangerous risks such as reckless driving and having unsafe sex. Men are not aware that physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain, can be symptoms of depression."
439,What should you know about untreated depression?,"Clinical depression affects the way you eat and sleep. It affects the way you feel about yourself and those around you. It even affects your thoughts. People who are depressed cannot simply âpull themselves togetherâ and be cured. Without proper treatment, including antidepressants and/or psychotherapy, untreated clinical depression can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people with depression. There is mounting evidence that clinical depression takes a serious toll on physical health. Signs of drug and alcohol abuse include: Inability to maintain personal relationships Secretive alcohol use Self-pity Tremors Unexplained memory loss Unwillingness to talk about drugs or alcohol Those who suffer depression and abuse drugs or alcohol may need very specialized treatment. Left untreated, clinical depression is as costly as heart disease or AIDS to the U. S. economy. Untreated depression makes it difficult for employees to work well."
439,Who can be treated successfully for clinical depression?,"Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people with depression. People with untreated depression can usually get to work."
440,What are signs of primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) in children?,"Signs that your child may have a PIDD include: Has four or more infections a year in the ears, lungs, skin, eyes, mouth, or private parts Needs to get antibiotics through an IV for infections Gets more than one severe, fast-moving illness, like septicemia, a bacterial infection of the blood Has thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth) that doesn't go away Antibiotics don't work well Gets pneumonia more than once a year Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Has your child had a lot of severe infections?"
440,How does a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) affect you?,"If your child has it, in most cases he'll be able to go to school and make friends like other kids. As an adult with a PIDD, he'll be able to work and have an active, normal life."
440,When should I notice the symptoms of primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) in children?,"You may not notice any symptoms until your child is a few months old. He may get a lot of serious infections, or his illness may start out as a common cold but turn into bronchitis or pneumonia."
440,How can a stem cell transplant treat primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) in children?,"It's rare, but for a very severe PIDD, your child could need a stem cell transplant. In some cases, it's a cure. Stem cells help make new blood cells. They come from bone marrow, which is the soft center of the bones. For a transplant, a donor supplies stem cells with unbroken genes. Your child will need to find someone who is the right match so that his body accepts the new cells. Close relatives, such as a brother or sister, are the best chance. Someone from the same racial or ethnic background may also be a good donor. If no one you know is a match, you can put your child on a waiting list."
440,How should children with primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) eat and exercise?,"Just like anyone else, your child should eat good foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Make exercise a habit, and see that he gets plenty of sleep, too."
440,What is a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD)?,"When your child has a primary immunodeficiency disease ( PIDD), his body has a harder time fighting germs that make people sick. He may get a lot of infections in his ears, lungs, skin, or other areas that take a long time to go away. Most cases happen in babies or young children, but sometimes it doesn't show up until adulthood. There are many different types -- more than 200 -- and they affect different parts of the immune system. All make it more likely that he'll get sick from infections."
440,What causes primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD)?,"You can't catch PIDDs like you can a cold or the flu. Your child has it because he was born with a broken gene that affects his immune system. Sometimes this problem runs in families. Or it may have happened on its own. Normally, your body's white blood cells fight infections. Some people with PIDDs are missing certain types of white blood cells, or those cells don't work very well. If that's true for your child, he's more likely to get sick from infections that wouldn't take hold in someone else."
440,How does immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy treat primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) in children?,"These are disease-fighting proteins called antibodies that your child needs. Doctors usually give it through a needle, by IV. The antibodies only last so long, so your child may need a treatment every 3 or 4 weeks. He might have some side effects such as achy muscles or joints, headaches, or a low fever."
440,How can a child who has primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) keep from catching diseases?,"To keep germs away, wash hands often, lathering up with soap for at least 20 seconds. Teach him to keep rubbing his soapy hands together while singing the "" Happy Birthday"" song twice, which is long enough to get the job done. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available. Stress can make it harder for his body to fight disease. Encourage him to take time to relax, play, and enjoy hobbies. Massage therapy, exercise, being with people he likes, and prayer or meditation are some other ways to lower his stress."
440,What are questions to ask my doctor about primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD)?,What else could cause these symptoms? How can I keep my child from getting sick? What reactions should I expect from the treatment? Should my child get all the usual vaccines? Does my child need to stay away from some sports?
440,How should I take care of my child with primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD)?,"Even with a PIDD, your child will be able to go to school, make friends, and keep up with activities. You'll want to meet with his teachers to explain his condition and to let them know he may need to miss classes because of illness more often than other kids. You should also let the school know about medications he'll need to take."
440,What happens during a stem cell transplant treat primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) in children?,"During the transplant, your child will get the new stem cells through an IV. He won't feel any pain from this, and he'll be awake while it's happening. It could take 2 to 6 weeks for the new stem cells to multiply and start making healthy, working blood cells. During this time, your child may need to stay in the hospital or, at the very least, make visits every day to get checked by his transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of good blood cells in his body gets up to normal."
440,What can I expect from primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) and its treatments?,"Everyone's experience with a PIDD is different because there are so many types of this disease. Most people, with the right treatment, can live a full and active life. The most severe forms of the disease may be treated, and possibly cured, with stem cell transplants, although that's not an easy process. When your child has this illness, the whole family will need lots of emotional support from people like friends, extended family members, and neighbors. Talk to your doctor about getting in touch with other families who have a child with a severe PIDD and can understand what it's like."
440,Where can I get information about primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) treatments and support groups?,The web site of the Immune Deficiency Foundation can help you find a doctor or get in touch with a support group. The site also has information about clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they're safe and how well they work. Trials are a way for people to try medicines that aren't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if this is a good option for your child.
440,How do doctors treat primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD)?,"If your child's PIDD is mild, he may need to take medicines to treat the infections he gets. The treatment takes several hours, and he'll need one every few weeks. Some severe forms of PIDD may need even more serious treatment: a bone marrow transplant, which has a long recovery time."
440,How can a doctor diagnose a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) in a child?,"Does your child stay sick even after taking antibiotics? Do other people in your family tend to get sick a lot? Other tests will measure certain proteins that fight disease, called immunoglobulins. Many states now test newborns for the most severe kind of PIDD, called SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency). The antibodies only last so long, so your child may need a treatment every 3 or 4 weeks."
441,Should I stay away from people who are sick?,"If possible, stay away from people who have a cold or the flu. If you can't -- because you're caring for a sick family member, for instance -- step up your hand-washing routine and your attention to other defenses against germs."
441,When should I get the flu shot?,"It's especially important if you're in a group that doctors say is at high risk for getting sick: Children Adults older than 50 Women who will be pregnant during flu season Nursing home residents People with asthma or a long-term heart or lung condition People with diabetes or another condition that weakens the immune system -- the body's defense against germs Health care workers For the best protection, get the flu vaccine when it comes out each year in October or November. But even later is better than not at all. It takes 2 weeks for the flu vaccine to take effect, and flu season can last into March or April."
441,What is the best method for hand washing to prevent sickness?,"Do it thoroughly: Use soap and water. Scrub for at least 20 seconds. Wash before you eat or prepare food and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper. If you're taking care of someone who's sick, wash your hands before and after being with them."
441,Do I have to stay home when I'm sick?,"Stay home when you're sick. If you go to school or work when you don't feel well, you can make a lot of people sick. Although a cold or flu might not be a big deal for you, it can be serious for people with weak immune systems, like young children, the elderly, and anyone with a long-term health problem. Working while you're sick isn't good for you, either. It can make it harder for your body to fight off a cold. So do what's best for you and everyone else. Take a couple of days off."
441,Who should get a flu vaccine?,"Anyone over 6 months old should get one. It's especially important if you're in a group that doctors say is at high risk for getting sick: Children Adults older than 50 Women who will be pregnant during flu season Nursing home residents People with asthma or a long-term heart or lung condition People with diabetes or another condition that weakens the immune system -- the body's defense against germs Health care workers For the best protection, get the flu vaccine when it comes out each year in October or November."
441,Should I wash cloths and towels more often if someone in my home is sick?,"Cold and flu germs can cling to fabric. So when someone in your house is sick, replace cloth hand towels and dishrags with paper towels. Remove water glasses and add paper cups in the bathroom, too."
441,Can using hand sanitizer keep me from getting sick?,"It's the next best thing if you can't get to a sink. Keep a small bottle with you -- at work, in your car, and in your purse. Buy one with at least 60% alcohol. Rub it all over your hands until they're dry."
441,How can I disinfect an area if people around are sick?,"If you don't have one with you, don't cough into your hand. Still, if someone in your family is sick, use one to wipe down high-traffic spots: computers, phones, doorknobs, and TV remotes."
441,How can I keep a cold or flu away from my friends?,"Then it's time for action. Cover your nose and mouth . If you don't have one with you, don't cough into your hand. You'll just smear germs on the next thing you touch. Instead, cough into the crook of your elbow."
441,How can I avoid getting sick if people around me are?,"Wash your hands . It's the single best way to avoid a cold. Once germs are on your hands, it's easy for them to get into your body when you touch your eyes or mouth. Take care of yourself."
441,How can I change my lifestyle to avoid getting sick?,"Or are you worried you may give your cold to your family? So make sure you eat nutritious food, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep."
442,Can an oral surgeon help with my impacted teeth?,"Impacted teeth: This mostly happens with wisdom teeth. But it can happen in other places in your mouth, too. When the teeth come through the gums for the first time, it might be crowded, so they either don't come out at all or don't come out completely. This can cause sore gums and infections. Your dentist or surgeon might recommend you get your wisdom teeth pulled, even before they present any problems."
442,How can an oral surgeon help me with a missing tooth?,"Implants: You can replace a missing tooth with a dental implant. The surgeon imbeds a titanium implant into your jaw, then your dentist attaches a crown."
442,What conditions can oral surgeons help treat?,"Cancer treatment: Oral surgeons also treat cancers, not just of the mouth, but also of the head and neck, like of the salivary glands, sinuses, throat, larynx, and lips. Oral surgeons can also help with: Nerve repair Cleft lips and cleft palate surgery Removal of lesions on the face or inside the mouth If you have problems with your teeth or gums, talk with your dentist."
442,Can an oral surgeon help with issues with my jaw joint?,"Jaw-joint issues: The temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) connects your jaw to your skull. It's that little âhingeâ right in front of the ears. It can cause problems like pain in your jaw, jaw-popping, stiffness, and headaches. Oral devices, pain medication, and ice packs can help. But people with recurring problems may need oral surgery."
442,Can an oral surgeon help correct issues with breathing and sleep?,"Sleep and breathing issues: This covers things like snoring and sleep apnea, a condition that causes you to stop breathing for brief periods during sleep. A doctor with special training may recommend a CPAP machine or other appliance that can open your airway. He may also want you to have surgery, and you'd go to an oral surgeon. The type of surgery you'd have would depend on what's blocking your breathing."
442,"If I have problems with my teeth, gums, or jaws, why should I talk to my dentist first?","If you have problems with your teeth, gums, or jaws, go see your dentist, even if the pain is in the area around your mouth or face. If it's an emergency and a dentist is not available, head to an urgent care clinic rather than the ER. It's best, though, to try to avoid both if possible. They will only administer medication for the symptoms and tell you to see a dentist. They may also charge 3 to 4 times what it may cost to solve the problem. Your dentist can handle most oral problems. If he thinks you need an oral surgeon, he'll recommend one."
442,"What are oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and what kind of training do they get?","If your dentist recommends maxillofacial surgery, he's talking about a specialty of dentistry that relates to your face and jaws. It's a surgery that treats disease and injuries of the areas around your mouth. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must complete extra training and education beyond what is normal for a dentist. Some get a medical degree (an MD) along with their oral surgery diplomas. They put in at least 4 years of training in a hospital-based surgical program alongside medical residents in many different specialties, including anesthesia. That includes various types of IV sedation, including ""twilight sleep"" and general anesthesia, where you're unconscious and can't feel any pain."
442,Can an oral surgeon help correct overbites and underbites?,"An oral surgeon can help you out of several situations. Overbite/underbite: If your jaw or teeth aren't aligned properly, your dentist may recommend orthognathic surgery. It's an option for people with excessive overbites or underbites, trouble chewing or swallowing, certain birth defects, or sleep apnea. Often, an orthodontist can correct your teeth if they don't line up. But if it's caused by your jaw, some time with an oral surgeon might be necessary."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from vaginal sex?,"Yes, and either partner can get it! A woman can get HIV through the tissue that lines her vagina and cervix. The virus can get into a man through the opening of his penis or through a small cut or sore on it. Effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) will greatly reduce the chances that an HIV infected person can give HIV to his/her partner in this way. However, even when HIV drugs are used, use a condom to cut your chances of the virus passing between you, as well as getting any other sexually transmitted infections."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a blood transfusion?,"HIV isn't spread through saliva. But if you kiss someone who's infected and has bleeding gums or sores, you could get the virus if you also have cuts or sores around or in your mouth -- because of the blood-to-blood contact. Careful testing makes sure that blood bank supplies are HIV-free."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a hug?,"In fact, it's a lot harder to give it to someone else. HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Hugging and shaking hands are safe."
443,"Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from someone's tears, sweat, vomit, or pee?","HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Not like that. Sweat and tears don't carry HIV. And even though they might have a trace of blood, there have been no reported cases of HIV from vomit or pee."
443,"Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if someone with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) bites, scratches, or spits on you?","HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. HIV isn't spread through saliva. But if you kiss someone who's infected and has bleeding gums or sores, you could get the virus if you also have cuts or sores around or in your mouth -- because of the blood-to-blood contact. If you're trying to catch HIV, this is the way to have sex. But it's very rare. And if your skin doesn't break, there's no chance."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from anal sex?,"HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Yes, and either partner can get it! And while condoms work to protect you if they stay in place, they're more likely to break during this kind of sex. Again, effective antretroviral therapy in the HIV-infected partner will reduce the chances of passing HIV. However, condoms should be used to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from eating food made by a person with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Remember, HIV isn't in saliva, and it dies quickly once it's outside the body. The virus can't survive the cooking process or your stomach acid. Passing HIV through eating has happened only in rare cases, when children ate food that was already chewed by someone with the virus."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from touching an open wound on someone who has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"HIV isn't spread through saliva. Body fluids like blood can pass through broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes. But it's very rare."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from mosquitoes or ticks?,"You can only get it when certain fluids from someone who's infected get into your body. HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from someone's cough or sneeze?,"HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. No, the virus doesn't travel through air."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from oral sex?,"HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. You might, but it's not nearly as likely as when you have anal or vaginal sex. Still, it can happen. The person who ends up with semen or vaginal fluid in their mouth is at greater risk. Again, use a condom, latex barrier, or dental dam."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a tattoo or a body piercing?,"HIV isn't spread through saliva. In theory, yes, if the needles were used on someone with HIV before you and then not sterilized. But the CDC says no cases have been reported of someone getting the virus this way."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from kissing?,"HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. It's possible, but it hardly ever happens. HIV isn't spread through saliva. And it would still have to get through your skin or into you somehow."
443,Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from sharing needles?,"You can only get it when certain fluids from someone who's infected get into your body. No, the virus doesn't travel through air. Any of the supplies for preparing drugs for injection -- syringes, bottle caps, spoons, or containers -- could have the virus if someone with HIV used it first."
443,Can a pregnant woman infect her baby with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. A woman infected with HIV can pass the virus to her child during pregnancy or while she's giving birth, or though her breast milk. The chances are greatly reduced, however if the mother is taking effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) throughout her pregnancy, labor, and delivery."
443,"Can I get human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a toilet seat, water fountain, or drinking glasses?","You can only get it when certain fluids from someone who's infected get into your body. HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. First, there's not likely to be the right kind of body fluid on public surfaces. And if there were, the virus would probably die before you got to it; it can't live long outside a body. And it would still have to get through your skin or into you somehow. Sharing dishes, glasses, and eating utensils is safe. Remember, HIV isn't in saliva, and it dies quickly once it's outside the body."
444,How painful is herpes simplex?,"Some people experience very mild genital herpes symptoms or no symptoms at all. Frequently, people infected with the virus don't even know they have it. However, when it causes symptoms, it can be described as extremely painful. This is especially true for the first outbreak, which is often the worst. Outbreaks are described as aches or pains in or around the genital area or burning, pain, or difficulty urinating. Some people experience discharge from the vagina or penis. Oral herpes lesions (cold sores) usually cause tingling and burning just prior to the breakout of the blisters. The blisters themselves can also be painful."
444,How is herpes simplex diagnosed?,"Often, the appearance of herpes simplex virus is typical and no testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If a health care provider is uncertain, herpes simplex can be diagnosed with lab tests, including DNA -- or PCR -- tests and virus cultures."
444,What are the symptoms of herpes simplex virus?,"For many people with the herpes virus, which can go through periods of being dormant, attacks (or outbreaks) can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity Menstruation Symptoms of herpes simplex virus typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum. The blisters break, leaving tender sores."
444,How are herpes simplex viruses categorized?,"!s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Herpes simplex viruses -- more commonly known as herpes -- are categorized into two types: herpes type 1 ( HSV-1, or oral herpes) and herpes type 2 ( HSV-2, or genital herpes). Most commonly, herpes type 1 causes sores around the mouth and lips (sometimes called fever blisters or cold sores). HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2. In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum. Although HSV-2 sores may occur in other locations, these sores usually are found below the waist."
444,What conditions can lead to attacks of the herpes simplex virus?,"For many people with the herpes virus, which can go through periods of being dormant, attacks (or outbreaks) can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity Menstruation Symptoms of herpes simplex virus typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum."
444,Can herpes be cured?,"There is no cure for herpes simplex. Once a person has the virus, it remains in the body. The virus lies inactive in the nerve cells until something triggers it to become active again."
444,How is herpes simplex treated?,"Medication can decrease the pain related to an outbreak and can shorten healing time. They can also decrease the total number of outbreaks. Drugs including Famvir, Zovirax, and Valtrex are among the drugs used to treat the symptoms of herpes. Warm baths may relieve the pain associated with genital sores. There is no cure for herpes simplex."
444,What causes herpes infections and outbreaks?,"HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2. Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor, as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth. For many people with the herpes virus, which can go through periods of being dormant, attacks (or outbreaks) can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity Menstruation Symptoms of herpes simplex virus typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum. Frequently, people infected with the virus don't even know they have it."
445,How can lead get into dust?,"Although lead-based paint hasn't been sold since 1978, plenty of older homes still have it. Tiny fragments of lead paint can float through the air and accumulate on surfaces throughout your house. Babies can pick them up on their hands and get them into their mouths. They can also breathe them in directly. Contrary to what you might think, it doesn't take much. Even at very low levels of exposure, lead dust can cause harm."
445,How many U.S. kids have blood levels of lead that are too high?,"According to the Centers of Disease Control, more than half a million children ages 1-5 in the U. S. have blood lead levels high enough to damage their health. Even with treatment, lead poisoning can permanently affect a child's development. Because their bodies are small and growing, babies and young children are at greatest risk."
446,What are challenges that come with treating elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by medications?,"These include: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) Biologic drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Corticosteroids You might have more challenges with your medication, especially if you take drugs for other health conditions. This boosts your chances of a bad reaction to the medicine. You may also have a harder time with drug side effects. NSAIDs increase your chances of heart, brain, gut, and kidney problems. Corticosteroids up the odds of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and other health problems."
446,What symptoms of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) might be a different condition?,"Elderly-onset RA also has symptoms that overlap with other diseases, like: Polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) Late-onset psoriatic arthritis Crystal arthritis Viral arthritis Osteoarthritis Rotator cuff tendinitis Hypothyroidism Parkinson's disease It may be hardest to tell elderly-onset RA from PMR, which has similar aches and test results (like elevated CRP and ESR levels)."
446,Does exercise help if you have elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,Your doctor has to figure out if it's really late-onset or if you've had the disease for years.
446,What is the goal of treatment for elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"Your treatment goal is remission, the lowest possible level of disease activity. This can prevent joint damage and can keep your joints working like they should."
446,What should I know about medications for elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"You can get rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) at any age, but it's most likely to show up between ages 30 and 50. When it starts between ages 60 and 65, it's called elderly-onset RA or late-onset RA. Your doctor will probably give you the same drugs used to treat early-onset RA. These include: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) Biologic drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Corticosteroids You might have more challenges with your medication, especially if you take drugs for other health conditions. This boosts your chances of a bad reaction to the medicine. You may also have a harder time with drug side effects. NSAIDs increase your chances of heart, brain, gut, and kidney problems.

When it starts between ages 60 and 65, it's called elderly-onset RA or late-onset RA. Your doctor has to figure out if it's really late-onset or if you've had the disease for years."
446,Can you have elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis?,"You may also have a harder time with drug side effects. Even if you take RA drugs, they may not do enough to reduce your pain and keep your joints working."
446,What conditions have similar symptoms as for elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"You can get rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) at any age, but it's most likely to show up between ages 30 and 50. When it starts between ages 60 and 65, it's called elderly-onset RA or late-onset RA. Look out for: Fever Muscle pain (myalgia) Weight loss Anemia Your tab tests may show: Elevated CRP ( C-reactive protein) Elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) It can be hard to spot this condition. Your doctor has to figure out if it's really late-onset or if you've had the disease for years. Elderly-onset RA also has symptoms that overlap with other diseases, like: Polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) Late-onset psoriatic arthritis Crystal arthritis Viral arthritis Osteoarthritis Rotator cuff tendinitis Hypothyroidism Parkinson's disease It may be hardest to tell elderly-onset RA from PMR, which has similar aches and test results (like elevated CRP and ESR levels)."
446,What should you know about rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the elderly?,"You can get rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) at any age, but it's most likely to show up between ages 30 and 50. When it starts between ages 60 and 65, it's called elderly-onset RA or late-onset RA. You may hear this called acute onset. If you get RA when you're younger, symptoms tend to show up over time. Elderly-onset RA usually strikes large joints, like shoulders. With younger people, the disease mostly starts in small joints, like your fingers and toes. Rheumatoid factor ( RF) is less common in elderly-onset RA. Rheumatoid factor is a protein. If your blood tests show you have it, those proteins may attack healthy tissues. Around 80% of people with early-onset RA have RF. Overall, elderly-onset RA takes less of a toll. It tends to be less severe. The exception is if you have RF. Your RA will probably be more aggressive RA than someone who doesn't have RF. Your treatment goal is remission, the lowest possible level of disease activity."

447,What can help you remove germs from your kitchen sponge?,"Washing a sponge in the dishwasher also isn't enough to kill germs unless you have an extremely high-heat germicide cycle. As an alternative, you can use paper towels or a clean cloth; be sure to use the cloth only once and then toss it in the laundry. If you do use sponges, you can soak them between cleanings in a solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water, or vinegar and water. Soak them in the bleach solution for about 5 minutes or in the vinegar solution for 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and let air dry."
447,What can you do to help remove germs in your dishwasher?,"Do you see a black fungus on the seal around your dishwasher door or inside your dishwasher? It may be Exophiala dermatitidis, a fungus that likes high heat and is resistant to most detergents. Scrub it away with a paste of vinegar and baking soda. While you're in the dishwasher, pour a couple of cups of vinegar in the bottom and run a cycle to kill other tough germs."
447,What can help you remove germs from your kitchen cutting board?,"Disinfect cutting boards by soaking them in straight vinegar or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water for about 30 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly with hot, soapy water or put them in the dishwasher. Using the dishwasher alone isn't enough to sanitize them."
447,What can help you remove germs from your kitchen counter?,"Spraying a 10% vinegar solution on counters will wipe out lots of kitchen counter germs at once. Keep the surface wet for 30 to 60 seconds, then wipe. Keep purses, briefcases, lunchboxes, keys, mail, and electronic devices like remote controls off countertops because they're teeming with germs."
447,What can help you remove germs in your refrigerator?,"Wash the refrigerator door handle frequently with a bleach solution. It's not enough to just replace the trash bag. Wipe cabinet and refrigerator door handles at least once a week with the bleach solution to kill microorganisms. Get rid of mold in the refrigerator and dust on the countertops, for example."
448,What happens when you get ureteroscopy to treat kidney stones?,"Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible scope through your urethra, bladder and then into your ureter to reach the stone. If the stone is small, she can use a basket to remove it. If the stone is larger, a laser passed through the scope can break it up."
448,What types of prescription drugs can help with kidney stones?,"Prescription drugs can help: Calcium channel blockers and alpha-blockers: These relax your ureter, the tube through which pee passes from your kidney to your bladder. A wider ureter will help the stone move more quickly. Potassium citrate or sodium citrate: Can help keep kidney stones created by uric acid from forming."
448,What are percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy to help treat kidney stones?,Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. These similar surgical procedures are options if your stone is large or if other procedures fail to break them down enough. Your doctor uses a thin tube inserted through your skin to reach the stone and them removes (nephrolithotomy) or breaks (nephrolithotripsy) it. You will be given drugs so you won't be awake or feel pain. You'll likely have to stay in the hospital for 1-2 days.
448,What is open surgery for kidney stones?,"Open surgery: This might be an option if your stone is very oversized or your doctor can't take it out with other treatments. You'll be sedated and not awake. Your surgeon cuts through your side to reach the kidney, then takes the stone out through the opening. You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. It can take 4-6 weeks for you to fully recover. Your surgeon usually will ask a lab to identify the type of stone, so you might be able to take meds to avoid them in the future."
448,Are kidney stones painful?,Your treatment depends on where and how big your stone is and what symptoms you have. Your doctor may have to break it up or remove it. Ask your doctor: How long should I wait for my stone to pass on its own?
449,Are antidepressants used to treat bipolar depression?,"While antidepressants are effective treatment for people with major depressive (unipolar) disorder, they are not always as effective for bipolar depression, and generally should not be given alone (monotherapy) in people with bipolar I disorder. When antidepressants are given alone to someone with bipolar disorder, there's a risk the drug might ignite a manic episode in some patients."
449,Is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) a viable treatment for bipolar depression?,"Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association suggest that ECT is an appropriate and sometimes preferred treatment for depressed bipolar patients who have psychotic symptoms or a very high risk for suicidal behavior. In addition, ECT may benefit women who are pregnant and suffer with severe bipolar depression or mania."
449,How do the CNS depressants help with bipolar disorder depression?,"CNS depressants are commonly used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders and may be an effective alternative or adjunctive therapy in some bipolar patients with acute mania. Some commonly used benzodiazepines include clonazepam ( Klonopin), lorazepam ( Ativan), alprazolam ( Xanax), and diazepam ( Valium). These drugs all can be addictive and can cause sluggish thinking. They generally should be used only to treat agitation or sleep problems during the acute phase of the illness and not as long-term medications. They typically should be tapered off rather than stopped abruptly, in order to minimize the risk of drug withdrawal."
449,Can psychotherapy  help with bipolar depression?,"In addition, ECT may benefit women who are pregnant and suffer with severe bipolar depression or mania. Along with medications for bipolar depression, patients may benefit from ongoing psychotherapy. This one-on-one therapy combines interpersonal psychotherapy with behavioral techniques to help patients learn how to more effectively manage interpersonal problems, stay on their medications, and normalize their lifestyle habits. The STEP- BD study mentioned earlier found that in addition to medications, adding a structured psychotherapy -- such as cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal/social rhythm therapy, or family-focused therapy -- can speed up treatment response in bipolar depression by as much as 150%."
450,Can breast cancer treatment cause changes in weight?,"Weight loss might be due to nausea, vomiting, or appetite changes. Weight gain is sometimes brought on by chemotherapy, or hormone therapy, which can both cause early menopause. But some other medications you may take can also cause you to put on extra pounds, as can changes in your diet and being less active."
451,When should I call 911 for an insulin reaction?,"A severe reaction A seizure A loss of consciousness For a severe reaction: While waiting for emergency help, inject glucagon if you are trained to do so."
451,"If I start to feel symptoms of a mild or moderate insulin reaction, what should I do?","For moderate to mild symptoms: Give the person a high-sugar food such as: 3 to 4 glucose tablets 1/3 to 1/2 tube of glucose in gel form 1/2 cup orange juice 1/3 cup apple juice 1/4 to 1/3 cup raisins 2 large or 6 small sugar cubes in water 4 oz. to 6 oz. of regular soda, not diet 1 tablespoon of molasses, honey, or corn syrup 5 hard candies After 15 minutes, test blood sugar, if possible. If symptoms persist or blood sugar reading is below 70 mg/d L, give another high-sugar food. If the person's next meal is more than 30 minutes away, give the person a small snack, such as 1/2 sandwich, 1 oz. cheese with 4 to 6 crackers, or 1 tablespoon peanut butter with 4 to 6 crackers. If the person still doesn't feel better, go to a hospital emergency room or call 911. If you go to the hospital, doctors may give sugar intravenously."
451,What should I do in the case of a severe insulin reaction?,"A severe reaction A seizure A loss of consciousness For a severe reaction: While waiting for emergency help, inject glucagon if you are trained to do so."
452,When should you try a different opioid to avoid constipation?,"These meds work by blocking the effects that the drugs have on your gut: Lubiprostone ( Amitzia), a pill Methylnaltrexone ( Relistor), a shot Naldemedine ( Symproic), a pill Naloxegol ( Movantik), a pill All opioids can cause constipation, but some may have less of an effect than others. Some studies have found that fentanyl may cause less constipation than morphine. Tapentadol may also be easier on your intestines than oxycodone. Methadone may also be less constipating. Talk to your doctor about which drugs will give you the right balance of pain relief and fewer side effects."
453,What neurotransmitters play a role in bipolar disorder?,"Disruption of circuits that communicate using dopamine in other brain areas appears connected to psychosis and schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by distortions in reality and illogical thought patterns and behaviors. The brain chemical serotonin is connected to many body functions such as sleep, wakefulness, eating, sexual activity, impulsivity, learning, and memory. Researchers believe that abnormal functioning of brain circuits that involve serotonin as a chemical messenger contribute to mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder)."
453,Can lack of sleep cause bipolar disorder?,"Some findings show that people with bipolar disorder have a genetic predisposition to sleep-wake cycle problems that may trigger symptoms of depression and mania. The problem for those with bipolar disorder, however, is that sleep loss may lead to a mood episode such as mania (elation) in some patients. Worrying about losing sleep can increase anxiety, thus worsening the bipolar mood disorder altogether. Once a sleep-deprived person with bipolar disorder goes into the manic state, the need for sleep decreases even more."
454,How is dysthymia diagnosed?,"A mental health specialist generally makes the diagnosis based on the person's symptoms. In the case of dysthymia, these symptoms will have lasted for a longer period of time and be less severe than in patients with major depression. With dysthymia, your doctor will want to make sure that the symptoms are not a result of a physical condition, such as hypothyroidism. If you are depressed and have had depressive symptoms for more than two weeks, see your doctor or a psychiatrist. Your provider will perform a thorough medical evaluation, paying particular attention to your personal and family psychiatric history. There is no blood, X-ray or other laboratory test that can be used to diagnose dysthymia."
454,What are the signs and symptoms of dysthymia?,"Dysthymia, sometimes referred to as mild, chronic depression, is less severe and has fewer symptoms than major depression. With dysthymia, the depression symptoms can linger for a long period of time, often two years or longer."
454,Can dysthymia worsen?,It's not uncommon for a person with dysthymia to also experience an episode ofmajor depression at the same time. This is called double depression. That's why it's so important to seek an early and accurate medical diagnosis. Your doctor can then recommend the most effective treatment to help you feel yourself again.
454,What else can I do to feel better if I have dysthymia?,"Getting an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment is a major step in feeling better with chronic depression. In addition, ask your doctor about the benefits of healthy lifestyle habits such as eating a well-balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and being with close friends and family members for strong social support. These positive habits are also important in improving mood and well-being."
454,How do antidepressants help ease dysthymia?,"To treat dysthymia, doctors may use psychotherapy (talk therapy), medications such as antidepressants, or a combination of these therapies. Your doctor will assess your physical and mental health, including any other medical condition, and then find the antidepressant that is most effective with the least side effects. Antidepressants may take several weeks to work fully. They should be taken for at least six to nine months after an episode of chronic depression. In addition, it sometimes may take several weeks to safely discontinue an antidepressant, so let your doctor guide you if you choose to stop the drug. Sometimes antidepressants have uncomfortable side effects. That's why you have to work closely with your doctor to find the antidepressant that gives you the most benefit with the least side effects."
454,What is dysthymia?,"With dysthymia, the depression symptoms can linger for a long period of time, often two years or longer. Those who suffer from dysthymia can also experience periods of major depression--sometimes called ""double depression."" In modern diagnostic classification systems, dysthymia and chronic depression are now both referred to as âpersistent depressive disorders. In the case of dysthymia, these symptoms will have lasted for a longer period of time and be less severe than in patients with major depression."
455,What does a complete blood count for polycythemia vera measure?,"Your doctor may order any of these tests: Complete blood count Blood smear Erythropoietin level Complete blood count: The complete blood count ( CBC) is often the test first that shows you might have PV. It measures: Hemoglobin. This is a protein that helps your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Hematocrit. To understand hematocrit, think of your blood as colored marbles in a jar of water. Red marbles are your red blood cells. Hematocrit is a number. It tells you how much room the red marbles take up in that jar -- or how much room your red blood cells take up in your blood. Number of blood cells. You have three kinds of blood cells: red, white, and platelets. The CBC counts how many of each you have. High numbers for hemoglobin, hematocrit, or blood cell count can all be signs of PV."
455,What blood tests will I need if I am being tested for polycythemia vera?,"Blood tests are common when checking for PV. Even if you've already had one, you may need another. Your doctor may order any of these tests: Complete blood count Blood smear Erythropoietin level Complete blood count: The complete blood count ( CBC) is often the test first that shows you might have PV."
455,How do I get tested for polycythemia vera?,"If your doctor thinks you have PV, you'll start with a physical exam. Then you may need: Blood tests A bone marrow test A genetic test You may not get all of these tests, but you're likely to get some of them. This helps you know for sure that you have PV and not a similar blood disease. Your doctor will probably send to you a hematologist -- a doctor who treats blood diseases."
455,What is a blood smear for polycythemia vera?,"Blood smear: Like the CBC, a blood smear gives a blood cell count. It also shows the shape of your blood cells. This helps your doctor know if you have PV and how advanced it might be."
455,What questions should I ask if I am being tested for polycythemia vera?,"You may want to write down any questions you have so you remember them. For example, you could ask: What's the cause of my condition? What tests do I need? When will I find out about my results? How I can learn more about PV?"
455,How long does a complete blood count for polycythemia vera take?,"The CBC takes only a few minutes. Your doctor puts a thin needle into your arm, usually near your elbow, and draws blood. You may have results in 1-2 days, but it can take longer."
455,What is a gene test for polycythemia vera and how long does it take?,"Most people with PV have a problem in a gene called JAK2. Your doctor can use a blood sample or a bone marrow sample from a biopsy to check your JAK2 gene. You can get results in 4-6 days, but your lab may take longer."
455,What is erythropoietin level test for polycythemia vera?,Erythropoietin level: Erythropoietin ( EPO) is a hormone that tells your bone marrow to make new blood cells. A very low level can be another sign of PV.
455,How long does a blood smear for polycythemia vera take?,The blood smear is a quick test. Your doctor may draw blood from your arm or by pricking your finger. You usually get the results in 1-2 days.
455,What happens if my tests show that I have polycythemia vera?,"If tests show that you have PV, your doctor can help you choose the best treatment for you and closely follow your health in the years to come to make sure you don't have complications. Most people with PV can live a normal life. With the right care, you can limit your symptoms and, in some cases, make them go away completely."
455,How does a complete blood count show polycythemia vera?,"High numbers for hemoglobin, hematocrit, or blood cell count can all be signs of PV."
455,How long do bone marrow tests for polycythemia vera take?,"There are two kinds of bone marrow tests: Aspiration uses a liquid bone marrow sample Biopsy uses a solid bone marrow sample Both tests show if your bone marrow is making too many blood cells. You may get both tests done at the same time. Your doctor first numbs an area around either your breastbone or your pelvic bone. You can get results in 3-4 days, but it may take longer."
456,What bisphosphonate drugs can treat advanced prostate cancer?,"Other hormonal treatments include antiandrogens, estrogen- and progesterone-type drugs and cortisone derivatives."
456,How can external beam radiation therapy treat advanced prostate cancer?,"Plus, radiation therapy directed at the bone can reduce pain caused by bone metastases."
456,How does MRI scanning treat advanced prostate cancer?,A newer noninvasive procedure uses MRI scanning to focus the energy from ultrasound in order to destroy nerve endings in the bone around the tumor. This can provide relief from bone pain with a low risk of complications.
456,What is advanced prostate cancer?,"Prostate cancer is defined as ''advanced'' when it spreads outside the prostate gland. It may spread to nearby tissues, lymph nodes, bones, or other parts of the body. When it is spread beyond the tissues directly adjacent to the prostate gland, it is called metastatic prostate cancer."
456,How does Xofigo treat advanced prostate cancer?,"One drug, Xofigo ( Radium -223), is approved for use in men who have advanced prostate cancer that has spread only to the bones. Candidates should have also received androgen deprivation therapy. Xofigo, given by injection once a month, works by binding to minerals within bones to deliver radiation directly to bone tumors. A study of 809 men showed that those taking Xofigo lived an average of 3 months longer than those taking a placebo."
456,How does Provenge treat advanced prostate cancer?,"If hormone therapy ultimately fails to slow the growth of the cancer, the next step may be a prostate cancer ""vaccine"" called Provenge (sipuleucel- T). Most men who take Provenge survive at least 2 years after starting the treatment. Provenge isn't your everyday vaccine. It's a therapy created by taking immune cells from a patient, genetically engineering them to fight prostate cancer, and then putting them back into the patient. It's used for men with few or no symptoms and when advanced prostate cancer no longer responds to hormone therapy."
456,How does androgen deprivation therapy treat advanced prostate cancer?,"A look at treatments: Most prostate cancer grows in response to male hormones (androgens) in the body, such as testosterone. That's why one of the first treatments for advanced prostate cancer is to decrease these hormone levels (called androgen deprivation therapy). There are several medications that can do this, including Lupron (leuprolide), Trelstar (triptorelin), or Zoladex (goserelin). These drugs work to reduce testosterone levels to those seen in castrated patients."
456,How are patients with advanced prostate cancer able to enroll in clinical trials?,Clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of these new methods and treatments. There are risks and limitations in every clinical trial. The National Institutes of Health lists clinical trials at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
457,When do you need medical attention for dizziness?,"Get medical attention immediately if you're dizzy and you faint, fall, or can't walk or have any of the following: Chest pain Different or really bad headache Head injury High fever Irregular heart rate Seizures Shortness of breath Stiff neck Sudden change in speech, vision, or hearing Vomiting Weakness or numbness in your face Weakness in your leg or arm Does it feel like you're spinning or the room is moving around you?"
457,How can low blood sugar cause dizziness?,"You can get dizzy if it drops too low. That also can cause hunger, shakiness, sweating, and confusion. Some people without diabetes also have trouble with low blood sugar, but that's rare. A quick fix is to eat or drink something with sugar, like juice or a hard candy."
457,What medications can cause dizziness as a side effect?,"Several drugs list dizziness as a possible side effect. Check with your doctor if you take: Antibiotics, including gentamicin and streptomycin Anti-depressants Anti-seizure medications Blood pressure medicine Sedatives Many people don't drink enough fluids to replace the liquid they lose every day when they sweat, breathe, and pee."
457,How can an infection cause dizziness?,"This is called vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, and it's caused by an infection. Usually, a virus is to blame. But bacteria from a middle ear infection or meningitis can make their way into your inner ear as well. In this case, dizziness usually comes on suddenly. Your ears may ring, and it may be hard to hear. You also may be nauseated and have a fever and ear pain. Symptoms can last several weeks. If it's caused by a virus and can't be treated with antibiotics, medication can help make you feel better as the infection runs its course. That also can cause hunger, shakiness, sweating, and confusion."
457,Why am I dizzy?,"When a part of that system is off, you can feel dizzy. It can be a sign of something serious, and it can be dangerous if it makes you fall. Your doctor will look at all your symptoms and overall health to figure out what's going on and how to treat it. Inflammation of the nerves in your ears also can cause vertigo."
457,How can Meniere's disease cause dizziness?,"That's a classic sign of a particular type of dizziness called vertigo. You may feel fullness or pressure in one ear. Other symptoms include ringing in your ears, hearing loss, nausea, and anxiety. You may feel exhausted after the attack passes. People with Meniere's disease have too much fluid in their inner ear. Doctors don't know what causes it, and there's no cure for it. It's usually treated with diet changes (a low-salt diet) and medicine to control the dizziness."
458,What are the risks of heart bypass surgery?,"Some of the possible ones include: Fever Heart attack Infection and bleeding at the incision Memory loss Pain Reactions to anesthesia Stroke Once you've recovered, your symptoms of angina will be gone or much better."
458,What is heart bypass surgery like?,"A surgeon takes blood vessels from another part of your body to go around, or bypass, a blocked artery. The result is that more blood and oxygen can flow to your heart again."
459,What is cholesterol ratio and what should yours be?,"To find your cholesterol ratio, you divide your total cholesterol number by your HDL, or good, cholesterol number. For example, if your total cholesterol number is 200 and your good cholesterol is 50, your total cholesterol ratio is 4:1. Cholesterol ratio may be used as a monitoring tool by some health care specialists. However, the AHA suggests that doctors use LDLcholesterol with patients rather than cholesterol ratio. That's because the total cholesterol number is considered a better tool for guiding the doctor in planning the best patient care and helping patients understand their health risks. Discuss with your doctor what the best numbers to monitor for you are."
459,What is cholesterol?,"Cholesterol performs important functions in your body. It aids in tissue and hormone formation. It protects your nerves. It helps with digestion. In fact, cholesterol helps form the structure of every cell in your body. This waxy, fat-like substance is produced naturally -- mainly in our liver. But it also comes from the food we eat -- like eggs, fatty meats, and cheese."
460,What tests are used to diagnose schizoaffective disorder?,There are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose schizoaffective disorder. So doctors rely on your medical history and your answers to certain questions.
460,What are symptoms of depression in schizoaffective disorder?,"In order to get diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, you must have: Periods of uninterrupted illness An episode of mania, major depression, or a mix of both Symptoms of schizophrenia At least two periods of psychotic symptoms, each lasting 2 weeks."
460,What is the definition of bipolar disorder?,"Schizoaffective disorder has the features of schizophrenia, like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, along with those of a mood disorder, like mania and depression."
460,What is the definition of schizophrenia?,"Brain chemistry and structure: If you have schizophrenia and mood disorders, you might have problems with brain circuits that manage mood and thinking."
460,How can you diagnose someone with schizoaffective disorder?,"In order to get diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, you must have: Periods of uninterrupted illness An episode of mania, major depression, or a mix of both Symptoms of schizophrenia At least two periods of psychotic symptoms, each lasting 2 weeks. One of the episodes must happen without depressive or manic symptoms."
460,When do you need hospitalization for schizoaffective disorder?,"Hospitalization: Psychotic episodes may require a hospital stay, especially if you're suicidal or threaten to hurt others."
460,How does skills training treat schizoaffective disorder?,"Skills training: This generally focuses on work and social skills, grooming and self-care, and other day-to-day activities, including money and home management."
460,What is the definition of depression?,People who have it often have problems with substance use as well.
460,How does psychotherapy treat schizoaffective disorder?,"Psychotherapy: The goal of this type of counseling is to help you learn about your illness, set goals, and manage everyday problems related to the disorder. Family therapy can help families get better at relating to and helping a loved one who has schizoaffective disorder."
460,What causes schizoaffective disorder?,Scientists don't know for sure if schizoaffective disorder is related mainly to schizophrenia or a mood disorder. But it's usually viewed and treated as a combination of both conditions.
460,Can you prevent schizoaffective disorder?,"But if you're diagnosed and start treatment ASAP, it can help you avoid or ease frequent relapses and hospitalizations, and help cut the disruptions in your life, family, and friendships."
460,What can cause schizoaffective disorder?,"Trouble at work, school, or in social settings Scientists don't know the exact cause. Risk factors for schizoaffective disorder include: Genetics: You may inherit a tendency to get features linked to schizoaffective disorder from your parents. Brain chemistry and structure: If you have schizophrenia and mood disorders, you might have problems with brain circuits that manage mood and thinking. Schizophrenia is also tied to lower levels of dopamine, a brain chemical that also helps manage these tasks. Environment: Some scientists think things like viral infections or highly stressful situations could play a part in getting schizoaffective disorder if you're at risk for it. How that happens isn't clear."
460,What are symptoms of schizophrenia in schizoaffective disorder?,"Schizoaffective disorder has the features of schizophrenia, like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, along with those of a mood disorder, like mania and depression."
460,How is schizoaffective disorder often misdiagnosed?,"Because schizoaffective disorder combines symptoms that reflect two mental illnesses, it's easily confused with other psychotic or mood disorders. Some doctors may diagnose schizophrenia. Others may think it's a mood disorder. As a result, it's hard to know how many people actually have schizoaffective disorder. It's probably less common than either schizophrenia or mood disorders alone."
460,When does schizoaffective disorder happen?,"It's equally likely to affect men and women, but men usually get it at a younger age. It seems to happen slightly more often in women than in men."
461,What will your doctor recommend to help you cope with your symptoms of ataxia?,"In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Counseling Physical or occupational therapy Speech therapy Support groups Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily."
461,What is idiopathic ataxia?,"When you haven't inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it's called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if he can't find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy, or MSA. Doctors haven't pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes."
461,What is vestibular ataxia?,"Symptoms of sensory ataxia include: Difficulty touching your finger to your nose with closed eyes Inability to sense vibrations Trouble walking in dim light Walking with a âheavy step,â or stomping when you walk Vestibular ataxia affects your vestibular system. This system is made up of your inner ear and ear canals, which contain fluid. They sense the movements of your head and help with your balance and spatial orientation."
461,How many people in the United States are affected by ataxia?,"When the nerves in your vestibular system wear away, you can have the following problems: Blurred vision and other eye issues Nausea and vomiting Problems standing and sitting Staggering when you walk Trouble walking in a straight line Vertigo, or dizziness Around 150,000 people in the U. S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause."
461,What are symptoms of sensory ataxia?,"Symptoms of sensory ataxia include: Difficulty touching your finger to your nose with closed eyes Inability to sense vibrations Trouble walking in dim light Walking with a âheavy step,â or stomping when you walk Vestibular ataxia affects your vestibular system."
461,What is genetic ataxia?,"You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom."
461,What are symptoms of vestibular ataxia?,"When the nerves in your vestibular system wear away, you can have the following problems: Blurred vision and other eye issues Nausea and vomiting Problems standing and sitting Staggering when you walk Trouble walking in a straight line Vertigo, or dizziness Around 150,000 people in the U. S. deal with some form of ataxia."
461,How is ataxia diagnosed?,"He'll check your balance and coordination, hearing, vision, reflexes, and memory. You'll also need a neurological exam, which might include an MRI or CT scan. These look at the structure of your brain for problems. For some cases, your doctor may recommend tests of your spinal fluid. To do this, he'll insert a needle into your lower back and draw out the fluid to send it to a lab for testing. To rule out genetic forms of ataxia, you may need genetic testing."
461,What are causes of acquired ataxia?,"Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include: Brain tumors Blood loss in the brain Cerebral palsy Chickenpox Hydrocephalus, or too much fluid buildup in the brain Head trauma Multiple sclerosis Reactions to certain cancers Vitamin E or B12 deficiency You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications, from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison."
461,What are treatments for ataxia?,"The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it's due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia."
461,What is acquired ataxia?,Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness.
462,What is the use of nanomedicine in treating multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"In some cases, nanoparticles act as tiny cargo ships that carry medicine -- sometimes, to parts of the body drugs can't reach on their own. For example, they can cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of cells that protect your brain from possible danger -- but that also keep helpful MS drugs from getting through. Attaching MS drugs to nanoparticles may solve this problem. That's because certain nanoparticles can interact with blood-brain barrier cells and get âswallowedâ by them. When the nanoparticle gets in, so does the drug it carries. Another type of nanoparticle doesn't even need to carry medicine. The material itself is a powerful antioxidant that crosses the blood-brain barrier. It's called a cerium oxide nanoparticle, and it helped relieve some MS symptoms in mice."
462,What are recent findings and ongoing research on the root causes of MS?,"Scientists are looking for ways to: Stop the disease from getting worse Restore lost function Prevent and cure MS Besides testing new treatments, scientists continue to explore the root causes of MS. Much of the research is still being done in animals, but recent findings and ongoing research include: Bone marrow stem cell transplants that would offer long-term benefits An epilepsy pill that slowed nerve damage A specific type of training that improved memory and brain activity (as seen on MRI scans). Changes were still in place after 6 months. An experimental therapy in mice helped their bodies make myelin, a substance that protects nerves. The treatment is a type of micro RNA, a small amount of genetic material. A large team of researchers is analyzing gut bacteria to find out what role it may play as MS gets worse. Researchers are studying children with MS to learn how their environment and genes make them more likely to get the disease. One early finding suggested low vitamin D levels were linked to MS relapses in kids with a specific gene."
462,How does stem transplant work in treating multiple sclerosis?,"You might hear your doctor call it: Stem cell transplant Bone marrow transplant HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) How does it work? Doctors remove and store cells from your body that make blood. Then, you take chemotherapy drugs to wipe out your immune system. After that, your stem cells go back in your body. They travel to your bone marrow, where they make new blood cells, giving your immune system a fresh start. Studies show that bone marrow stem cell transplants might help some people with MS. However, the treatment is still experimental."
462,What do I need to know about stem cells transplant in treating multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"These are the only cells in your body with the power to create new types of cells. For example, your blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle, and bone all come from stem cells. People who need new, healthy cells to fight a disease like cancer often get bone marrow stem cell transplants. This procedure can help rebuild your immune system by producing new blood cells. You might hear your doctor call it: Stem cell transplant Bone marrow transplant HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) How does it work?"
462,What do I need to know about multiple sclerosis (MS) research roundup?,"New technologies and insights are speeding the pace of discovery. In fact, there are more MS treatments in development now than ever before. MS is a neurological disease that can cause extreme tiredness, vision changes, trouble moving, and other problems. Scientists are looking for ways to: Stop the disease from getting worse Restore lost function Prevent and cure MS Besides testing new treatments, scientists continue to explore the root causes of MS. Much of the research is still being done in animals, but recent findings and ongoing research include: Bone marrow stem cell transplants that would offer long-term benefits An epilepsy pill that slowed nerve damage A specific type of training that improved memory and brain activity (as seen on MRI scans). Nanomedicine research is still in the early stages."
463,How is Giardiasis treated?,"Many people get better without treatment. But if your symptoms last more than several weeks, or you're likely to spread the parasite, your doctor can give you medication. Metronidazole ( Flagyl), nitazoxanide ( Alinia), and tinidazole ( Tindamax) are among the drugs used to treat giardia infections."

475,Could a brain tumor make my vision blurry?,"Scary, but true: A tumor in any part of your brain can make pressure build inside your skull. That can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision. Other signs of a possible brain tumor are: Drowsiness Headache that won't go away Nausea Personality changes Seizures Vomiting If your doctor thinks you might have a brain tumor, she'll use different tests to check how well your brain and spinal cord work, as well as imaging tests to see inside your head."
475,Is my blurry vision caused by a stroke?,"One of the key signs that you're having a stroke is a sudden, painless change in eyesight. You might have blurry or double vision."
475,Is my blurry vision caused by Parkinson's disease?,"That causes a condition called optic neuritis, which can give you blurry sight, loss of color vision, and pain when you move your eyes. Blurry vision is not the first sign of this nerve disease. As your sight seems less sharp, you may strain your eyes because they have to work harder to focus."
475,Is my blurry vision caused by a migraine?,"There are a host of other symptoms that you might have with the pain, including blurry vision and sensitivity to light. You may feel these signs even before a migraine starts, and they may last until it's over. More dramatic changes to your eyesight during a migraine are called an aura. They can include: Loss of part or all of your vision for a little while Seeing flashes of light Seeing wavy lines or spots To solve these problems, you'll need to work with your doctor to treat your migraines and keep them from starting. Parkinson's disease affects much more than the eyes."
476,What are the early symptoms of mononucleosis?,"The early symptoms of mononucleosis are like those of the flu, including: Severe fatigue Headache Sore throat, which sometimes can be very severe Chills, followed by a fever Muscle aches After a day or two, someone with mono may also have: Swollen lymph nodes Jaundice (a yellow tinge to the skin and eyes) A measles-like skin rash anywhere on the face or body."
477,When should you call your doctor about colorectal cancer?,"So you'll need to check with your doctor to find out what's going on. Don't just assume it's hemorrhoids. Make an appointment if you have any of the symptoms, or if a doctor tells you that you have anemia. ( When doctors look for the cause of anemia, they should check for bleeding from the digestive tract because of colorectal cancer.)"
478,What is the treatment for lipodystrophy?,"But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections ( Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, she'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control her blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse. Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, she may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out her face with skin grafts from her thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for her appearance makes sense and when."
478,What should you expect if you have lipodystrophy?,"Over time, people with AGL can lose most or all of their body fat. With APL, it typically stops after a few years. In general, the more fat you lose, the more serious the condition is. Yet many people with lipodystrophy live active, productive lives. You'll need to work closely with your doctor to prevent complications. For example, people with AGL are likely to have heart and liver problems. Diabetes can be hard to control. They might develop autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo (light-colored spots of skin), rheumatoid arthritis, and a kind of hepatitis. People with APL probably won't have the insulin-related problems that often come with AGL. But it can lead to kidneys that don't work well or at all, and drusen, tiny fat deposits in the back of the eyes that may be connected to age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Women may get extra fat on their hips and thighs. AGL and APL can be linked to autoimmune disorders, too, including rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Researchers are studying lipodystrophy, and they may find more ways to treat it."
478,What are acquired lipodystrophies?,"Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy ( AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy ( APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer- Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. APL typically starts around ages 8-10. Both conditions affect girls 3 times more often than boys. Both cause a person to lose fat from her face, so she may look sick or much older than she is. Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble. However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications."
478,What will your doctor look for to diagnose lipodystrophy?,"Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells."
478,How can a urine test help to diagnose a lipodystrophy?,"Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells."
478,How can you take care of your child with lipodystrophy?,"Because this condition affects how you look, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and being supportive. Set the tone for others. Be positive and open-minded. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying, or offending or embarrassing you and your child. When someone asks about her, be matter-of-fact about her condition. Do what you can to boost her self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. Encourage friendships. But kids will be kids, so prepare her for unkind looks and words. You can help her practice how she'll react with role-play and humor. Consider professional counseling. Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease."
478,What are the symptoms of acquired partial lipodystrophy (AGL)?,"This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with her face and moves to her neck, arms, and chest."
478,Where can you get support for lipodystrophy?,"If you're looking for a community, Lipodystrophy United is a good place to start. It has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families."
478,What questions should you ask your doctor about a lipodystrophy?,"What type of lipodystrophy is this? Do you know what caused it? Do we need any more tests? How many other people with this condition have you treated? What's the best way for us to treat it? What other symptoms should we watch for? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research trial?"
478,What are the symptoms of localized lipodystrophy?,"This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps."
478,What are types of acquired lipodystrophies?,"Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy ( AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy ( APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer- Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too."
478,How is a lipodystrophy diagnosis confirmed?,"Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells."
478,What questions will my doctor ask for lipodystrophy diagnosis?,"When you go to the doctor, he'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child's health: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Are changes in how she looks only in certain areas, or all over? Has she had panniculitis -- swollen bumps under her skin or a bumpy red rash? Does she have diabetes? What other health problems or recent injuries has she had? Have you had her blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked?"
478,What are the symptoms of acquired partial lipodystrophy?,"This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with her face and moves to her neck, arms, and chest."
478,Is there a community for people with lipodystrophy?,"If you're looking for a community, Lipodystrophy United is a good place to start. It has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families."
478,What questions should I ask my doctor about lipodystrophy?,"What type of lipodystrophy is this? Do you know what caused it? Do we need any more tests? How many other people with this condition have you treated? What's the best way for us to treat it? What other symptoms should we watch for? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research trial?"
478,Who can get lipodystrophy?,Some people with HIV get lipodystrophy ( LD- HIV). It may be related to the medicines they take or the disease itself.
478,What causes lipodystrophy?,"Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: An infection, such as measles, pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or hepatitis A disease where your immune system attacks your body (called an autoimmune disease) Repeated injections in or pressure on the same place on your body An injury For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots."
478,Can children get localized lipodystrophy?,"Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble."
478,What is lipodystrophy?,"It often affects the fat that's just under your skin, so it can change the way you look. It also can cause other changes in your body. Some people with HIV get lipodystrophy ( LD- HIV). It may be related to the medicines they take or the disease itself. Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy ( AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy ( APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer- Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. That's a good reason to change your injection site often."
478,What are the symptoms of acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL)?,"The type your child has will affect: Where it happens How much fat is lost Other effects on her body AGL. She'll lose fat from under the skin all over her body, including her face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of her feet. She could look very muscular, and you'll be able to see veins under her skin. Kids with AGL are very hungry all the time and grow fast. Adults may have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone if their hormone balance is off and they've kept growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris and ovaries, penis and testicles). A woman might have irregular periods or none at all. She could have polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS). She'll probably have extra hair on her upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet. Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in her body or controlling her blood sugar and triglyceride levels. She could have a large liver or spleen. What type of lipodystrophy is this?"
479,How can I find a dermatologist to treat my psoriasis?,"When you look for a dermatologist, start by asking your primary care doctor for a recommendation. You can also check with the American Academy of Dermatology, which has lists of specially trained doctors."
479,How can you choose a doctor for psoriasis?,"When you look for a dermatologist, start by asking your primary care doctor for a recommendation. You can also check with the American Academy of Dermatology, which has lists of specially trained doctors. A nearby medical school is another resource. Do you have a special area of interest in skin care?"
480,How can cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) cause stroke?,"Blood clots: Either kind of cardioversion could knock loose blood clots created from your abnormal heartbeat. Before the procedure, your doctor may do a type of ultrasound to look for blood clots in your heart. You'll probably get medicine to take for 3-4 weeks before and after the procedure to help prevent blood clots. Stroke : If a clot travels to your brain, it can cause a stroke."
480,How effective is cardioversion for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,It might not work: Cardioversion doesn't always fix a fast or irregular heartbeat. You may need medicine or a pacemaker to control things.
480,What is the success rate of electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"How well it works depends on the size of your left atrium as well as how long you've been in AFib. If you have a large left atrium or you've been in constant AFib for a year or two, it may not work as well. Taking antiarrhythmic drugs can also prevent AFib after a successful electrical cardioversion."
480,How does cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) work?,"Your doctor uses a special machine to send electrical energy to the heart muscle. The procedure restores a normal heart rate and rhythm, allowing your heart to pump better."
480,How can chemical cardioversion help with treating atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"Chemical cardioversion: If your arrhythmia isn't an emergency, a doctor will usually use medication to get your heart back to normal. This is called chemical or pharmacologic cardioversion. You typically get the medicine through an IV while doctors check your heart. But sometimes, people can take it as a pill."
480,What are the concerns about cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"It might make things worse: It's unlikely, but there's a small chance that cardioversion could damage your heart or lead to more arrhythmias. Irritated skin: This often happens where the paddles are applied. The doctor can give you a cream to treat it."
480,What is the success rate of chemical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"Chemical cardioversion: You should know quickly if it works. It usually takes effect within hours, but sometimes it takes days. If it doesn't work for you, the doctor might suggest electrical cardioversion."
480,How can electrical cardioversion help with treating for AFib?,"Electrical cardioversion gives shocks through paddles to regulate your heartbeat. First, you'll get medicine to make you fall asleep. Then, your doctor will put the paddles on your chest, and sometimes your back. These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal. Most people only need one. Because you're sedated, you probably won't remember being shocked. You can usually go home the same day."
480,How does cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) cause blood clots?,"Blood clots: Either kind of cardioversion could knock loose blood clots created from your abnormal heartbeat. Before the procedure, your doctor may do a type of ultrasound to look for blood clots in your heart. You'll probably get medicine to take for 3-4 weeks before and after the procedure to help prevent blood clots."
480,What is recovery for cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) like?,"These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal. You'll go back to your doctor in a few weeks for an electrocardiogram (you may hear it called an EKG) to make sure your beat is still regular. Keep up with your doctor visits and follow your treatment plan, which may also include antiarrhythmic drugs to help your heart maintain its normal rhythm. Let him know if you have any questions or notice any changes in your condition."
480,How do defibrillation and electric cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AFib) differ?,"But sometimes, people can take it as a pill. These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal. In defibrillation, doctors use high-voltage shocks to treat life-threatening arrhythmias or a heart that has stopped."
481,What are the benefits of exercise in adults with ADHD?,"Fitness can have the following benefits for adults with ADHD: Ease stress and anxiety. Improve impulse control and reduce compulsive behavior. Enhance working memory. Improve executive function. That's the set of skills needed to plan, organize, and remember details. Increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. That's a protein involved in learning and memory. It's in short supply in people with ADHD."
481,What are the other benefits of exercise relative to ADHD symptoms?,"Beyond helping with ADHD symptoms, exercise has several other benefits. Getting regular workouts can help you: Stay at a healthy weight. That's important because evidence suggests that people with ADHD are more likely to become obese. Reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in a normal range. Strengthen your bones. Improve your mood and self-esteem."
481,How can exercise help adults with ADHD?,"When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals called neurotransmitters, including dopamine, which help with attention and clear thinking. People with ADHD often have less dopamine than usual in their brain. The stimulant medicines that are often used to treat adult ADHD work by increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain. So it makes sense that a workout can have many of the same effects as stimulant drugs."
481,How can ADHD affect adults?,Fitness can have the following benefits for adults with ADHD: Ease stress and anxiety.
481,Can adults have ADHD?,"Adults can have this condition, too. ADHD can make it hard for adults to pay attention, control their emotions, and finish tasks."
481,How often should adults with ADHD exercise?,"Health experts recommend that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. That works out to about 30 minutes of fitness a day, five days a week."
481,What are the benefits of exercise beyond helping ADHD symptoms?,"Beyond helping with ADHD symptoms, exercise has several other benefits. Getting regular workouts can help you: Stay at a healthy weight. That's important because evidence suggests that people with ADHD are more likely to become obese. Reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in a normal range. Strengthen your bones. Improve your mood and self-esteem."
481,Does exercise help ADHD in adults?,"Research is finding that getting regular fitness can improve thinking ability, and it may improve the symptoms of adult ADHD."
481,How often should you exercise to help with adult ADHD?,"That works out to about 30 minutes of fitness a day, five days a week. If you're doing more intense aerobic workouts -- such as running or taking indoor cycling classes -- you can get away with about 75 minutes of exercise a week. As long as you're sweating and your heart is pumping, you're likely to see real, positive effects from exercise on your ADHD symptoms."
481,How are adults with ADHD treated?,"Research is finding that getting regular fitness can improve thinking ability, and it may improve the symptoms of adult ADHD. Beyond helping with ADHD symptoms, exercise has several other benefits. Getting regular workouts can help you: Stay at a healthy weight."
482,How much can you whiten your teeth?,"So if you change the color of the teeth around them, you might wind up with an uneven smile or need to replace old fillings and crowns."
482,What should I do before I whiten my teeth at home?,"Get a professional cleaning and mouth exam, even if you decide to whiten your teeth at home. You might only need a thorough cleaning to restore your smile's sparkle. Your dentist will also look for cavities and check the health of your gums during the exam. Treating any problems before you whiten is safer for your mouth. Ask your dentist about which over-the-counter system to use and how much lightening you can expect. Teeth do darken with age, and the amount of color change varies from person to person."
482,What should you keep in mind when buying at-home whiteners for teeth?,"At-home whiteners have peroxides, typically carbamide peroxide, in amounts ranging from 10% to 20%. Choose a product with a peroxide level somewhere in the middle of that range. If the product doesn't bother your mouth but doesn't provide the lightening effect you want, you can choose a higher level. If you have any questions, your dentist can help you find the whitener that best fits your needs."
482,What are the side effects of at-home teeth whiteners?,Ask your dentist about which over-the-counter system to use and how much lightening you can expect. Don't leave the strips or gels on longer than advised -- you might wind up with sore gums and set yourself up for other problems. It's a good idea to stop using the product if you start having this problem.
483,How many servings of fruit and vegetables should I eat to lose weight without fad diets?,"How many depends on your age, sex, and activity level. A good reference point for adults is 2 to 3 cups of vegetables and 1.5 to 2 servings of fruits a day."
483,How can I stock my kitchen if I want to lose weight without fad diets?,"Then, fill your fridge and cupboards with lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, good fats, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. Pile on the salad and super servings of green beans, broccoli, cabbage, kale, or other low-calorie vegetables instead of high-fat foods, breads, pasta, and desserts."
484,What are the side effects of using opioids for pain relief?,Side effects of opioids may include: Drowsiness Nausea Constipation Itching Breathing problems Addiction Antidepressants are drugs that can treat pain and/or emotional conditions by adjusting levels of neurotransmitters (natural chemicals) in the brain.
484,What are some other pain relievers?,"The most common side effects include: Drowsiness Dizziness Fatigue Nausea Another means of topical pain relief comes in the form of a lidocaine ( Lidoderm) patch, which is a prescription medication. If your pain is not relieved by the usual treatments, your doctor may refer you to a pain management specialist. Doctors who specialize in pain management may try other treatments such as certain types of physical therapy or other kinds of medicine. They may also recommend TENS, a procedure that uses patches placed on the skin to send signals that may help stop pain. Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) is a method of pain control that allows the patient to control the amount of pain medication administered. This is often used in the hospital to treat pain. By pushing a button on a computerized pump, the patient receives a pre-measured dose of pain medicine. The pump is connected to a small tube that allows medicine to be injected intravenously (into a vein), subcutaneously (just under the skin), or into the spinal area."
484,What are opioids?,"Some examples of opioids include: Morphine Fentanyl Oxycodone Codeine Opioids are effective for severe pain and do not cause bleeding in the stomach or other parts of the body, as can some other types of pain relievers. It is rare for people to become addicted to opioids if the drugs are used to treat pain for a short period of time."
484,What are some over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers?,"Over-the-counter ( OTC) pain relievers include: Acetaminophen ( Tylenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), including ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil) or naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs reduce fever and relieve pain caused by muscle aches and stiffness, but only NSAIDs can also reduce inflammation (swelling and irritation). Acetaminophen and NSAIDs also work differently. NSAIDs relieve pain by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause pain. Acetaminophen works on the parts of the brain that receive the ""pain messages."" NSAIDs are also available in a prescription strength that can be prescribed by your physician. Using NSAIDs increase the risk of heart attack or stroke and have also been known to cause stomach ulcers and bleeding. They can also cause kidney problems."
484,What are some prescription pain relievers?,"Some examples of topical pain relievers include Aspercreme, Ben- Gay, Icy Hot, and Capzasin- P. Prescription pain relievers include: Corticosteroids Opioids Antidepressants Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Lidocaine patches Prescription corticosteroids provide relief for inflamed areas of the body by easing swelling, redness, itching and allergic reactions."
484,What are the side effects of using antidepressants for pain relief?,"In general, antidepressants have fewer long-term side effects than frequent, ongoing use of other pain medicines. Generally, SSRIs and SNRIs have fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants. The most common side effects with antidepressants include: Blurry vision Constipation Difficulty urinating Dry mouth Fatigue Nausea Headache Anticonvulsants are drugs typically used to treat seizure disorders."
484,Which antidepressants work best to treat pain?,"Chronic pain conditions treated by low-dose antidepressants include some types of headaches (like migraines) and menstrual pain. Some antidepressant medications include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) such as citalopram ( Celexa), fluoxetine ( Prozac), paroxetine ( Paxil), and sertraline ( Zoloft) Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, desipramine ( Norpramin), doxepin ( Silenor), imipramine ( Tofranil), and nortriptyline ( Pamelor) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) such as venlafaxine ( Effexor) and duloxetine ( Cymbalta) These drugs require a steady dose of the medicine buildup in the body over a period of time to work. The doses needed to treat pain are often lower than those needed to treat depression."
484,What are anticonvulsants?,"The most common side effects with antidepressants include: Blurry vision Constipation Difficulty urinating Dry mouth Fatigue Nausea Headache Anticonvulsants are drugs typically used to treat seizure disorders. Some of these medications are shown to be effective in treating pain as well. The exact way in which these medicines control pain is unclear but it is thought that they minimize the effects of nerves that cause pain. Some examples include carbamazepine ( Tegretol), gabapentin ( Neurontin), and pregabalin ( Lyrica)."
484,How do antidepressants treat pain relief?,"Side effects of opioids may include: Drowsiness Nausea Constipation Itching Breathing problems Addiction Antidepressants are drugs that can treat pain and/or emotional conditions by adjusting levels of neurotransmitters (natural chemicals) in the brain. These medications can increase the availability of the body's signals for well-being and relaxation, enabling pain control for some people with chronic pain conditions that do not completely respond to usual treatments. Research suggests antidepressants work best for neuropathic or nerve pain."
484,What are some topical pain relievers?,"Topical pain relievers are also available without a doctor's prescription. These products include creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin in order to relieve pain from sore muscles and arthritis. Some examples of topical pain relievers include Aspercreme, Ben- Gay, Icy Hot, and Capzasin- P. Prescription pain relievers include: Corticosteroids Opioids Antidepressants Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Lidocaine patches Prescription corticosteroids provide relief for inflamed areas of the body by easing swelling, redness, itching and allergic reactions."
484,What are the side effects of using anticonvulsants?,"Some of these medications are shown to be effective in treating pain as well. The most common side effects include: Drowsiness Dizziness Fatigue Nausea Another means of topical pain relief comes in the form of a lidocaine ( Lidoderm) patch, which is a prescription medication."
485,What is Apremilast (Otezla) and some of its side effects?,"Apremilast is a drug you take by mouth that's approved to treat psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis in adults. It curbs phosphodiesterase-4 ( PDE-4), an enzyme that controls inflammation. Side effects include diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Some people in studies who took the drug lost weight. If you use the medicine, it's recommended that you check your weight regularly and watch out for signs of depression."
485,What biologics are approved by the FDA to treat psoriasis?,"Biologic medicines approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe psoriasis include: Adalimumab ( Humira), a TNF-alpha-blocking antibody Adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), a biosimilar to Humira Brodalumab ( Siliq), a human antibody against interleukins Certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia), a TNF-alpha blocker Etanercept ( Enbrel), a TNF-alpha blocker Etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi), a biosimilar like Enbrel Guselkumab ( Tremfya), an antibody against interleukins Infliximab ( Remicade), a TNF-alpha blocker Ixekizumab ( Taltz), an antibody that binds to inflammation-causing proteins/interleukins Risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), an antibody against interleukins Secukinumab ( Cosentyx), a human antibody against interleukins Ustekinumab ( Stelara), a human antibody against interleukins Biologics are good at treating psoriasis."
485,How were past research treatments of psoriasis executed?,"Research in psoriasis doesn't always make headlines -- or win funding -- like discoveries in cancer or heart disease. And studies are hamstrung by the one-of-a-kind nature of your skin. Unlike many other diseases, experiments on mice or other animals aren't very helpful. In recent years, research into other autoimmune diseases brought new insights about the immune system. It turns out that some of the problems in those conditions are active in psoriasis, as well."
485,What do new psoriasis treatments look like?,"Research in psoriasis doesn't always make headlines -- or win funding -- like discoveries in cancer or heart disease. And studies are hamstrung by the one-of-a-kind nature of your skin. Unlike many other diseases, experiments on mice or other animals aren't very helpful. In recent years, research into other autoimmune diseases brought new insights about the immune system. It turns out that some of the problems in those conditions are active in psoriasis, as well. The new info brought treatments that target specific areas of your immune system. Called biologics, these drugs launched a new era of psoriasis treatment."
485,What were some of the older treatments for psoriasis compared to the newer treatments?,"In the 1960s and '70s, new info about how the immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- plays a role in psoriasis led to several new treatments.

486,What should I look for when I hire a hypnotherapist?,"Here are some tips when looking for a qualified hypnotherapist: Make sure they are licensed, trained, and credentialed. Ask about their professional training. The American Society for Clinical Hypnosis also suggests asking: â Is this practitioner able to help me without using hypnosis?"" If the answer is no, you should look elsewhere. Beware of too-good-to-be true claims or guarantees. Hypnosis does not work for everyone."

489,Do vestibular migraines cause symptoms of vertigo?,"If you're having a vestibular migraine, you may feel: Dizziness that lasts more than a few minutes Nausea and vomiting Balance problems Extreme motion sensitivity -- feeling sick or dizzy when you move your head, eyes, or body Feeling disoriented or confused Feeling unsteady, like you're in a rocking boat Sensitivity to sound You could get dizzy and have balance problems without having a migraine at all. Other times, the vertigo symptoms happen before, during, or after the headache. Sometimes, you might have migraines for years before the vertigo symptoms begin."
489,What drugs are used to treat vestibular migraines?,"CGRP inhibitors are a new class of preventive medicine that your doctor may recommend if other medicines don't help. If you have frequent or disabling vestibular migraines, your doctor may try drugs similar to traditional migraine meds."
489,What are other names for a vestibular migraine?,There are many names for this type of problem. Your doctor might also call it: Migraine-associated vertigo Migrainous vertigo Migraine-related vestibulopathy Vestibular migraines don't always cause headaches.
489,Is there a specific medication for vestibular migraines?,There's no specific medication for vestibular migraines. Your doctor will prescribe different drugs to stop an attack when it happens. This is called abortive therapy.
489,Who gets vestibular migraines?,"It's hard to tell how many people are living with this condition. The symptoms mimic a lot of other diseases. Researchers think they affect about 1% of the population. But that number could be higher. Like traditional migraines, they're more common in women than men. Vertigo symptoms tend to first strike around age 40. But the condition doesn't just affect adults. Kids can get it, too."
489,What causes vestibular migraines?,"Doctors aren't sure. Like migraines, there are a lot of theories. But how it really happens is poorly understood. They credit it to misfires between nerve cells in your brain."
489,Are vestibular suppressants used to treat vestibular migraines?,"It can ease your dizziness and motion sensitivity. This type of drug works on the balance center in your inner ear. Your doctor might prescribe benzodiazepines like lorazepam ( Ativan), anti-nausea drugs like promethazine ( Phenergan), and antihistamines like meclizine."
489,How are vestibular migraines diagnosed?,But the International Headache Society and other organizations recently set up the first criteria to help your doctor diagnose the disorder.
489,What are the symptoms of a vestibular migraine?,"Your doctor might also call it: Migraine-associated vertigo Migrainous vertigo Migraine-related vestibulopathy Vestibular migraines don't always cause headaches. The main symptom is dizziness that comes and goes. Vestibular refers to the inner ear, which controls your hearing and balance. If you're having a vestibular migraine, you may feel: Dizziness that lasts more than a few minutes Nausea and vomiting Balance problems Extreme motion sensitivity -- feeling sick or dizzy when you move your head, eyes, or body Feeling disoriented or confused Feeling unsteady, like you're in a rocking boat Sensitivity to sound You could get dizzy and have balance problems without having a migraine at all."
489,How does my doctor rule out something else with my vestibular migraine?,"At least half of the episodes happen with one of the following migraine symptoms: A headache that has two of these characteristics: is one-sided, pulsing, moderate to severe, or gets worse with activity Sensitivity to light or sound Seeing shimmering or flashing lights in your vision (a migraine aura) He'll likely order an MRI to check your brain and run hearing and balance tests to look for problems with your ears."
489,What signs are indicative of a vestibular migraine?,"If you're having a vestibular migraine, you may feel: Dizziness that lasts more than a few minutes Nausea and vomiting Balance problems Extreme motion sensitivity -- feeling sick or dizzy when you move your head, eyes, or body Feeling disoriented or confused Feeling unsteady, like you're in a rocking boat Sensitivity to sound You could get dizzy and have balance problems without having a migraine at all. You have at least 5 episodes of vertigo that make you feel like you are spinning or moving. This isn't the same as motion sickness or feeling faint. These feelings last between 5 minutes to 72 hours. Your symptoms are moderate to severe. That means they stop you from doing everyday tasks or they're so bad you can't do anything at all. At least half of the episodes happen with one of the following migraine symptoms: A headache that has two of these characteristics: is one-sided, pulsing, moderate to severe, or gets worse with activity Sensitivity to light or sound Seeing shimmering or flashing lights in your vision (a migraine aura) He'll likely order an MRI to check your brain and run hearing and balance tests to look for problems with your ears."
489,Can diet changes help prevent attacks of vestibular migraine?,"Your doctor might also call it: Migraine-associated vertigo Migrainous vertigo Migraine-related vestibulopathy Vestibular migraines don't always cause headaches. It's hard to tell how many people are living with this condition. If you have vestibular migraines, these things might trigger your symptoms, too. It can't hurt to cut them from your diet to see if your symptoms ease up a bit. Tracking your diet is another good way to help tell if your vertigo symptoms are really due to headaches. For example, a high-salt diet can make vertigo symptoms worse if you have Meniere's disease. Keep a food diary and show it to your doctor. It can help improve your diagnosis and treatment."
489,What is a vestibular migraine?,"Unlike traditional migraines, you may not always have a headache. You could be having a vestibular migraine if: You have migraines or had them in the past."
489,How are frequent or disabling vestibular migraines treated?,"If you have frequent or disabling vestibular migraines, your doctor may try drugs similar to traditional migraine prevention meds. You take these regularly to reduce the severity or frequency of the headaches. These include seizure medicines, blood pressure medicines (like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers), and some antidepressants. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of preventive medicine that your doctor may recommend if other medicines don't help. When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."

490,What medications treat Parkinson's disease?,Selegiline ( Eldepryl Zelapar) and rasagiline ( Azilect).
490,How does safinamide help with Parkinson's disease?,"Safinamide ( Xadago) is an add-on medicine that may be prescribed when individuals taking levdopoa and carbidopa have a breakthrough of Parkinson's symptoms that were previously under control. Studies show that adding this drug helps individuals experience longer times with reduced or no symptoms. The most common side effects are trouble falling or staying asleep, nausea, falls, and uncontrolled, involuntary movements."
490,How do dopamine agonists help with Parkinson's disease?,"They include ropinirole ( Requip), pramipexole ( Mirapex), and rotigotine ( Neupro). You can take one of these drugs on its own or along with Sinemet. Most doctors prescribe dopamine agonists first and then add levodopa if your symptoms still aren't under control. Dopamine agonists don't have the same risks of long-term problems as levodopa therapy."
490,How does Sinemet help with Parkinson's disease?,"Sinemet is a mix of levodopa and another drug called carbidopa. Carbidopa makes the levodopa work better, so you can take less of it. That prevents many common side effects of levodopa, such as nausea, vomiting, and irregular heart rhythms. Sinemet has the fewest short-term side effects, compared with other Parkinson's medications. But it does raise your odds for some long-term problems, such as involuntary movements."
490,Which drugs stop the breakdown of dopamine to treat Parkinson's disease?,"These drugs block the brain chemicals that break down dopamine. That helps your brain have more dopamine to work with. Some evidence shows that selegiline may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, especially early on."
490,What drugs might you take with levodopa for Parkinson's disease?,"Carbidopa makes the levodopa work better, so you can take less of it. Safinamide ( Xadago) is an add-on medicine that may be prescribed when individuals taking levdopoa and carbidopa have a breakthrough of Parkinson's symptoms that were previously under control. They include ropinirole ( Requip), pramipexole ( Mirapex), and rotigotine ( Neupro). You can take one of these drugs on its own or along with Sinemet. When you take levodopa, a chemical in your body called COMT makes part of the drug useless. The drugs tolcapone ( Tasmar) and entacapone ( Comtan) block COMT, so the brain can use levodopa more effectively, which eases Parkinson's symptoms."
490,How does levodopa help with Parkinson's disease?,"Most people can get relief from their Parkinson's symptoms with medicines. It's also the best at controlling the symptoms of the condition, particularly slow movements and stiff, rigid body parts. Levodopa works when your brain cells change it into dopamine. Sinemet is a mix of levodopa and another drug called carbidopa. A new, inhalable powder form of levopoda ( INBRIJA) has been approved for those experiencing OFF periods, OFF periods are when Parkinson's symptoms return during periods between scheduled doses of levodopa/carbidopa. These drugs act like dopamine in the brain. Have a routine for taking your medications."
491,What is Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Tumors with tiny new blood vessels grow below the surface of the skin and in membranes of your mouth, nose, eyes, and anus. It can spread to your lungs, liver, stomach, intestines, and lymph nodes, which are glands that help you fight infection. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. It affects 8 times more men than women. It may spread through sexual contact, but we don't know for sure. KS was once rare, affecting older men from Eastern European or Mediterranean families, young African men, or people who had undergone organ transplants. Now HIV is the most common cause."
491,What are life-threatening symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. The most visible signs of Kaposi's sarcoma are lesions on the skin: flat, painless spots that are red or purple on white skin and bluish, brownish, or black on dark skin. When KS spreads elsewhere, it can be life-threatening. You may have: Trouble eating or swallowing Queasiness, vomiting, and belly pain from bleeding and blockages inside Severe swelling in your arms, legs, face, or scrotum Serious coughing or shortness of breath Your doctor may diagnose Kaposi's sarcoma simply by looking at your skin."
491,What medications can treat Kaposi's sarcoma?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. Once KS has spread, you'll need meds that go throughout your whole body to kill the cancer. Another type of drug treatment, called biological therapy, works by boosting your immune system. Your doctor may prescribe interferon alfa ( Intron A) if your CD4 cell count is over 200 and you have a fairly healthy immune system. Targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibody therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs), are being tested in clinical trials. These try to attack the cancer and keep it from growing without harming healthy cells."
491,What is the most visible sign of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. The most visible signs of Kaposi's sarcoma are lesions on the skin: flat, painless spots that are red or purple on white skin and bluish, brownish, or black on dark skin. Unlike bruises, they don't turn white when you press on them. They aren't itchy, and they don't drain. They're not life-threatening. New spots may show up each week. For some people, these lesions change slowly. They may grow into raised bumps or grow together."
491,How is Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. Because people with HIV have weakened immune systems, they're more likely to develop certain cancers, including KS. Most severe cases happen when someone has AIDS, the late stage of HIV infection, but skin lesions can also show up earlier. In many cases, ART is the best way to treat active Kaposi's sarcoma. That won't cure you, but it can make your skin look better."
491,How is Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) treated?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. Your treatment will depend on how many lesions you have and how big they are and where they are, as well as how well your immune system is working. In many cases, ART is the best way to treat active Kaposi's sarcoma. It may even clear up the skin lesions. If you have just a few, you could have them removed. That won't cure you, but it can make your skin look better. Your doctor can cut the tissue out or freeze it to destroy it. Radiation can kill the cancer cells or keep them from growing. A machine can direct it toward the lesions on your body, or your doctor may put radioactive needles, seeds, or wires inside you near the cancer."
491,How is Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) diagnosed?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. You may have: Trouble eating or swallowing Queasiness, vomiting, and belly pain from bleeding and blockages inside Severe swelling in your arms, legs, face, or scrotum Serious coughing or shortness of breath Your doctor may diagnose Kaposi's sarcoma simply by looking at your skin. To confirm it, he may take a sample of tissue from a spot and look at it under a microscope, which is called a biopsy. If you have trouble breathing, your doctor may use a thin tube with a light (a bronchoscope) to look into your breathing passages. Or, if you have tummy troubles, he may want to look inside your guts through a lighted tube during a procedure called an endoscopy."
491,What are chemotherapy drugs for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)?,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. A machine can direct it toward the lesions on your body, or your doctor may put radioactive needles, seeds, or wires inside you near the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs for Kaposi's sarcoma include: Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin, Doxil) Paclitaxel ( Taxol) Vinblastine ( Velban) Chemotherapy can have side effects, including hair loss, vomiting, and fatigue."
492,What is retinis pigmentosa?,"Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP) is a term for a group of eye diseases that can lead to loss of sight. What they have in common is a coloring your doctor sees when he looks at your retina -- a bundle of tissue at the back of your eye. When you have RP, cells in the retina called photoreceptors don't work the way they're supposed to, and over time, you lose your sight. It's a rare disorder that's passed from parent to child. Only 1 out of every 4,000 people get it. About half of all people with RP have a family member who also has it."
492,What are the differences between rods and cones?,"The retina has two types of cells that gather light: rods and cones. The rods are around the outer ring of the retina and are active in dim light. Most forms of retinitis pigmentosa affect the rods first. Your night vision and your ability to see to the side -- peripheral vision -- go away. Cones are mostly in the center of your retina. They help you see color and fine detail. When RP affects them, you slowly lose your central vision and your ability to see color."
492,What are the treatment options for retinitis pigmentosa?,"A few options can slow your vision loss and may even restore some sight: Acetazolamide: In the later stages, the tiny area at the center of your retina can swell. This is called macular edema, and it, too, can reduce your vision. This medication can ease swelling and improve your vision. Vitamin A palmitate: High doses of this compound may slow retinitis pigmentosa a little each year. But you have to be careful, because too much can be toxic. Work closely with your doctor and follow her recommendations. Sunglasses: These make your eyes less sensitive to light and protect your eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays that may speed vision loss. Retinal implant: If you have late-stage RP, you may be a candidate a retinal implant that could provide partial sight. Argus II is the implant available in the US. It's implanted into a single eye and paired with glasses equipped with a camera. Images are converted to electrical pulses that are sent to the retina. Many were able to locate lights and windows. Some were able to determine where other people were located in a room and about half of the subjects were able to read letter that were about 9 inches high. Other treatments under review include: Replacement of damaged cells or tissues with healthy ones Gene therapy to put healthy genes into the retina Devices and tools can help you make the most of your vision, and rehab services can help you stay independent."
492,How does an eye doctor diagnose retinitis pigmentosa?,"He'll look into your eyes and do some special tests: Ophthalmoscope: The doctor will put drops into your eyes to make your pupil wider to get a better look at your retina. He will use a handheld tool to look into the back of your eye. If you have RP, there will be specific kinds of dark spots on your retina. Visual field test: You'll look through a tabletop machine at a point in the center of your vision. While staring at that point, objects or lights will appear to the side. You'll press a button when you see them, and the machine will create a map of how far to the side you can see. Electroretinogram: The eye doctor will put a film of gold foil or a special contact lens on your eye. Then he will measure how your retina responds to flashes of light. Genetic test: You'll submit a DNA sample to find out which form of RP you have. If you or anyone in your family is diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, all family members should go to the eye doctor for screening."
492,What causes retinitis pigmentosa?,"More than 60 different genes can cause the different types of retinitis pigmentosa. Parents can pass the problem genes on to their children in three different ways: Autosomal recessive RP: Each parent has one problem copy and one normal copy of the gene that's responsible, but they don't have any symptoms. A child that inherits two problem copies of the gene (one from each parent) will develop this type of retinitis pigmentosa. Since two copies of the problem gene are needed, each child in the family has a 25% chance of being affected. Autosomal dominant RP: This type of retinitis pigmentosa requires only one copy of the problem gene to develop. A parent with that gene has a 50% chance of passing it to each child. X-linked RP: A mother who carries the problem gene can pass it down to her children. Each one of them has a 50% chance of getting it. Most women who carry the gene won't have any symptoms. But about 1 out of every 5 will have mild symptoms. Most men who get it will have more severe cases. Fathers who have the gene can't pass it to their children."
492,What are the symptoms of retinis pigmentosa?,"Because rods are usually affected first, the first symptom you may notice is that it takes longer to adjust to darkness (called ânight blindness). You may lose your peripheral vision at the same time or soon after your night vision declines. You may get ""tunnel vision,"" which means you can't see things to the side without turning your head. In later stages, your cones may be affected. That will make it harder for you to do detail work, and you may have trouble seeing colors. It's rare, but sometimes the cones die first. You might find bright lights uncomfortable -- a symptom your doctor may call photophobia. You also may start to see flashes of light that shimmer or blink. This is called photopsia."
493,How can the doctor accurately diagnose prostate cancer?,Your doctor is likely to discuss your medical history with you. Answering questions about any history of genital or urinary disease in your family can help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor may also ask about any changes in your pattern of urinating.
493,Why are these prostate cancer tests not completely accurate?,"Neither of these initial tests for prostate cancer is perfect. Many men with a mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and men with prostate cancer may have normal levels of PSA. Also, the digital rectal exam does not detect all prostate cancers, as it can only assess the back portion of the prostate gland."
494,What medications are used to treat vertigo?,"In some cases, medication may be given to relieve symptoms such as nausea or motion sickness associated with vertigo. If vertigo is caused by an infection or inflammation, antibiotics or steroids may reduce swelling and cure infection. For Meniere's disease, diuretics (water pills) may be prescribed to reduce pressure from fluid buildup."
494,How do you know if your vertigo is caused by vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis?,This is an inner ear problem usually related to infection (usually viral). The infection causes inflammation in the inner ear around nerves that are important for helping the body sense balance Less often vertigo may be associated with: Head or neck injury Brain problems such as stroke or tumor Certain medications that cause ear damage Migraine headaches Vertigo is often triggered by a change in the position of your head.
494,How is vertigo treated by canalith repositioning maneuvers?,Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend a series of specific head and body movements for BPPV. The movements are done to move the calcium deposits out of the canal into an inner ear chamber so they can be absorbed by the body. You will likely have vertigo symptoms during the procedure as the canaliths move. A doctor or physical therapist can guide you through the movements.
494,How do you know if your vertigo is caused by Meniere's disease?,This is an inner ear disorder thought to be caused by a buildup of fluid and changing pressure in the ear. It can cause episodes of vertigo along with ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss.
494,What is vertigo associated with?,The infection causes inflammation in the inner ear around nerves that are important for helping the body sense balance Less often vertigo may be associated with: Head or neck injury Brain problems such as stroke or tumor Certain medications that cause ear damage Migraine headaches Vertigo is often triggered by a change in the position of your head.
494,How is surgery used to treat vertigo?,"In a few cases, surgery may be needed for vertigo. If vertigo is caused by a more serious underlying problem, such as a tumor or injury to the brain or neck, treatment for those problems may help to alleviate the vertigo."
495,How should I eat if I have dumping syndrome?,"Here are some other ways to lessen symptoms of dumping syndrome: Eat five or six small meals or snacks a day. Keep portions small, such as 1 ounce of meat or 1/4 cup of vegetables. Cut food into very small pieces. Chew well before swallowing. Combine proteins or fats along with fruits or starches. ( For example, combine fruit with cottage cheese.) Stop eating when you first begin to feel full. Drink liquids 30 to 45 minutes after meals. Reclining after eating may help prevent light-headedness."
496,What blood thinners are used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"Blood thinners include: Apixaban ( Eliquis) Betrixaban ( BEVYXXA) Dabigatran ( Pradaxa) Edoxaban ( Savaysa) Fondaparinux ( Arixtra) Heparin Rivaroxaban ( Xarelto) Warfarin ( Coumadin) In the hospital, your doctor may give you heparin at first, by a needle into your vein or as a shot."
496,How effective Is clot-busting medicine for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"Your doctor may recommend a clot-busting medicine called a thrombolytic agent if you: Have large clots causing pain, swelling, and problems with circulation Are at high risk for a pulmonary embolism Have DVT in your arm, rather than your leg This procedure quickly breaks up a clot and restores blood flow. It may also save the valves in that vein. But it's riskier than taking blood thinners. You have a greater chance of bleeding problems and stroke."
496,When is surgery done for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"When taking blood thinners or clot-busting isn't possible or doesn't work well, your doctor may want to try a more involved procedure."
496,How are blood thinners used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"These drugs, also called anticoagulants, are the most common treatment for DVT. They can keep a clot from growing or breaking off, and they prevent new clots from forming. But they can't thin your blood, despite their name, or dissolve an existing clot."
496,How is dabigatran used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,Dabigatran is a pill that stops a specific protein that helps your blood clot from working. That's why it's called a direct thrombin inhibitor.
496,What will treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) do for you?,"Treatment prevents future blood clots, too. They can keep a clot from growing or breaking off, and they prevent new clots from forming. Your doctor may recommend a clot-busting medicine called a thrombolytic agent if you: Have large clots causing pain, swelling, and problems with circulation Are at high risk for a pulmonary embolism Have DVT in your arm, rather than your leg This procedure quickly breaks up a clot and restores blood flow. In very rare cases, you may need to have a deep vein clot cut out."
496,How do you know what treatment works best to treat your deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"What will treating DVT, a blood clot deep in a vein, do for you? But you may need surgery. Talk to your doctor about which medical treatment options are right for you."
496,How does warfarin (Coumadin) treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"When you take heparin by IV, you'll need blood tests, too. While you take it, you'll need regular blood tests to make sure you've got the right amount in your system -- too little won't prevent clots, too much makes dangerous bleeding more likely. It can also interact with other medicines, vitamins, and foods with a lot of vitamin K, which is another good reason to get your blood checked often. Let your doctor know if you're pregnant, because warfarin can cause birth defects. You'll have to take something else."
496,When is a venous thrombectomy used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"What will treating DVT, a blood clot deep in a vein, do for you? Venous thrombectomy. A severe type of DVT, called phlegmasia cerulea dolens, doesn't respond well to other kinds of treatment."
497,What are sources of insoluble fiber?,"You find soluble fiber in foods such as: Oats Peas Beans Apples Citrus fruits Carrots Barley Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, is found in things like: Whole-wheat flour Wheat bran Nuts Beans Cauliflower Green beans Potatoes Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help. Examples of supplements include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly to help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake."
497,How much water should you drink if you have irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea?,"As long as your doctor has not restricted your fluids, shoot for six to eight 8-ounce glasses of plain H2 O each day, but not always with meals. "" Water just makes everything run through a little more rapidly,"" Bonci says. She suggests you drink it an hour before or an hour after meals."
497,Does how I eat affect my irritable bowel syndrome?,"How you eat may also give you trouble. You might be bothered by foods with extreme temperatures, especially if you have them together, like ice-cold water with steaming hot soup. Many people get symptoms after large meals. Try to eat less at each meal, or have four or five small meals a day. Remember, your reactions to what you eat are unique, Bonci says."
497,Which foods have insoluble fiber?,"You find soluble fiber in foods such as: Oats Peas Beans Apples Citrus fruits Carrots Barley Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, is found in things like: Whole-wheat flour Wheat bran Nuts Beans Cauliflower Green beans Potatoes Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help."
497,"If I have IBS, does it matter what I eat?","Smart eating habits can make your life a little easier when you have irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, or IBS- D. And you don't have to completely give up any foods you like. "" Moderation is important,"" says Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, author of the American Dietetic Association ( ADA) Guide to Better Digestion. It's important to stick to a balanced diet when you have IBS. So never totally avoid certain groups of food, or you may be depriving yourself of nutrients you need."
497,Should I eat less fiber if I have IBS-D?,"Don't avoid fiber if you have diarrhea. It helps protect your body against heart disease, by lowering your LDL cholesterol, and certain cancers, so you need it. Simply eat more soluble fiber, rather than the insoluble kind, Bonci says. Soluble fiber stays in the gut longer, which helps the colon work normally.

498,How can I tell the difference between a cold and allergies?,They have different causes. You get a cold when a tiny living thing called a virus gets into your body. There are hundreds of different types that can get you sick.
498,What is the difference between the duration of a cold vs. allergies?,"Characteristic Cold Allergy How Long It Lasts 3-14 days Days to months -- as long as you're in contact with the allergy trigger and a short time after When It Happens Most often in the winter, but possible at any time Any time of the year -- although the appearance of some allergy triggers is seasonal When It Starts Symptoms take a few days to appear after infection with the virus Symptoms can begin immediately after contact with allergy triggers Symptom Cold Allergy Cough Often Sometimes Aches Sometimes Never Fatigue Sometimes Sometimes Fever Rarely Never Itchy, watery eyes Rarely Often Sore throat Often Sometimes Runny or stuffy nose Often Often The most important difference is that colds usually don't last longer than 14 days. So see your doctor if you still have symptoms after 2 weeks. These may be allergy symptoms or signs of another problem."
498,Are allergies contagious?,The viruses that cause colds are contagious.
498,What causes allergies?,"They're caused by an overactive immune system. For some reason, your body mistakes harmless things, such as dust or pollen, for germs and mounts an attack on them. When that happens, your body releases chemicals such as histamine, just as it does when fighting a cold. This can cause a swelling in the passageways of your nose, and you'll start sneezing and coughing."
498,Are cold viruses contagious?,"The viruses that cause colds are contagious. You can pick them up when someone who's infected sneezes, coughs, or shakes hands with you. After a couple of weeks, at the most, your immune system fights off the illness and you should stop having symptoms."
498,What causes cold symptoms?,"You get a cold when a tiny living thing called a virus gets into your body. This can cause a swelling in the passageways of your nose, and you'll start sneezing and coughing."
499,"What are challenges for older people who need treatment for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and how can they be handled?","But because older people are often diagnosed later, the disease may have had time to do more damage to the immune system. After you've tested positive, even if you don't feel any different, it's important to find an HIV doctor right away. Because of your age, your treatment plan may involve several health care providers to treat a range of physical and mental needs. HIV raises your odds of age-related health problems, including heart disease, thin bones, dementia and certain cancers. To stay healthy, you'll need to take care of yourself. Exercise regularly, keep a healthy weight, eat well, and quit smoking."
499,"What are the symptoms of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and how can they be different in older people?","The symptoms of HIV can be mistaken for the regular process of aging. Some people may not see any symptoms at first, while others may feel like they have the flu a few weeks after they're infected, with: Cough Diarrhea Fever Headache Sweats It can take as long as 10 years for other symptoms to show up, such as: Weight loss Swollen glands Little energy Loss of appetite Skin rashes, sores in your mouth or genital area, or repeated yeast infections Gut cramps Short-term memory loss If you think you could have HIV, talk to your doctor."
499,What problems can depression cause in older people who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"So they feel more alone. Depression in older people can also look like memory problems, general complaints about pain, and seeing or hearing things. And when you're depressed, you may not care as much about sticking to your treatment. Let your doctor know if you've been struggling for more than a couple of weeks. Treating depression can help you feel better mentally and physically."
499,"What should I do if I think I have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and where can I get tested?","An early diagnosis means you can start treatment and prevent the disease from becoming AIDS. You could get tested at your doctor's office or a clinic, hospital, or community health center, and it's often free. A diagnosis of HIV could make it even harder to talk to people you care about, if you're worried about what they might think or say about you."
500,What are short-acting medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?,"They include: Amphetamines: Mixed amphetamine salts ( Adderall, Evekeo) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine, Pro Centra) Methylphenidates: Dexmethylphenidate SR ( Focalin) Methylphenidate immediate release ( Ritalin, Methylin) This kind of medicine helps if you need to focus for just a few hours. Perhaps you're working on spreadsheets or writing a report and need to be sharp. A short-acting med peaks and falls in your bloodstream quickly. You might feel irritable when it wears off. That's called a rebound effect. If you want to control symptoms all day, you'll need to pop more than one pill. That can be inconvenient and hard to remember to do when you're busy."
501,What are the symptoms of thrombocytopenia?,"Sometimes you don't have any symptoms from thrombocytopenia. When you do, the main one is bleeding in the skin that look like tiny red or purple spots on the skin, called petechiae, or bruising. You can bleed outside or inside your body. Sometimes it can be heavy or hard to stop. Some people get nosebleeds or bleeding gums. You might also have: Blood in your urine or bowel movement Heavy menstrual periods These symptoms might not start until your platelet count is very low. If you notice any of them, call your doctor."
501,What factors lead to thrombocytopenia?,"Your body can destroy too many platelets by: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP), where your own body attacks healthy cells Medicines, such as antibiotics that contain sulfa, heparin used to prevent blood clots, and antiseizure drugs such as phenytoin ( Dilantin) and vancomycin ( Vancocin) Rare diseases that make blood clots form in the body, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC) Viruses like Epstein- Barr virus ( EBV), hepatitis C, and HIV Sometimes, you don't have enough platelets because they get trapped in your spleen, an organ that fights infection. And women may get thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, because their bodies get rid of platelets more quickly than usual."
501,How is thrombocytopenia diagnosed?,"You'll also get an exam to look for bruises, petechiae or spots of blood in your skin, and other signs of low platelets. You'll be checked for signs of infection, like a fever or rash. You might get a blood test that measures the number of platelets. A normal count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. You can have bleeding problems if your count drops below 50,000. Your doctor will most likely consult with a blood specialist (hematologist). You might get other tests, including: Blood smear to look at your platelets under a microscope and see how healthy they are Bone marrow test to see what cells are in the bone marrow, how full the bone marrow is with cells, and whether they are normall Your doctor might want you to take other tests that check if your blood clots normally."
501,How can you prevent bleeding if you have thrombocytopenia?,"To prevent bleeding when your platelets are low: Avoid medicines that can affect your platelet function, like aspirin and ibuprofen Limit how much alcohol you drink, because it can make bleeding worse. Don't play contact sports, like football or boxing, where you might get injured. Use a soft toothbrush to prevent bleeding gums. Wear a seatbelt in the car, and put on gloves and goggles when you work with power tools to prevent injury."
501,How is thrombocytopenia treated?,"You might also have: Blood in your urine or bowel movement Heavy menstrual periods These symptoms might not start until your platelet count is very low. You won't bleed too much, even if you get cut. Sometimes your platelet count will go up when you avoid the cause of the problem. For instance, if taking a certain medicine is behind your thrombocytopenia, your doctor will have you stop that drug. For severe thrombocytopenia, you might get: Steroid medicines to stop your body from destroying platelets if the cause is related to your immune system. Blood or platelets from a healthy person, called a transfusion Surgery to remove your spleen If your condition is ongoing despite other treatments, your doctor may prescribe medicines such as romiplostim ( Nplate) and eltrombopag ( Promacta, Revolade)."
501,What causes thrombocytopenia?,"You can get thrombocytopenia if your body doesn't make enough of them, or if they're destroyed faster than they can be made. Your body might not make enough platelets if you have a: Blood disorder that affects bone marrow, called aplastic anemia Cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma, which damages your bone marrow Platelet-lowering disease that runs in your family, like Wiskott- Aldrich or May- Hegglin syndrome Virus such as chickenpox, mumps, rubella, HIV, or Epstein- Barr Aplastic anemia Chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer destroys stem cells that form platelets. If you've been in contact with chemicals like pesticides and arsenic, your body might slow down the process of making platelets. You might get other tests, including: Blood smear to look at your platelets under a microscope and see how healthy they are Bone marrow test to see what cells are in the bone marrow, how full the bone marrow is with cells, and whether they are normall Your doctor might want you to take other tests that check if your blood clots normally."
501,What is thrombocytopenia?,"It might not cause you any health problems at all. But if you do have symptoms like bleeding too much, treatments can help. Sometimes you don't have any symptoms from thrombocytopenia."
502,What are seasonal allergies like?,"Common triggers include: Pollen Grass Weeds Dust Pet dander If you have seasonal allergies, you generally have symptoms for a short time. You may be bothered in the spring by tree pollen, in the summer by grass pollen, or in the fall by weed pollen. The symptoms tend to clear up during other times of the year, especially in the winter."
502,How can I treat the symptoms of my eye allergies at home?,"If that's the case for you, these at-home treatments may give you some relief: Apply cool compresses to your eyes to ease the allergic reaction. Use artificial tears or lubricating eye drops. Use over-the-counter medications , like allergy eye drops and oral antihistamines for mild allergies. Try not to rub your eyes, since that can make your symptoms worse."
502,Are there over-the-counter treatments for eye allergies?,"Lots of over-the-counter meds, like allergy or antihistamine eye drops as well as antihistamines you take by mouth, can help against mild allergies. Follow the directions on the packages exactly."
502,How often should I see my doctor for my eye allergies?,"Some common corticosteroids used for eye allergies are: Fluorometholone ( FML, FML Forte, FML Liquifilm) Loteprednol 0.02% ( Alrex) Loteprednol 0.05% ( Lotemax) Medrysone ( HMS) Prednisolone ( AK- Pred) Rimexolone ( Vexol) For mild cases of seasonal or perennial allergies, annual follow-up visits with your eye doctor are a good idea. You may need to go more often for a severe case."
503,How can hyperthyroidism affect your metabolism?,"When you first get hyperthyroidism, you may feel very energetic. This is because your metabolism is sped up. But over time, this increase in your metabolism can break your body down, and cause you to feel tired."
503,How do I know if I have hyperthyroidism?,"Some common signs include: Feeling nervous, anxious, or irritable Experiencing mood swings Feeling very tired or weak Sensitivity to heat An enlarged thyroid (goiter). This can make the base of your neck look swollen. Losing weight suddenly with no known cause Fast or irregular heartbeat or palpitations (pounding in your heart) Increased frequency in your bowel movements Shaking in your hands and fingers (tremor) Sleep problems Thinning skin Changes in your hair that make it fine and brittle Changes in your menstrual cycle These are less likely to show up if you're an older adult, but sometimes there will be subtle symptoms."
504,When should you call your doctor about loss of bladder or bowel control due to back pain?,"Loss of bladder or bowel control: If you have back pain and suddenly can't control your bladder or bowels, call your doctor right away. This could be a sign of several things, like spinal tumors or cauda equina syndrome, a rare but serious condition caused by a severe compression of the nerve roots in the spine. It could also signal lumbar spinal stenosis, which causes compression of the nerves in the lower back."
504,Should you call your doctor if you have a fever and back pain?,"Fever: When you have a high temperature and back pain, take it seriously. It could be the sign of a spinal infection, which needs urgent medical attention."
504,Should you call your doctor about radiating back pain?,"Radiating pain: Low back strains and sprains, sciatica, and a herniated disk can cause back pain to âradiateâ -- move to other parts of your body. If it's causing aching, numbness or tingling in your butt, genitals, legs, feet, arms or hands, see your doctor. He'll be able to find out why and give you something to ease your symptoms."
505,When is burping a problem?,"Burping as many as four times after a meal is normal. But some illnesses can make you burp a lot more than that: Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD), sometimes called acid reflux, happens when acid in your stomach flows back into your esophagus and causes heartburn. If you have this only occasionally, you can treat it with over-the-counter medicines. But if you have it a lot, you may need to make changes in your diet or take prescription drugs. Indigestion, also called dyspepsia, causes pain or discomfort in your upper belly. It can come with belching, bloating, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting. Gastritis happens when the lining of your stomach is irritated. Helicobacter pylori is a kind of bacteria that can cause an infection in your stomach and lead to ulcers. Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS) can also cause belly cramps, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation."
505,Why am I burping?,"But if it happens often, it can be a sign of a health problem. If you burp a lot, it's probably time to find out why."
505,When are you most likely to burp?,You're more likely to swallow air and burp if you: Chew gum Smoke Eat too quickly Suck on hard candies Have dentures that don't fit right Foods with a lot of fat or oil in them can cause heartburn. This also can make you burp. So can drinks with caffeine or alcohol.
505,How can I stop burping?,"If you're concerned about how much you burp, talk with your doctor. She might have some suggestions to help keep it from happening. She also may run tests to look for signs of a health problem. If no medical issue is causing you to burp, you might try some of these: Eat or drink more slowly. You're less likely to swallow air. Don't eat things like broccoli, cabbage, beans, or dairy products. They can lead to gas in your stomach or intestines and make you burp. Stay away from soda and beer. Don't chew gum. Stop smoking. Your doctor will give you lots of reasons to do this, but it also can help cut down on how much you burp. Take a walk after eating. A bit of exercise can help your digestion. Take an antacid."
505,Why do people burp?,"There your body uses acid, bacteria, and chemicals called enzymes to break it down into nutrients it uses for energy. If you swallow air along with your food or if you drink something like a soda or beer that has bubbles in it, those gases can come back up through your esophagus. That's a burp."
506,How does haptoglobin work?,"Your liver makes haptoglobin, and it's found in your plasma, the watery part of the blood. It's an antioxidant. That means it protects your body from damage caused by certain chemical reactions. Your body makes more when you have an injury, infection, or inflammation. Hemoglobin is what carries iron in red blood cells. When these cells reach the end of their natural lifespan, they break down, and what's left goes into your bloodstream. That loose hemoglobin can damage your blood vessels. Haptoglobin's job is to soak up loose hemoglobin molecules before they make trouble."
506,How can you find out what kind of haptoglobin you have?,A DNA test is the only way to find out what kind of haptoglobin you have. Ask your doctor whether you should get tested.
506,How do genes affect how protective haptoglobin is?,"A certain gene controls haptoglobin, and it has two versions. You get one gene from each parent. So your pair of haptoglobin genes could be both version 1, both version 2, or one of each. Your particular combination is called your genotype. Problems come when you have diabetes and 2-2 (version 2 from both your parents). 2-2 haptoglobin doesn't get rid of hemoglobin molecules as well as the other types do. Among other problems, that seems to keep âgoodâ cholesterol from doing what it should to lower your overall cholesterol level."
506,How can you prevent heart problems if you know you are at a higher risk for heart complications of diabetes?,"If you have diabetes, there's a higher chance that you could have many other health problems, like heart disease and high blood pressure. Get to a healthy weight. Exercise most days. Eat less saturated fat, cholesterol, and salt. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."
506,What does haptoglobin do for people with diabetes?,"But whether it works like it should depends on your DNA, or genes. Several studies have looked at why some people with diabetes have heart and artery problems and others don't. It appears that the kind of haptoglobin you have has a lot to do with it. Your liver makes haptoglobin, and it's found in your plasma, the watery part of the blood. If you know you're more likely to have problems with your heart and your blood vessels, you can manage the other things that cause them, like your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol."
507,What is melanoma like in people with dark skin?,"Although dark-skinned people have a natural protection against skin cancer, that doesn't mean it can't occur. It does -- most frequently where skin is lightest, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and around the nail bed. This is most true for Asians, Native Americans, and people of African descent. In Hispanics, melanoma occurs most frequently on the legs. Because it is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), tinea manuum (a fungus occurring on the palms of the hands), or a condition known as talon noir or black heel, and because many people do not seek treatment early on, the melanoma death rate is highest among people with dark skin. The lifesaving answer lies in awareness and early diagnosis."
507,What should you know about skin conditions in dark skin?,"Skin problems, however, are generally color-blind, meaning that most skin conditions can occur in every race and in all skin types. That said, there are certain skin conditions that seem to affect dark skin more frequently or with more severity. Further, many treatments used for common skin conditions can sometimes lead to even more problems when used on people of color. But before you can learn how to protect your face and body, it's important to know a little something about the biology of dark skin."
507,What is pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) like for people with dark skin?,"This skin condition is characterized by bumps under the surface of the skin, and is often confused with acne. But the problem actually stems from ingrown hairs. It most often occurs in black and Hispanic people, due to the distinct shape of the hair follicle. If the bumps are squeezed or manipulated in any way, they can become inflamed or infected. But even when left alone, they can be difficult to cover and sometimes cause pain. Recent studies have shown that laser hair removal is an effective treatment. Because this condition is often confused with acne, it's important to have your diagnosis confirmed by a dermatologist familiar with dark skin."
507,Who is at greatest risk for pigmentation problems?,"Those with sensitive skin are at greatest risk for pigmentation problems. In fact, any skin care product ingredient that irritates or dries skin increases the risk."
507,What are keloids like in people with dark skin?,"Acne develops when there is an overproduction of oil in the skin. The most common locations are the earlobes, chest, back, and arms. While they can develop immediately after an injury, they can also take months or even years to grow -- and they can continue growing over a period of time. In some people, keloids may itch, cause pain and burning, and be tender to the touch. Though no one is certain why keloids develop, they are thought to be linked to a defect in collagen production. Treatments include cortisone injections, radiation therapy, pressure dressings, and silicone gel applications. Keloids can also be removed via surgery or with a laser. Regardless of the treatment, keloids return between 45% and 100% of the time."
508,What is an electrophysiology (EP) study?,"An electrophysiology ( EP) study is a test that records the electrical activity and the electrical pathways of your heart. This test is used to help determine the cause of your heart rhythm disturbance and the best treatment for you. During the EP study, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which one controls it best or to determine the best procedure or device to treat your heart rhythm."
508,What can I expect during an electrophysiology (EP) study?,"An electrophysiology study is used: To determine the cause of an abnormal heart rhythm To decide the best treatment for an abnormal heart rhythm Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Before an electrophysiology study, you will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous ( IV) line into your arm or hand. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The skin at the top of both of your legs will be shaved and cleansed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes are used to cover you, from your neck to your feet. A soft strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field."
508,How long does the electrophysiology (EP) study take?,"An electrophysiology study is used: To determine the cause of an abnormal heart rhythm To decide the best treatment for an abnormal heart rhythm Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. The EP study takes about two to four hours to perform. However, it can take longer if additional treatments such as catheter ablation are performed at the same time."
508,How should I prepare for an electrophysiology (EP) study?,"An electrophysiology study is used: To determine the cause of an abnormal heart rhythm To decide the best treatment for an abnormal heart rhythm Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain medications one to five days before your EP study. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the EP study. If you must take medications, take them only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. If you are able to go home, bring a companion to drive you home."

An electrophysiology study is used: To determine the cause of an abnormal heart rhythm To decide the best treatment for an abnormal heart rhythm Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. The skin at the top of both of your legs will be shaved and cleansed with an antiseptic solution. The catheters sense the electrical activity in your heart and are used to evaluate your heart's conduction system. The doctor will use a pacemaker to deliver the electrical impulses through one of the catheters to increase your heart rate.
509,What happens when you're exposed to the virus that causes cold sores?,"When you're first exposed to the virus, you're likely to get a cold sore. After a week or two, it'll go away on its own. Then the virus goes dormant in your body. You may never have another cold sore outbreak again, but many people do."
509,How do you spread the virus that causes cold sores?,"Herpes simplex is spread by close contact. If you kiss someone with a cold sore, or you touch his face and then touch your own face, you can catch the virus. You can also get herpes simplex by sharing lip balm, a fork, a mug or a razor with someone who has it. You're most likely to get the virus from someone who has an active cold sore, but it's also possible to contract it from someone who doesn't have a sore or blister showing."
509,What are things that bring on cold sores?,"Some things that make an outbreak more likely are: A cold or other illness A fever Stress Too much sun Your period There are many that you can do at home to soothe the sting of a cold sore, such as: Ice."
509,Can aloe vera gel treat cold sores?,The same gel used for sunburn may help a cold sore to heal.
509,Can the virus that causes cold sores affect other body parts?,"The virus also can spread to the eyes or the genitals. For example, if you rub your eyes after getting saliva from an infected person on your hands, or if you receive oral sex from someone who has cold sores. Don't touch. If you pick your cold sore, you may spread the virus to another part of your body. That will just make your outbreak worse.

510,What are some signs of processing issues in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"That's because some researchers estimate that eight out of 10 children with autism have problems processing sensory input. For example, they can't filter out background noise. Other signs of processing issues include: Problems with balance Problems with body position in space Oversensitivity to touch and the feel of certain types of clothing, such as socks with seams With autism, social, behavioral, or attention problems can be partly a result of these sensory challenges."
510,What kinds of things does an occupational look at to help evaluate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children?,"The therapist observes children to see if they can do tasks they are expected to do at their ages -- getting dressed or playing a game, for example. Sometimes, the therapist will have the child videotaped during the day in order to see how the child interacts with his or her environment so that he or she can better assess the kind of care the child needs. The therapist might note any of the following: Attention span and stamina Transition to new activities Play skills Need for personal space Responses to touch or other types of stimuli Motor skills such as posture, balance, or manipulation of small objects Aggression or other types of behaviors Interactions between the child and caregivers Once an occupational therapist has gathered information, he or she can develop a program for your child."

511,When should I get surgery for a deviated septum?,"If possible, it is best to wait until after the nose has stopped growing, around age 15, to have surgery."
511,When should I see a doctor about a deviated septum?,"Although rare, risks of septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty may include: Infection Bleeding Hole (perforation) of the septum Loss of the ability to smell If you are having nasal symptoms and think you may have a deviated septum, make an appointment to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT. There are a number of reasons why you may be experiencing these symptoms, including chronic sinusitis or nasal allergies. Make sure you get the right diagnosis so that you can get the treatment you need."

Most people have some sort of imbalance in the size of their breathing passages. In fact, estimates indicate that 80% of people, most unknowingly, have some sort of misalignment to their nasal septum. Only the more severe imbalances cause significant breathing problems and require treatment."
511,What causes a deviated septum?,Some people are born with a deviated septum. Other people develop a deviated septum after injury or trauma to the nose.
511,How is a deviated septum treated?,"Sometimes symptoms of a deviated septum can be relieved with medications. If medicine alone doesn't offer adequate relief, a surgical procedure called septoplasty may be needed to repair a crooked septum and improve breathing."
511,How does surgery treat a deviated septum?,"Sometimes, a rhinoplasty, or ""nose job,"" is combined with septoplasty to improve the appearance of the nose. This procedure is called septorhinoplasty. Septoplasty may also be combined with sinus surgery. Surgery to repair a deviated septum is usually performed in an outpatient setting under local or general anesthesia and takes about one to one and a half hours, depending on the amount of work being done. You should be able to go home three to four hours after surgery. Internal splints or soft packing material may be put in the nose to stabilize the septum as it heals. If a septoplasty is the only procedure performed, there should be little to no swelling or bruising after surgery. However, if a septorhinoplasty is performed, a week or two of swelling and bruising is normal following the procedure."
511,What are the symptoms of a deviated septum?,"The most common symptom of a deviated septum is nasal congestion, with one side of the nose being more congested than the other, along with difficulty breathing. Recurrent or repeated sinus infections can also be a sign of a deviated septum. Other symptoms include frequent: Nosebleeds Facial pain Headache Postnasal drip Loud breathing and snoring during sleep A deviated septum may also cause sleep apnea, a serious condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep."
511,What newer procedures treat a deviated septum?,"These are being done for milder cases. No surgery is completely risk-free, and the benefits of undergoing surgery -- in this case, being able to breathe better -- must outweigh the risks. Septoplasty and septorhinoplasty are common and safe procedures; side effects are rare."

519,What happens during a B-type natriuretic peptide blood test?,"A small amount of blood will be taken from you. Then it's placed in a machine that reads the level of BNP and NT-pro- BNP. The test takes about 15 minutes. In some places, the blood sample needs to be sent away to a lab to be tested."
519,Why is a B-type natriuretic peptide  blood test needed?,"BNP levels help your doctor figure out if you have heart failure or something else that has similar symptoms such as shortness of breath. The test also shows if your heart failure has worsened. It'll help your doctor decide what treatments you need and if you need to be hospitalized. It may also give him a look into what the future may hold. It is a sensitive test to allow the doctor to evaluate improvement or worsening of heart failure and to help monitor whether or not the medication is working well. Depending on your medical center, you may get tested for one or both proteins."
