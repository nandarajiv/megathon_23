0,"Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle). Heart failure does not mean the heart has stopped working. Rather, it means that the heart's pumping power is weaker than normal or the heart has become less elastic. With heart failure, blood moves through the heart's pumping chambers less effectively, and pressure in the heart increases, making it harder for your heart to deliver oxygen and nutrients to your body. To compensate for reduced pumping power, the heart's chambers respond by stretching to hold more blood. This keeps the blood moving, but over time, the heart muscle walls may weaken and become unable to pump as strongly. As a result, the kidneys often respond by causing the body to retain fluid (water) and sodium. The resulting fluid buildup in the arms, legs, ankles, feet, lungs, or other organs, and is called congestive heart failure. High blood pressure may also bring on heart failure by causing left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle that results in less effective muscle relaxation between heart beats. This makes it difficult for the heart to fill with enough blood to supply the body's organs, especially during exercise, leading your body to hold onto fluids and your heart rate to increase. Symptoms of heart failure include: Shortness of breath Swelling in the feet, ankles, or abdomen Difficulty sleeping flat in bed Bloating Irregular pulse Nausea Fatigue Greater need to urinate at night High blood pressure can also cause ischemic heart disease. This means that the heart muscle isn't getting enough blood. Ischemic heart disease is usually the result of atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries (coronary artery disease), which impedes blood flow to the heart. Symptoms of ischemic heart disease may include: Chest pain which may radiate (travel) to the arms, back, neck, or jaw Chest pain with nausea, sweating, shortness of breath, and dizziness; these associated symptoms may also occur without chest pain Irregular pulse Fatigue and weakness Any of these symptoms of ischemic heart disease warrant immediate medical evaluation. Your doctor will look for certain signs of hypertensive heart disease, including: High blood pressure Enlarged heart and irregular heartbeat Fluid in the lungs or lower extremities Unusual heart sounds Your doctor may perform tests to determine if you have hypertensive heart disease, including an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, chest X-ray, and coronary angiogram. In order to treat hypertensive heart disease, your doctor has to treat the high blood pressure that is causing it. He or she will treat it with a variety of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and vasodilators. In addition, your doctor may advise you to make changes to your lifestyle, including: Diet: If heart failure is present, you should lower your daily intake of sodium to 1,500 mg or 2 g or less per day, eat foods high in fiber and potassium, limit total daily calories to lose weight if necessary, and limit intake of foods that contain refined sugar, trans fats, and cholesterol. Monitoring your weight: This involves daily recording of weight, increasing your activity level (as recommended by your doctor), resting between activities more often, and planning your activities. Avoiding tobacco products and alcohol Regular medical checkups: During follow-up visits, your doctor will make sure you are staying healthy and that your heart disease is not getting worse."
1,"Are you behind on your dental visits, and now you're being driven in by a toothache, other dental problems, or guilt? If so, be prepared -- not for a lecture from your dentist -- but for discovering that there is a host of new options to keep teeth healthy and beautiful. Here are some of the newer dental care procedures and techniques that leading dentists are bringing into their practices. In many dental offices, digitized X-rays (think digital camera) are replacing traditional radiographs. Although digital X-rays have been on the market for several years, they have recently become more popular with dentists. Digital X-rays are faster and more efficient than traditional radiographs. First, an electronic sensor or phosphor plate (instead of film) is placed in the patient's mouth to capture the image. The digital image is then relayed or scanned to a computer, where it is available for viewing. The procedure is much faster than processing conventional film. Your dentist can also store digital images on the computer and compare them with previous or future images to see how your dental health is being maintained. And because the sensor and phosphor plates are more sensitive to X-rays than film is, the radiation dose is significantly reduced. Digital X-rays have many uses besides finding cavities. They also help look at the bone below the teeth to determine if the bone level of support is good. Dentists can use the X-rays to check the placement of an implant -- a titanium screw-like device that is inserted into the jawbone so that an artificial tooth can be attached. Digital X-rays also help endodontists -- dentists who specialize in root canals -- to see if they have performed the procedure properly. Traditionally, dentists use an instrument they call the ""explorer"" to find cavities. That's the instrument they poke around with in your mouth during a checkup. When it ""sticks"" in a tooth, they look closer to see if they find decay. Many dentists are now switching to the diode laser, a higher-tech option for detecting tooth decay. The dentist can then choose to watch the tooth, comparing the levels at the next visit, or advise that the cavity be removed and the tooth filled. When healthy teeth are exposed to the wavelength of the diode laser, they don't glow or fluoresce, so the reading on the digital display is low. But decayed teeth glow in proportion to the amount of decay, resulting in higher readings on the display. The diode laser doesn't always work with teeth that already have fillings, but for other teeth, it could mean earlier detection of cavities. Note also that the diode laser does not replace X-rays; it detects decay in grooves on the chewing surface, while bitewing X-rays can find decay between and inside teeth. The CAD in this technology stands for âcomputer-assisted design,â and the CAM for âcomputer-assisted manufacture.â Together, they translate into fewer dental visits to complete procedures such as crowns and bridges. Traditionally when a patient needs a crown, a dentist must make a mold of the tooth and fashion a temporary crown, then wait for the dental laboratory to make a permanent one. With CAD/ CAM technology, the tooth is drilled to prepare it for the crown and a picture is taken with a computer. This image is then relayed to a machine that makes the crown right in the office. Veneers are the thin, custom-made shells or moldings that are used to cover the front of crooked or otherwise unattractive teeth. New materials now make it possible to create even thinner veneers that are just as strong. What's the advantage for you? Preparing a tooth for a veneer - which involves reshaping the tooth to allow for the added thickness of the veneer -- can be minimal with the thinner veneers. Less of the tooth surface must be reduced and more of the natural tooth is kept intact. If you've chipped a tooth, you can have it fixed to look more natural than it would have in the past, thanks to improvements in bonding material and bonding techniques. Today's bonding material is a resin (plastic), which is shinier and longer lasting than the substance used in the past. Often, dentists will put layers of resin on a tooth to bond and repair it. Because of the wider range of shades available, they can better blend the bonding material to the tooth's natural color. In restorations, when a cavity needs to be filled, many dentists have also abandoned amalgams for ""tooth-colored"" composite or porcelain fillings, which look more natural. Implants to replace lost teeth are now more common than in years past. First, a titanium implant or screw-like device is inserted to serve as a replacement root, fusing with the jawbone and protruding above the gum line. An abutment covers the protruding part and a crown is placed over that. In the past, implants often failed. Now, the typical life of an implant is about 15 years or longer. About 95% of implants today are successful, according to the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. When the supporting tissue and bone around your teeth doesn't fit snugly, ""pockets"" form in the gums. Bacteria then invade these pockets, increasing bone destruction and tooth loss. A variety of treatments can help reverse the damage. They range from cleaning the root surfaces to remove plaque and tartar to more extreme measures such as gum surgery to reduce the pockets. In recent years, the focus of gum disease treatment has expanded beyond reducing the pockets and removing the bacteria to include regenerative procedures. For instance, lasers, membranes, bone grafts, or proteins that stimulate tissue growth can be used to help regenerate bone and tissue to combat the gum disease."
2,"Delusional disorder, previously called paranoid disorder, is a type of serious mental illness called a psychotic disorder. People who have it can't tell what's real from what is imagined. Delusions are the main symptom of delusional disorder. They're unshakable beliefs in something that isn't true or based on reality. But that doesn't mean they're completely unrealistic. Delusional disorder involves delusions that aren't bizarre, having to do with situations that could happen in real life, like being followed, poisoned, deceived, conspired against, or loved from a distance. These delusions usually involve mistaken perceptions or experiences. But in reality, the situations are either not true at all or highly exaggerated. A bizarre delusion, by contrast, is something that could never happen in real life, such as being cloned by aliens or having your thoughts broadcast on TV. A person who has such thoughts might be considered delusional with bizarre-type delusions. People with delusional disorder often can continue to socialize and function normally, apart from the subject of their delusion, and generally do not behave in an obviously odd or bizarre manner. This is unlike people with other psychotic disorders, who also might have delusions as a symptom of their disorder. But in some cases, people with delusional disorder might become so preoccupied with their delusions that their lives are disrupted. Although delusions might be a symptom of more common disorders, such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder itself is rather rare. Delusional disorder most often happens in middle to late life and is slightly more common in women than in men. The types are based on the main theme of the delusion: Erotomanic: The person believes someone is in love with them and might try to contact that person. Often it's someone important or famous. This can lead to stalking behavior. Grandiose: This person has an over-inflated sense of worth, power, knowledge, or identity. They could believe they have a great talent or made an important discovery. Jealous: A person with this type believes their spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful. Persecutory: Someone who has this believes they (or someone close to them) are being mistreated, or that someone is spying on them or planning to harm them. They might make repeated complaints to legal authorities. Somatic: They believe they have a physical defect or medical problem. Mixed: These people have two or more of the types of delusions listed above. They usually include: Non-bizarre delusions -- these are the most obvious symptom Irritable, angry, or low mood Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren't really there) related to the delusion. For example, someone who believes they have an odor problem might smell a bad odor. As with many other psychotic disorders, the exact cause of delusional disorder is not yet known. But researchers are looking at the role of genetic, biological, environmental, or psychological factors that make it more likely. Genetic: The fact that delusional disorder is more common in people who have family members with delusional disorder or schizophrenia suggests genes may be involved. It is believed that, as with other mental disorders, a tendency to have delusional disorder might be passed on from parents to their children. Biological: Researchers are studying how delusional disorders might happen when parts of the brain aren't normal. Abnormal brain regions that control perception and thinking may be linked to the delusional symptoms. Environmental/psychological: Evidence suggests that stress can trigger delusional disorder. Alcohol and drug abuse also might contribute to it. People who tend to be isolated, such as immigrants or those with poor sight and hearing, appear to be more likely to have delusional disorder. If you have symptoms of delusional disorder, your doctor will likely give you a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose delusional disorder, the doctor might use diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies or blood tests, to rule out physical illness as the cause of the symptoms. These include: Alzheimer's disease Epilepsy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Delirium Other schizophrenia spectrum disorders If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, they might refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist, health care professionals trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. They'll use interview and assessment tools to evaluate the person for a psychotic disorder. The doctor or therapist bases the diagnosis on the person's symptoms and their own observation of the person's attitude and behavior. They'll decide if the symptoms point to a disorder. A diagnosis of delusional disorder is made if: The person has one or more delusions that last a month or longer. The person has never been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Hallucinations, if they have them, are related to the themes of their delusions. Apart from the delusions and its effects, their life isn't really affected. Other behavior isn't bizarre or odd. Manic or major depressive episodes, if they've happened, have been brief, when compared with the delusions. There isn't another mental disorder, medication, or medical condition to blame. Treatment most often includes medication and psychotherapy (a type of counseling). Delusional disorder can be very difficult to treat, in part because those who have it often have poor insight and do not know there's a psychiatric problem. Studies show that close to half of patients treated with antipsychotic medications show at least partial improvement. The primary medications used to attempt to treat delusional disorder are called antipsychotics. Drugs used include: Conventional antipsychotics: Also called neuroleptics, these have been used to treat mental disorders since the mid-1950s. They work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter believed to be involved in the development of delusions. Conventional antipsychotics include Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine) Fluphenazine ( Prolixin) Haloperidol ( Haldol) Loxapine ( Oxilapine) Perphenazine ( Trilafon), Thioridazine ( Mellaril), Thiothixene ( Navane) Trifluoperazine ( Stelazine) Atypical antipsychotics: These newer drugs appear to be help treat the symptoms of delusional disorder with fewer movement-related side effects than the older typical antipsychotics. They work by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter believed to be involved in delusional disorder. These drugs include: Aripiprazole ( Abilify) Aripiprazole Lauroxil ( Aristada) Asenapine ( Saphris) Brexpiprazole ( Rexulti) Cariprazine ( Vraylar) Clozapine ( Clozaril) Iloperidone ( Fanapt) Lurasidone ( Latuda) Paliperidone ( Invega Sustenna) Paliperidone Palmitate ( Invega Trinza) Quetiapine ( Seroquel), Risperidone ( Risperdal), Olanzapine ( Zyprexa) Ziprasidone ( Geodon) Other medications: Sedatives and antidepressants might also be used to treat anxiety or mood symptoms if they happen with delusional disorder. Tranquilizers might be used if the person has a very high level of anxiety or problems sleeping. Antidepressants might be used to treat depression, which often happens in people with delusional disorder Psychotherapy can also be helpful, along with medications, as a way to help people better manage and cope with the stresses related to their delusional beliefs and its impact on their lives. Psychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder include: Individual psychotherapy can help the person recognize and correct the thinking that has become distorted. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT) can help the person learn to recognize and change thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings. Family therapy can help families deal with a loved one who has delusional disorder, enabling them help the person. People with severe symptoms or who are at risk of hurting themselves or others might need to be hospitalized until the condition is stabilized. People with delusional disorder might become depressed, often as the result of difficulties associated with the delusions. Acting on the delusions also can lead to violence or legal problems. For example, a person with an erotomanic delusion who stalks or harasses the object of the delusion could be arrested. Also, people with this disorder can become alienated from others, especially if their delusions interfere with or damage their relationships. It varies, depending on the person, the type of delusional disorder, and the person's life circumstances, including the presence of support and a willingness to stick with treatment. Delusional disorder is typically a chronic (ongoing) condition, but when properly treated, many people can find relief from their symptoms. Some recover completely, while others have bouts of delusional beliefs with periods of remission (lack of symptoms). Unfortunately, many people with this disorder don't seek help. It's often hard for people with a mental disorder to know they aren't well. Or they may credit their symptoms to other things, like the environment. They also might be too embarrassed or afraid to seek treatment. Without treatment, delusional disorder can be a lifelong illness. There's no known way to prevent delusional disorder. But early diagnosis and treatment can help lessen the disruption to the person's life, family, and friendships."
3,"You did your best to protect yourself from breaking a bone due to osteoporosis. Or maybe you didn't even know your bones were at risk. Either way, your fracture can heal, and you can work closely with your doctor to avoid it ever happening again. Fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist are the most common types in people with osteoporosis. Falls and bumps that wouldn't hurt a person with healthy bones can damage them when you have osteoporosis. Doctors call these injuries low trauma or fragility fractures. If you fall from standing height and break a bone, for example, you'll need treatment for this type of injury. Some fractures can heal on their own, depending on which bone is broken and how severe the break is. When you need further treatment, your doctor may refer you on to specialists such as: An orthopedic doctor, who can help cast and repair your broken bone. A physiatrist, who treats nerve, muscle, and bone problems that affect how you move. A physical therapist or occupational therapist, who show you exercises and other ways to recover and get back to your regular activities. Fractures can hurt for a while, especially if you've broken a hip or a vertebra in your spine, called a compression fracture. You may need medicine for the pain. Ask your doctor to review everything you take, too, even if you didn't need a prescription for it or if it says ânaturalâ on the label. She can check on any possible side effects, like dizziness, that could make you more likely to fall. In some cases, you'll only need rest, pain medicine, exercises, and perhaps a back brace or treatment for muscle spasms while you heal. And you may need to wear a brace to keep your spine stable during that time. If your pain lasts and is severe, your doctor may see if it might help for you to get: Vertebroplasty. Your doctor injects bone cement into the spine to keep it stable. This lessens pain. It can also help prevent further fractures of the vertebrae and a curved spine. Kyphoplasty. A doctor inserts a balloon device into the fractured vertebra. This helps restore the height and shape of the vertebra. Once removed, the device leaves a small cavity that the doctor then fills with special bone cement. If your doctor recommends either procedure, talk with them about the risks, benefits, and recovery time. Treating a hip fracture depends on where your hip is broken, how severe the break is, and your overall health. Treatment options may include: Surgical repair with screws, nails, or plates A partial or total hip replacement Exercises so that you move better and build strength The best treatment depends on the location of the break. With the right protection, some fractures may heal on their own. Then you may simply need: A cast or splint Exercises for your hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, or shoulder When you need surgery, a doctor may implant a plate, screws, wires, rods, pins, or an external fixator. These devices hold the bone in place while it heals. If the bone is in more than two pieces, a bone graft can help make it heal faster. When you have osteoporosis, all of your treatments focus on protecting and strengthening your bones. These include diet, exercise, supplements (including calcium and vitamin D), and osteoporosis medicines. It's also a good idea to work with your doctor -- or a physical therapist or occupational therapist -- to change the way you do certain activities and start balance training to help you prevent falls. Last but not least, you'll want to troubleshoot your home for things that could make a fall more likely. For instance, rugs should have pads that stick to the floor. Your stairs need a handrail. And make sure to get your eyes checked, because vision problems can also make falls more likely."
4,"Guttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that shows up on your skin as red, scaly, small, teardrop-shaped spots. It doesn't normally leave a scar. You usually get it as a child or young adult. Less than a third of people with psoriasis have this type. It's not as common as plaque psoriasis. It's an autoimmune disease, meaning your body treats your own cells like invaders and attacks them. You might get it only once, or you could have several flare-ups. In some cases, this type of psoriasis doesn't go away. With the help of your doctor, you can find a treatment to keep your symptoms under control. The spots you get from guttate psoriasis aren't as thick as the ones from plaque psoriasis. You can sometimes have both kinds of psoriasis at once. You probably would get them on your arms, legs, stomach, and chest. It can sometimes spread from there to your face, ears, and scalp. But it doesn't show up on your palms, the soles of your feet, or nails like other forms of psoriasis can. You're more likely to have a flare-up during the winter, when the air is dry. Your symptoms may clear up more quickly in summer. There are three: Mild. Only a few spots cover about 3% of your skin. Moderate. Lesions cover about 3%-10% of your skin. Severe. Lesions cover 10% or more of your body and could cover your entire body. The stage can also be based on how much they interfere with your daily life and activities. For example, psoriasis on your face or scalp can affect only 2%-3% of your total body surface area, but it could be classified as severe because it affects your appearance and livelihood. Psoriasis on your hands might only cover 2% total body surface area, but could affect your livelihood if you work with your hands. In that case it would be classified as moderate to severe. An outbreak is usually triggered by a bacterial infection -- typically streptococcus (strep throat). It sets off an immune system reaction that causes the spots on your skin. In some cases, guttate psoriasis is genetic. If someone in your family has it, your chances of getting it go up. Other triggers include: Upper respiratory infections Tonsillitis Stress Cuts, burns, or bites on your skin Some drugs you take (antimalarials and beta-blockers) Your doctor will want to know your medical history, especially what kinds of medications you may be taking. She'll look at your skin. Usually, a physical exam gives your doctor enough information to diagnose or rule out guttate psoriasis. If she needs more information, your doctor may take a blood sample or a throat culture to check for strep. It's also common for doctors to perform a skin biopsy when they want to know for sure what you have. In most cases an outbreak of guttate psoriasis lasts 2 to 3 weeks. But your doctor may want to treat your symptoms and help prevent other infections in your body. Medications. There are several over-the-counter or prescription options for the itchy, flaky skin, as well as the dryness and swelling. They include: Cortisone cream for itching and swelling Dandruff shampoo for your scalp Lotions with coal tar to soothe your skin Moisturizers Prescription medicines with or vitamin AIf your case is more serious, your doctor may give you a prescription to take by mouth. These include: Corticosteroids Methotrexate Apremilast ( Otezla) Phototherapy. Also known as light therapy, this is another option. Your doctor will shine ultraviolet light onto your skin during this treatment. She may also give you medication to make your skin react more quickly to light. Sometimes, just going out into the sunshine can help."
5,"Nausea is an uneasiness of the stomach that often comes before vomiting. Vomiting is the forcible voluntary or involuntary emptying (""throwing up"") of stomach contents through the mouth. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Nausea and vomiting are not diseases, but they are symptoms of many conditions such as: Motion sickness or seasickness Early stages of pregnancy (nausea occurs in approximately 50%-90% of all pregnancies; vomiting in 25%-55%) Medication-induced vomiting Intense pain Emotional stress (such as fear) Gallbladder disease Food poisoning Infections (such as the ""stomach flu"") Overeating A reaction to certain smells or odors Heart attack Concussion or brain injury Brain tumor Ulcers Some forms of cancer Bulimia or other psychological illnesses Gastroparesis or slow stomach emptying (a condition that can be seen in people with diabetes) Ingestion of toxins or excessive amounts of alcohol Bowel obstruction Appendicitis The causes of vomiting differ according to age. For children, it is common for vomiting to occur from a viral infection, food poisoning, milk allergy, motion sickness, overeating or feeding, coughing, or blocked intestines and illnesses in which the child has a high fever. The timing of the nausea or vomiting can indicate the cause. When appearing shortly after a meal, nausea or vomiting may be caused by food poisoning, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), an ulcer, or bulimia. Nausea or vomiting one to eight hours after a meal may also indicate food poisoning. However, certain food- borne bacteria, such as salmonella, can take longer to produce symptoms. Usually, vomiting is harmless, but it can be a sign of a more serious illness. Some examples of serious conditions that may result in nausea or vomiting include concussions, meningitis (infection of the membrane linings of the brain), intestinal blockage, appendicitis, and brain tumors. Another concern is dehydration. Adults have a lower risk of becoming dehydrated, because they can usually detect the symptoms of dehydration (such as increased thirst and dry lips or mouth). But young children have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated, especially if they also have diarrhea, because they often are unable to communicate symptoms of dehydration. Adults caring for sick children need to be aware of these visible signs of dehydration: dry lips and mouth, sunken eyes, and rapid breathing or pulse. In infants, also watch for decreased urination and a sunken fontanelle (soft spot on top of the baby's head). Recurrent vomiting in pregnancy can lead to a serious condition called hyperemesis gravidarum in which the mother may develop fluid and mineral imbalances that can endanger her life or that of her unborn child. Rarely, excessive vomiting can tear the lining of the esophagus, also known as a Mallory- Weiss tear. If the esophagus is ruptured, this is called Boerhaave's syndrome, and is a medical emergency. Call a doctor about nausea and vomiting: If the nausea lasts for more than a few days or if there is a possibility of being pregnant If home treatment is not working, dehydration is present, or a known injury has occurred (such as head injury or infection) that may be causing the vomiting Adults should consult a doctor if vomiting occurs for more than one day, diarrhea and vomiting last more than 24 hours, or there are signs of dehydration. Take an infant or child under six years to the doctor if vomiting lasts more than a few hours, diarrhea is present, signs of dehydration occur, there is a fever, or if the child hasn't urinated for 4-6 hours. Take a child over age six years to the doctor if vomiting lasts one day, diarrhea combined with vomiting lasts for more than 24 hours, there are any signs of dehydration, there is a fever higher than 101 degrees, or the child hasn't urinated for six hours. You should seek immediate medical care if any of the following situations occur with vomiting: There is blood in the vomit (bright red or ""coffee grounds"" in appearance) Severe headache or stiff neck Lethargy, confusion, or a decreased alertness Severe abdominal pain Diarrhea Rapid breathing or pulse Treatment for vomiting (regardless of age or cause) includes: Drinking gradually larger amounts of clear liquids Avoiding solid food until the vomiting episode has passed If vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, an oral rehydrating solution such as Pedialyte should be used to prevent and treat dehydration. Pregnant women experiencing morning sickness can eat some crackers before getting out of bed or eat a high protein snack before going to bed (lean meat or cheese). Vomiting associated with cancer treatments can often be treated with another type of drug therapy. There are also prescription and nonprescription drugs that can be used to control vomiting associated with pregnancy, motion sickness, and some forms of dizziness. However, consult with a doctor before using any of these treatments. There are several ways to try and prevent nausea from developing: Eat small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals. Eat slowly. Avoid hard-to-digest foods. Consume foods that are cold or room temperature if you nauseated by the smell of hot or warm foods. Rest after eating with your head elevated about 12 inches above your feet. Drink liquids between meals rather than during meals. Try to eat when you feel less nauseated. When you begin to feel nauseated, you may be able to prevent vomiting by: Drinking small amounts of clear, sweetened liquids such as soda or fruit juices (except orange and grapefruit juices, because these are too acidic) Resting either in a sitting position or in a propped lying position; activity may worsen nausea and may lead to vomiting. To prevent nausea and vomiting in children: To treat motion sickness in a car, seat your child so he or she faces the front windshield (watching fast movement out the side windows can make the nausea worse). Also, reading or playing video games in the car could cause motion sickness. Don't let kids eat and play at the same time."
6,"Whether you travel for business or pleasure, you know rheumatoid arthritis is one thing that will always come with you. But you can still go wherever you need or want to go. Make it easier on yourself with these tips. Do your homework. Find out as much as you can about your destination and plan all the details you can ahead of time, including what places you'll go, how you'll get there, and what your travel companions can do when you need a rest. Time it right. Choose a time when you're most likely to feel your best. If you tend to get flares during the heat of the summer or the hustle and bustle of the holidays, for example, try to avoid traveling during those times. Don't rush. Although vacations can be fun and restful, they can also be stressful. Try to plan an extra day at the start of your vacation to prepare and another at the end to rest and recover before you go back to work or regular activities. Ask about immunizations. If you're going to travel overseas, ask your doctor about any vaccines you may need. Remind him of what medicines you take, since some immunizations aren't advised if you take medications that suppress your immune system. Choose the right suitcase. Buy a suitcase or bag with wheels, and push instead of pulling it. Use both hands to take it easy on your hands and shoulders. Pack light. Your bags will be easier to carry. If you find that you must lift your suitcase -- into your car trunk or the overhead bin on a plane, for example -- find someone who can help. Don't forget your health info. Write out a brief medical history and list of medications you take. Include contact information for your primary care doctor and rheumatologist, as well as your health insurance information. Mind your medications. Pack more medicine than you think you'll need, and divide it among your different bags. If one bag is lost, you should still have enough medicine to get by. Leave a copy of your prescriptions at home with a friend or family member. If you lose your medications or are gone longer than expected, have them send you your prescription. Don't just sit there. Sitting for hours in a car, plane, bus, or train can lead to stiff joints. When driving, stop once an hour to stretch and walk. When you fly, take a train, or ride a bus, try to get an aisle seat so you can stretch and get up and walk. Avoid crowds. Avoid standing in long lines and flying in crowded planes. Ask the airline or travel agent about times with the least traffic. Bring a doctor's note. If you use medications that require needles, bring a doctor's note or prescription in case you're asked about them at airport security. Avoid stops. When possible, choose nonstop flights. That way you won't have to walk long distances through unfamiliar airports. Arrange for assistive devices. If you use a wheelchair, label it with your name, address, and destination airport -- and ask that it be loaded ""last on/first off."" If you use a cane, you can take it on board with you. You'll need to stow it at takeoff and landing, but you can use it during the flight. Pick your room location. When you make hotel reservations, look for a room on or near the main level so you can skip the stairs. Request a refrigerator. If you take medications that need to be refrigerated, an in-room refrigerator is a must. It can also come in handy if you need a quick snack to take medications or to boost your energy level after a day of sightseeing. Look for amenities. A pool can help you stick to your exercise routine, a hot tub can ease sore joints, and an on-site restaurant or room service is helpful if you don't feel like going out at mealtime."
7,"Some side effects of chemotherapy only happen while you're having treatment and disappear quickly after it's over. But others can linger for months or years, or may never completely go away. Watch out for signs of chemo's long-term changes, and let your doctor know how you feel. He can suggest ways to manage your symptoms. If you feel a little foggy when your treatment is done, you might have a touch of chemo brain. You may notice that you find it hard time to concentrate or remember names and dates. You may also forget things easily or have trouble doing more than one thing at a time. Doctors aren't sure of the exact cause of chemo brain. It seems more likely to happen if you had higher doses of chemotherapy. Certain chemo drugs can damage cells in your heart. Chemotherapy may also increase your odds of having heart problems, such as: Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Problems with your heart rhythm (arrhythmia) Heart attack If your doctor plans to give you a medication that could affect your heart, he may ask you to get tests that monitor how well your ticker works. If you lost some or all of your hair after chemo, it will typically start to grow back in a month or two. But it's possible that at first it may not look like it used to. Its texture, shape, and color may be different. Over time, as the effects of the chemo on your hair follicles wear off, your hair will probably go back to the way it was before treatment. In rare cases, such as after years of strong chemotherapy, your hair follicles could shut down. This can prevent new hair from growing, and you may become permanently bald. Some types of chemo can make you put on extra pounds. You may find that the weight stays on even when your treatment ends. For instance, some drugs that treat breast cancer can cause you to lose muscle and gain fat, which makes it much more difficult to get the weight off. Work with a dietitian or nutritionist and add strength training exercises to your workout routine to help you shed some pounds. You probably remember the fatigue that hit you while you were getting chemo. But some people still feel extremely tired after treatment ends. You may find that even when you get enough rest, you still feel sluggish. Talk to your doctor for suggestions on ways to raise your energy level. Chemotherapy can affect your ability to have children, whether you're a man or woman. For guys, the reason has to do with the way chemo drugs target fast-growing cancer cells. Since healthy sperm cells divide quickly, chemo can also damage them. If chemo kills the immature stem cells in your testicles that become new sperm, you may become infertile, which means you can't have children. If you're a woman, chemotherapy can damage your eggs and harm your ovaries. You may stop having regular menstrual cycles after treatment. Many women who have chemo go through menopause at an earlier age than usual. For both men and women, chemotherapy's effect on fertility depends on a number of things, including the type of drugs you used and the dose. The higher the dose of chemo, the more likely it is to have an impact. If you're having long-term effects from chemo, talk to your doctor to get tips on how to manage them. And reach out to your friends and family to get the support you need."
8,"Weight cycling is losing weight and regaining it over and over. It's called ""yo-yo"" dieting when it happens because of dieting. Weight cycles can be big (50 pounds or more) or small (5-10 pounds). Is it bad for you? That's not clear. Staying overweight isn't healthy, so ask your doctor what your goal weight should be, what you should do to reach that weight, and what it takes to stay at that weight. Your doctor may not have all the answers, so ask him for a referral to a dietitian to help you find ways to eat better and lose extra weight. Working with a personal trainer will help you get on track with exercise, which is especially important in keeping the pounds off once you reach your goal weight. You can break the cycle of losing and regaining weight. Researchers showed that by following 439 overweight women for a year. The women who had a history of moderate or big weight cycles were just as likely to stick to the study's diet and exercise plan. Anyone who stuck to the plan benefited. For more inspiration, consider some of the key findings from more than 10,000 people who have lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off for at least a year. They shared their strategies with the National Weight Control Registry, which posted them on its web site: 78% eat breakfast every day. 75% weigh themselves at least once a week. 62% watch less than 10 hours of TV per week. 90% exercise, on average, about 1 hour per day."
9,"If you or your child gets a cut, scrape, or burn, it's important to clean the wound properly right away to prevent infection. Here's how to do it in five easy steps. Clean your hands using soap and water or hand sanitizer, then put on disposable gloves, if possible. Do this before you touch your wound or treat someone else's burn, cut, or scrape. Clean, covered hands help prevent infections. This step applies only if the wound is bleeding. Skip this step for burns. Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze to gently press on the wound until bleeding stops (small cuts and scrapes may not require pressure). Elevate (raise) the affected part, if possible. If blood oozes through the cloth or gauze, leave the covering on the wound. Place another clean piece on top and continue to apply pressure. Seek medical attention right away if: The wound is on a child under a year old Bleeding is severe or doesn't stop with gentle pressure Your wound has jagged edges The cut is deep, gaping, or across a joint The wound was caused by a dirty object or was the result of a projectile or something impaling the skin The wound was caused by a human or animal bite The wound happened on the face or genital area Stitches are usually needed for cuts longer than ½ inch. If you have a cut on your face that's ¼ inch or longer, a doctor may close it with surgical glue or sutures. You don't need hydrogen peroxide or iodine products to thoroughly clean a simple cut or scrape. Just follow these steps: Rinse the wound in clear water to loosen and remove dirt and debris. Use a soft washcloth and mild soap to clean around the wound. Don't place soap in the wound. That can hurt and cause irritation. Use tweezers to remove any dirt or debris that still appears after washing. Clean the tweezers first with isopropyl alcohol. Don't pick at the wound. If the wound can't be cleaned, call a doctor. If you have a burn, rinse the area under cool (not cold) water for 10 to 15 minutes. Or, place a cool cloth on the burn for the same length of time. See your doctor if any large blisters form. Go to the emergency room right away if you have any major burns. Over-the-counter skin antibiotics, like Neosporin or Polysporin, help keep the skin moist and ward off infection. It's not always necessary to use these if you have a minor cut or scrape. But applying a thin layer can boost your body's natural healing process and reduce scarring. Doctors may recommend using a topical antibiotic if you have burn blisters that break open. Some people are allergic to certain ingredients in these products. Stop using the cream or ointment if a rash appears. You don't need to bandage every boo-boo. If you have a minor scrape or cut, clean it and leave it alone. Otherwise, place a clean, sterile, nonstick bandage on the wound after cleaning it. This helps keep out germs. You can find a variety of bandages and tape at your local drugstore. Paper tape may be less irritating to sensitive skin. Change the bandage at least once a day or when it's wet or dirty. Be extra careful to cover any cuts or wounds on areas that tend to get dirty or germy, like your hands or feet. You also want to bandage any wound that would rub on clothing, such as a cut on your knee. Always cover large wounds. Don't pick at any scabs -- they're part of the healing process. Picking at them can leave a scar. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms. They could mean the wound is infected: Increased redness or swelling Pain that gets worse Skin around the wound feels warm Unpleasant odor when cleaning the wound Unusual or increased drainage Fever or chills If you have a burn, or a wound that breaks the skin, check with your doctor to see if you need a tetanus booster."
10,"If you have thrombocytopenia, you don't have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets help your blood clot, which stops bleeding. For most people, it's not a big problem. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed spontaneously in your eyes, gums, or bladder or bleed too much when you're injured. A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 400,000. You have thrombocytopenia if your number falls under 150,000. If you're wondering what the long name means, here's how it breaks down: "" Thrombocytes"" are your platelets, and ""penia"" means you don't have enough of something. Put those terms together, and you get ""thrombocytopenia."" Thrombocytopenia has many causes. One of the most common causes of low platelets is a condition called immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP). You may hear it called by its old name, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Although doctors don't know what causes ITP, they know that it happens when your immune system -- your body's main defense against disease -- doesn't work right. Your antibodies, which are supposed to attack infections, instead mistakenly destroy your platelets. Thrombocytopenia can run in families, but you can also get it from many medical conditions. Treating the medical condition may improve ITP. If your thrombocytopenia is not due to ITP, your body might have fewer platelets because of these causes: Viral infections (including chickenpox, parvovirus, hepatitis C, Epstein- Barr, and HIV) Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia Sepsis, a severe bacterial infection in your blood Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori), a bacteria that can live in your digestive system Medicines Medication side effects, including drugs for heart problems, seizures, and infections Heparin, a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots Chemotherapy Work with your doctor to figure out if a drug is causing your platelet count to drop. He may be able to adjust your dose or change your medication. Other Treatments Heart bypass surgery Radiation treatment on your bone marrow Medical Conditions Blood cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma A problem with your bone marrow, like toxicity from drinking too much alcohol Vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9) deficiency Pregnancy. Up to 5% of healthy women get it during pregnancy, and it usually gets better on its own after your baby is born. But it can also be a sign of something more concerning, like preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. An enlarged spleen Your body uses too many platelets, leaving you without enough of them. That can happen if you have an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Rare disorders like hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP), which uses a lot of platelets to make small blood clots throughout your body Usually, thrombocytopenia has no symptoms. But when you do have them, they can include: Bleeding, most often from the gums or nose. Women with thrombocytopenia may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. You may also see blood in your pee or poop. Red, flat spots on your skin, about the size of a pinhead. You see these mostly on your legs and feet, and they may appear in clumps. Your doctor may call them petechiae. Blotches and bruises. You might have large areas of bleeding under the skin that don't turn white when you press on them. You also might see what look like the bruises you get from a bump or being hit. They could be blue or purple and change to yellow or green over time. These are caused from the inside, by the sudden leaking from tiny blood vessels. The medical name for these is purpura. Severe thrombocytopenia can cause a lot of bleeding after an injury, such as a fall. Thrombocytopenia is often found by chance when your doctor does a routine blood test. They might ask you: What symptoms (including bleeding) have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? What medications and supplements are you taking? Have you had any shots in the last month, a blood transfusion, or used drugs with a needle? Does anyone in your family have a problem with their immune system, bleeding, or bruising? What have you eaten recently? Your doctor may do a physical exam to check you for signs of bleeding and feel if your spleen seems big. Some tests check for low platelet levels: CBC (complete blood count). This measures the amount of your red and white blood cells and platelets. Blood smear. This shows how your platelets look under a microscope. Bone marrow test. Your doctor uses a very fine needle to draw a small amount of liquid bone marrow and check it for cells that may not be working right. Or you may get a biopsy, using a different kind of needle, so your doctor can check the types and numbers of cells in the bone marrow. You may need more tests to help your doctor figure out what's going on. What's causing the problem? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? How will we know if the treatment is working? When will I start to feel better? What do you expect for my case? Does this condition put me at risk for anything else? Do I need to see a specialist? There are a lot of treatment options for thrombocytopenia and ITP. You'll need to work with your doctor to weigh the pros and cons of each and find a therapy that's right for you. If you have ITP, your treatment depends on how severe a case you have. If it's mild, you may only need to get regular checks of your platelet levels. When you do need treatment, the goal is to get your platelet count to a level that's high enough to prevent serious bleeding in the gut or brain. Your doctor will likely suggest these treatments for ITP first: Corticosteroids. Dexamethasone or prednisone is typically prescribed to raise your platelet count. You take it once a day in the form of a pill or tablet. An increased or normalized platelet count is generally seen within 2 weeks of therapy, particularly with high-dose dexamethasone. Your doctor will then likely cut your dose gradually over the next 4 to 8 weeks. The treatment may have to be repeated, but once your platelet count is normal, none is needed again. There are some side effects to prednisone, especially if you use it for a long time. Even after a short time, you can get irritable, have stomach upsets, and have other problems such as: Sleep problems Weight gain Puffy cheeks Peeing a lot Lower bone density Acne Besides side effects, another disadvantage to prednisone is that your platelet count may drop once you've finished your treatment. IVIG (intravenous immune globulin). If you can't get your platelet count up with prednisone, if you cannot tolerate steroids, or if your count drops after you're done with your treatment, your doctor may suggest IVIG. You take this medication through an IV, usually for several hours a day for 1 to 5 days. The advantage of IVIG is that it can raise your platelet count quickly. But the increase in platelets is only temporary. It is useful for people who need to get their levels boosted fast or who cannot tolerate steroids. The side effects include: Nausea and vomiting Headaches Fever and chills Surgery. If you have ITP and other treatments haven't raised your platelet levels enough, you may benefit from an operation to remove your spleen. That's the organ that destroys your platelets, so taking it out can give your platelet count a boost. But this doesn't always work. Getting your spleen removed can make it harder for you to fight infections. Your infection risk is greatest in the first 3 months after your surgery. Rituximab ( Rituxan). This drug is a type of treatment known as biologic therapy. It attacks B cells, a type of white blood cell that can destroy platelets. It's sometimes used if you have severe ITP despite treatment with steroids and you aren't able to have surgery to remove your spleen. Your doctor may also suggest it if you've had your spleen removed but you still have low platelet counts. Side effects for rituximab include: Fever Chills Weakness Nausea Headaches Weakened immune system Rho( D) immune globulin. This treatment, which you also take through an IV, is an alternative to traditional IVIG in people who have Rh+ blood. It generally takes less than half an hour. The side effects are similar to IVIG. If corticosteroids, IVIG, and Rho( D) aren't improving your platelet count and you're having bleeding problems, your doctor may switch to a second set of options. There are pros and cons for each. They include: Thrombopoietin ( TPO) receptor agonists. These drugs are also called platelet growth factors. If you have severely low platelets even after treatment with steroids, surgery to remove the spleen, or rituximab, you will likely do well on these medicines, but you may need to take them long-term. A TPO drug may also be used in someone who needs a boost in platelet count for a period of time, such as during an acute bleeding episode, in preparation for elective surgery, or while deciding about, planning, or awaiting a splenectomy. Two TPO drugs are available: eltrombopag ( Promacta) and romiplostim ( Nplate). Eltrombopag is a once-daily pill, and romiplostim is taken by shot once a week. They get your bone marrow to make more platelets. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a higher chance of getting blood clots. If you've tried those and still can't get your platelet count to the right level, your doctor may suggest these medicines: A newer drug called fostamatinib ( Tavalisse), a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is designed to treat thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic ITP who haven't gotten better with other treatments. The initial dose is a pill twice a day. Immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine ( Imuran), cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil ( Cell Cept). They work by keeping your immune system in check. Androgens, such as danazol ( Danocrine). It's not used in women because it can cause unwanted hair growth called hirsutism. Vinca alkaloids, such as vinblastine, vincristine ( Vincasar), and, rarely, cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan). Doctors sometimes suggest these if you're having severe bleeding and your platelet count isn't getting a boost from other treatments. You can still do a lot of things, but you may need to make some changes to your lifestyle to prevent getting hurt or cut. For instance, avoid sports such as football and downhill skiing. Eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens, to give your body the nutrients it needs. Ask your doctor if you should avoid food with quinine and aspartame, like tonic water, bitter lemon, bitter melon, some diet sodas, and sugar-free foods. You probably shouldn't take medicines that make bleeding easier, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if it's OK for you to drink alcohol, and if it is, how much. Your case may be different from someone else's. Your doctor will watch you to see how you're doing. If your case is mild, you may not need any treatment. But even people who do need treatment can lead full lives. Find out as much as you can about your condition so you can best manage it. The Platelet Disorder Support Association has information about ITP and ways to connect with others who also have it."
11,"A lot goes into achieving an erection. When you're turned on, nerves fire in your brain. Blood then flows into your penis. If all goes well, you're ready for sex. Sometimes, all does not go well. Occasional problems aren't anything that need treatment. If issues happen more often, you may have erectile dysfunction or ED. There are many things that can lead to ED. Stress, depression, anxiety, and alcohol use can often trigger it. In other cases, physical factors are the culprit. Sometimes, another disease will lead to ED, including the following: Diabetes: Nerves and blood vessels that aid in getting you ready for sex are damaged by this. Your chances of ED can double if your diabetes is not well-controlled. Kidney disease : Along with the other issues associated with kidney disease, your hormones, blood flow to your penis, and your nervous system -- all vital for getting an erection -- are affected. It can also sap your energy and sex drive. Nerve and brain disorders: You can't get an erection without help from your nervous system. Things like stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease disrupt vital signals. Blood vessel diseases: These can slow the flow of blood, making your body's preparation for sex difficult. Narrowed or blocked arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol are among the most common causes of ED. Other reasons for ED can include: Surgery: Nerves and tissue needed for an erection can be affected during procedures to treat prostate and bladder cancer. The problem often clears up, but it may take months. In some cases, the damage is permanent. If it is, there are treatments available to help you be ready for sex. Injury: If you hurt your pelvis, bladder, spinal cord, or penis -- and you require surgery -- you may get ED. Hormone problems: Hormones fuel sex drive. An imbalance can make you uninterested in sex. If you've had pituitary gland tumors, kidney or liver disease, depression, or hormone treatment for prostate cancer, talk with your doctor. Venous leak: To keep an erection, the blood that flows into your penis has to stay a while. If it flows out too quickly, you'll lose your erection. Injury or disease can cause this. Tobacco , alcohol, or drug use: All three can damage your blood vessels. If you have artery problems, smoking will make ED much more likely. Prescription drugs : There are more than 200 prescription drugs that can cause erectile dysfunction. Speak with your doctor if you think one of your medications may be causing this in you. Prostate enlargement : It's a normal part of aging for many men. It may also play a role. Lots of men have dealt with or are dealing with erectile dysfunction. If you think you may have it, talk with your doctor and figure out the plan that's best for you."
12,"An endometrial ablation is a procedure your doctor might consider if you bleed between your menstrual periods, have a heavy flow, or have periods that last a long time. If medicine doesn't help, your doctor might suggest endometrial ablation. It can curb the bleeding or stop it totally. Heavy menstrual bleeding can have many causes. Changing hormones might be the reason. Or it could be fibroids and polyps growing in your uterus. Endometrial ablation removes the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. In most cases, this stops you from having periods. If it doesn't completely stop your periods, your flow should at least return to normal or be very light. Endometrial ablation can put an end to heavy bleeding that gets in the way of your everyday life (maybe you need to change your tampon or pad every hour, or you bleed for more than a week). If your bleeding causes other health problems, like anemia, this procedure could also help. Still, endometrial ablation isn't right for everyone. If you're post-menopausal, you shouldn't have it done. It's also not a good idea if you have: Uterine, cervical, or endometrial cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) A vaginal or cervical infection A weak wall to your uterus An infection of the uterus A scar from a Caesarean section An intrauterine device ( IUD) A disorder of the uterus or endometrium You also shouldn't have endometrial ablation if you're pregnant or want a baby in the future. It will make it harder for you to get pregnant. Endometrial ablation isn't surgery. The doctor doesn't make any surgical cuts. Instead, she will insert very thin tools through your vagina to reach your uterus. The types will depend on what kind of ablation she does. The most common are: Hydrothermal: Your doctor gently pumps fluid into your uterus, then heats it. After 10 minutes, this destroys your uterine lining. Balloon therapy: Your doctor guides a thin tube with a special balloon on the end into your uterus. Heated fluid fills the balloon, which then expands and breaks up the lining. High-energy radio waves: Your doctor puts electrical mesh into your uterus and expands it. Then energy and heat sent by strong radio waves damage the lining, which your doctor removes with suction. Freezing: A thin probe with a very cold tip freezes off the lining of your uterus. Your doctor may call this âcryoablation.â Microwave: A special wand applies microwave energy to your uterine lining, which destroys it. Electrical: Your doctor can use an electric current to destroy the lining of your uterus, but this method isn't as commonly used as the others. Sometimes doctors can do endometrial ablation in their office. Or you may need to go into the hospital. As with any medical procedure, there's a small chance of infection or bleeding. The tools your doctor uses for your ablation could also create a hole in your uterus, cause burns, or harm nearby organs. But these problems don't happen very often. The chances that you'll get hurt during an endometrial ablation are low. It shouldn't take you long to heal from an ablation. Most women are back to their normal routine within a week. You may have some cramping and bleeding for a few days and a watery or bloody discharge for up to 3 weeks. It's also common to have nausea and an urge to pee for the first 24 hours. Your doctor will advise you not to have sex, use tampons, or douche for a few days. She may also put limits on your activity, like not lifting heavy things right away. If you need medicine for pain, ask your doctor which over-the-counter medicines are safe to take. Don't take aspirin. It could make you bleed more. If you have any of these signs, call your doctor right away: Strong-smelling discharge from your vagina Fever Chills Intense cramping or stomach pain Heavy bleeding or bleeding that doesn't stop 2 days after your ablation Trouble peeing The results of endometrial ablation don't always last. After a few years, your periods may start to get heavier and longer again. If so, let your doctor know. You may need a different treatment."

It's in your blood, muscles, organs, and even your bones. You need it, but sometimes your body holds on to too much of it. This is water retention, and it causes puffiness and swelling. It can be triggered by many different things. We all need sodium. It plays an important part in regulating blood pressure and fluid levels. But you only need a small amount. If you have too much in your system, your body holds in water. Table salt is one source of sodium, but we get more of it from processed food like lunch meat, crackers, chips, canned vegetables and soups, fast food, and even soft drinks. Check the sodium levels of food and drinks before you buy them. You can help balance your sodium by eating potassium-rich foods like bananas and spinach, and drinking plenty of water. Do you have swollen legs and ankles? Gravity keeps blood lower in your body. That increases the pressure inside the blood vessels in your legs and feet and causes fluid to leak into those tissues. Sitting or standing too long can cause your tissue to hold water. If your job keeps you on your feet, you may notice swollen legs and ankles at the end of the day. It's also common after a long time on an airplane. The key is to keep blood circulating. If you stand or sit all day, it's important to take time to move around. It's normal for a woman to feel puffy or bloated in the days leading up to her period. It usually goes away after a few days. Hormones taken for birth control or hormone replacement therapy can also cause you to hold water. Many medicines have water retention as a side effect. They include: High blood pressure medication Pain relievers known as NSAIDs, including ibuprofen Antidepressants Chemotherapy medication Ask your doctor if your meds may be the problem. If so, there may be something else you can take instead. A weak heart doesn't do a good job of pumping. That can cause you to retain water and lead to swelling in the legs and abdomen. Other symptoms of heart failure include: Weakness Lightheadedness Rapid heart rate Tired feeling Shortness of breath In extreme, heart failure can cause a dangerous buildup of fluid in the lungs. If the valves inside your veins don't close the way they should, not all of your blood gets pumped back to your heart. This causes swelling in your lower legs. Other symptoms include: Aching legs Enlarged veins Change in skin color Skin rashes Skin ulcers Water retention can also be caused other serious conditions: Deep vein thrombosis: If you have swelling in just one foot or leg, it's possible you have a blood clot. Other signs include pain, warmth, and redness. A clot can form while you're healing from surgery or during a long flight. This can be very dangerous, and you need to see your doctor right away. Pulmonary edema: People with chronic heart failure can have fluid buildup inside their lungs. Signs of this include shortness of breath; rapid, shallow breathing; and coughing. This requires emergency treatment. Preeclampsia: It's normal for women to have swelling in their feet and legs toward the end of a pregnancy. But swelling in the hands and face could be a sign of a dangerous blood pressure problem called preeclampsia. Call your doctor if you have swelling along with headache, blurred vision, or abdominal pain. Other possible causes include: Cancers including kidney, liver, and ovarian Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver Protein loss from severe malnutrition Lymphedema, a rare condition that can develop if lymph nodes are damaged or removed during cancer treatment Call your doctor. In some cases, swelling calls for immediate medical help. If it's brought on by your menstrual cycle or a salty meal, it'll go away on its own. If it's a symptom of another medical condition, treating it should help. Your doctor may also suggest you: Try a low-salt diet: Don't get more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. Take medication: Your doctor may prescribe a diuretic, or water pill. These help your body get rid of extra sodium and fluid through peeing. Raise your feet: Lie down with your feet above the level of your heart several times a day to move fluid out of your feet and ankles. Wear compression stockings: Special stockings or socks gently squeeze your lower legs to help keep your blood circulating."
14,"Your immune system is designed to fight infection and diseases, including cancer. But cancer cells can grow unchecked because they avoid your body's defenses. Immunotherapy drugs work by making cancer cells easier targets or by boosting the immune system to make it more effective against the disease. There are now several immunotherapy drugs used to treat metastatic bladder cancer. These drugs are called checkpoint inhibitors. To keep your immune system from attacking normal cells, your body uses proteins called checkpoints. They help the immune system tell if other cells are a normal part of your body and should be left alone or invaders that should be attacked. Cancer cells can trick your immune system by binding to the cells that are supposed to fight it. When that happens, the checkpoint signals your body not to attack. A checkpoint inhibitor stops these cells from binding. That way, your immune system recognizes and targets the cancer. The FDA has approved several checkpoint inhibitor drugs for advanced bladder cancer that has gotten worse during of after chemotherapy. These include: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Avelumab ( Bavencio) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) These drugs are given every 2-3 weeks by infusion, which means through a tube (an IV) that goes into a vein. One benefit of immunotherapy is it uses your body's natural defenses. Once your immune system better recognizes cancer, it can continue to target those cells even if you're treatment has ended. Other Immunotherapies for Bladder Cancer Researchers are now testing other potential immunotherapy drugs to see how well they work on their own and combined with other treatments. Researchers are also testing combinations of immunotherapies. Early results showed that nivolumab combined with another drug, ipilimumab, worked in 26% to 38% of people who took them. Researchers are also studying atezolizumab in combination with another check-point inhibitor called MTIG7192 A."

More than two-thirds of North American women who are heading into menopause have hot flashes. They also affect women who start menopause after chemotherapy or surgery to remove their ovaries. It's a sudden feeling of heat and sometimes a red, flushed face and sweating. We don't know exactly what causes them, but they may be related to changes in circulation. Hot flashes start when blood vessels near the skin's surface widen to cool off, making you break out in a sweat. Some women have a rapid heart rate or chills, too. When they happen while you sleep, they're called night sweats. They can wake you up and may make it hard to get enough rest. A hot flush is a hot flash plus redness in your face and neck. That depends. About 2 in 10 women never get hot flashes. Others have hot flashes for only a very short period of time. Still others can have them for 11 years or more. On average, however, women get hot flashes or night sweats for about 7 years. There's nothing you can do to avoid hot flashes around menopause. But you can stay away from triggers that may make them more frequent or more severe. Common ones include: Stress Caffeine Alcohol Spicy foods Tight clothing Heat Cigarette smoke Stay cool. At night, a ""chill pillow"" filled with water or other cooling material might help. Use fans during the day. Wear lightweight, looser-fitting clothes made with natural fibers such as cotton. Try deep, slow abdominal breathing (6 to 8 breaths per minute). Practice deep breathing for 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes in the evening, and when a hot flash starts. Exercise daily. Walking, swimming, bicycling, and dancing are all good choices. Plant estrogens, found in soy products, may have weak estrogen-like effects that could cut hot flashes. Doctors recommend you get your soy from foods like tofu and edamame rather than supplements. Some studies suggest black cohosh may be helpful for 6 months or less. Botanicals and herbs may have side effects or change how other medications work, so ask your doctor first. Some women can wait out hot flashes with no treatment. If they're bothersome or causing trouble for you, talk to your doctor about taking hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, for a limited time, typically less than 5 years. This prevents hot flashes for many women. Plus, it can help other symptoms of menopause, including vaginal dryness and mood disorders. When you stop taking HRT, the hot flashes may come back. Some short-term HRT can make you more likely to have blood clots, breast and endometrial cancers, and gallbladder inflammation. If HRT isn't right for you, other treatments may offer relief. Prescription treatments include: Low-dose depression drugs like fluoxetine ( Prozac, Rapiflux), paroxetine ( Paxil, Pexeva), or venlafaxine ( Effexor) Clonidine, a blood pressure medication Gabapentin, an anti-seizure drug Brisdelle, a paroxetine formula specifically for hot flashes Duavee, a conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene formula designed to treat hot flashes B complex vitamins, vitamin E, and ibuprofen may help, too. It's important to talk to your doctor before you take any new medication or supplements, including over-the-counter products."
16,"Graves' disease is a disorder that causes your thyroid gland to make too much of certain hormones -- a condition called hyperthyroidism. In addition to weight loss, a fast heartbeat, high blood pressure, and irritability, among other symptoms, it also can cause your immune system to mistakenly attack healthy cells. In some people, the muscles and tissue around the eyes are targeted. About half of people with Graves' disease notice some eye issues, and some have severe vision problems. Experts think this happens because the tissues in your eyes have proteins like ones in your thyroid gland. The problem is known as Graves' eye disease or Graves' ophthalmopathy. Doctors don't think it can be prevented, but you're more likely to get it -- and have a worse case of it -- if you smoke. Graves' ophthalmopathy can cause a wide range of issues with your eyes. Some people might have a little redness and minor pain, while others have strong swelling, dryness, and more severe pain. It's also possible to have bulging eyes -- because your muscles swell and your eyes are pushed out -- and pressure may build up in your eye socket. In rare cases, you can have double vision or other problems with your sight. Most people with the condition notice eye symptoms within 6 months (before or after) of being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. People who have severe hyperthyroidism aren't necessarily more likely to have eye trouble than those who have milder cases. If you think you may be developing Graves' ophthalmopathy, you may need to see both an endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in problems with hormones) and an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). If you know you have Graves', your doctor should be able to find out if you have the eye problem with a standard eye exam. In some cases, you may need blood tests, or imaging tests like a computerized tomography ( CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scan. With a CT scan, X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to make a more complete picture. And an MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images. If you haven't been diagnosed with Graves' disease, step one probably will be to get your thyroid hormone levels checked with a simple blood test. A number of things can help: Artificial tears, gels, and ointments can go a long way toward easing dryness. If you have a lot of swelling -- especially if it leads to double vision or loss of vision -- you might need to take a steroid called prednisone for a few weeks to bring the swelling down. In the rare cases when these don't work, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove some tissue from your eye socket or radiation therapy, where high-energy X-rays are aimed at the eye muscle. Graves' ophthalmopathy tends to get better after a few years, but you may have eye problems that need to be corrected with surgery. For example, you might need surgery to ease pain and pressure on your optic nerve, fix the alignment of your eye muscles, or make sure your eyelids cover and protect your eyes."
17,"After you've tried other treatments for Crohn's disease, your doctor may suggest drugs that target your immune system. Besides that, they can help prevent flare-ups. The goal is to ease inflammation in your gut. Inflammation is part of a complicated process that helps cause your Crohn's. Drugs that affect your immune system, and treatments like steroids and antibiotics, can treat that process. There are several reasons your doctor might want you to try immune system drugs to treat your Crohn's: Because other drugs don't work. Or your doctor may not want you to become too dependent on steroids to lower inflammation. To keep flares away. Immune system drugs can help keep your Crohn's symptoms from coming back. It may take up to 3 months before they take effect. To treat a fistula. This type of abnormal connection can go from one part of your intestine to another. It can also go from your digestive system to places like your bladder, vagina, anus, or skin. If you're having a flare, the doctor might combine one of these drugs with steroids to speed up treatment and ease your symptoms. You may hear your doctor refer to one type: immunomodulators. These affect your entire body, not just your gut. Some common ones are: Azathioprine ( Azasan, Imuran) Mercaptopurine ( Purinethol, Purixan) Methotrexate ( Trexall) Azathioprine and mercaptopurine can help keep flare-ups at bay. But they may take months to work. You might a need a faster-acting drug like a steroid until they do. Methotrexate can help when steroids or other drugs don't work anymore. Its side effects include: Nausea and diarrhea Fatigue Scarring of the liver if used long-term Your doctor may use these drugs aggressively to treat your symptoms. Then, he may switch you to other drugs for long-term treatment. You and your doctor can talk about which approach makes sense for you. These drugs also affect your immune system. But they focus just on parts of your immune system in your gut. Doctors use biologics if you have moderate to severe Crohn's that hasn't responded well to other medications. They also use them to treat open, draining fistulas in combination with antibiotics and other treatments. Some examples of biologics are: Adalimumab ( Humira) Adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), a biosimilar to Humira Adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita), also a biosimilar to Humira Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Infliximab ( Remicade) Infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), a biosimilar to Remicade Infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra), also a biosimilar to Remicade Natalizumab ( Tysabri) Ustekinumab ( Stelara) Vedolizumab ( Entyvio) In most cases, biologics cause fewer problems than other drugs used for Crohn's disease. In some instances, there can be serious side effects. Also, there is a risk for serious infections and certain types of cancer in people who take these drugs. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you. No matter which one your doctor prescribes, he'll watch you carefully. Before you take one of these drugs, let your doctor know if you have a heart condition or a disease that affects your nervous system. You may have side effects where you get the shot, such as: Redness Itching Bruising Pain Swelling Other possible side effects include: Headache, fever, or chills Trouble breathing Low blood pressure Hives or rash Stomach or back pain Nausea Cough and sore throat"
18,"Lots of people are allergic to the pollen that comes from grasses. It brings on symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, itchy eyes, and a cough. It's not just your lawn. There are hundreds of types of grasses. The kinds that often trigger allergies include: Bermuda Johnson Kentucky Orchard Redtop Rye Sweet vernal Timothy You may be allergic to only one type of grass or to many. Grasses tend to start growing in the early spring. In the late spring and early summer, they release pollen into the air. The wind can carry it for miles. Grass pollen is microscopic. You may not see it in the air. But if you're allergic, your body may react even to small amounts. Dry, windy days. Wind carries pollen in the air, especially when it's dry and sunny. When it's cold or damp, pollen counts are usually lower. Certain foods. If you're allergic to grasses, your symptoms are more likely to be triggered by particular fruits and vegetables that have proteins like those in pollen. Fresh celery, melons, peaches, oranges, and tomatoes may give you an itchy feeling in your mouth. Unmowed lawn. Most types of grass release pollen only when they grow tall. The pollen comes from a feathery flower that grows at the top. If you keep your lawn mowed, it's less likely to release pollen. But Bermuda grass and some other types can still release the sneezy stuff even if you keep it short. Get tested. It's the only way to know if you really are allergic to grasses, or if something else causes your symptoms. Avoid your triggers. Close windows on windy, summer days. Wear a mask when you garden. Rethink your lawn. It may seem drastic, but if you're sure that grasses in your yard are causing your symptoms, you could remove them. It might help to replace them with bunch grasses -- like perennial rye grass and tall fescue. These types don't flower and release pollen until they're 12 inches or taller. Other allergy-safe options for your yard include ivy (be careful, though, because it spreads) and Irish moss. Or you could landscape with other types of plants that will do well with the sun, soil, and water you usually get. You might even totally redo it, with a mix of flowers, trees, succulents (especially if you live in an area that often gets droughts), herbs, or vegetables. Treat it. Both over the counter and prescription medications can help ease or prevent allergy symptoms. Allergy shots or tablets or drops you take by mouth are another option that doctors call immunotherapy. It can ease, and sometimes end, your grass allergies."
19,"Managing stress in healthy ways may help reduce how often you have a genital herpes outbreak. Ongoing stress -- that lasting more than a week -- seems to trigger outbreaks more than any other lifestyle factor. Here are five steps you can take to manage stress better: Get enough sleep. The more rested you are, the better you will be able to handle stress. Most people need about eight hours of sleep every night to function normally. Some need less than that, others need more. Note how long you sleep when you don't set an alarm clock. If, for example, you go to sleep at 11 p.m. and wake up naturally and feeling well rested at 8 a.m., you probably need at least nine hours every night. Balance your diet. Make sure your diet includes all the nutrients the body needs to keep you going strong. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and limit the amount of sugary and fatty foods and soft drinks you consume. Also cut back on caffeine and alcohol if you tend to overindulge in those. Exercise . Physical activity is a great stress reliever. Do something that you enjoy so that it doesn't seem like a chore. For motivation, include a friend. That could mean playing a sport such as tennis, or having a partner to exercise with at the gym or walk or jog with. Reach out. When you're stressed, sometimes the last thing you want to do is socialize. But being with people and having fun can help you forget your troubles for a while. It's not healthy to dwell on them every minute. It's also good to talk about problems with someone who cares about you and whom you can trust -- a friend, a family member, a spouse, or even a therapist. Relax. In addition to all the above, a few minutes of downtime does a lot of good. You've probably heard about relaxation techniques, such as yoga or electronic biofeedback, but you don't have to do those things if listening to music, knitting, or just staring out the window is your idea of a relaxing break. Although persistent stress may lead to outbreaks, the little stressful events and daily annoyances you face do not appear to be stressful enough to trigger genital herpes symptoms. Other triggers of genital herpes may include: Sexual intercourse. Some people find that the friction of sexual intercourse irritates the skin and brings on symptoms. Using a water-based lubricant can help reduce irritation. Don't use one that contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9, however. Nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes, such as the lining of the vagina. Oil-based lubricants are a no-no, too. They weaken latex, making condoms more likely to break. Even if the friction of intercourse seems to be a trigger for symptoms, it probably won't cause a flare-up every time you have sex. Colds and sunlight. The common cold and sunlight seem to trigger outbreaks of oral herpes (cold sores), but no proof exists that they trigger genital herpes outbreaks. Hormones. Hormonal changes, like those that occur in the menstrual cycle, can affect genital herpes outbreaks. No one knows why. Surgery, weak immune system. Trauma to the body, such as having surgery, may make herpes symptoms appear. It's possible that having a weakened immune system does, too. People whose immune systems are weakened by HIV, for example, tend to have outbreaks more often than people with normal immune functioning. Remember that triggers may not be the same for everyone, and doctors are not certain how much lifestyle affects outbreaks of herpes symptoms. If you think something in particular triggers symptoms, ask your doctor what you should do about it."
20,"Breast cancer is a complex disease that's different for every woman. Before you start a treatment, your doctor will want to know the size of the tumor and how far it has spread in your body, called the stage of the cancer. There are five basic stages, 0 through IV, and a number of sub-stages. Staging is a way for doctors to describe your condition. It doesn't tell the whole story, though. Your doctor will think about many things before she recommends treatments for you, including: The type of breast cancer you have How fast it's growing Your age and how healthy you are If you've had breast cancer before If your tumor has female hormones or other genetic factors, such as the HER2 oncogene, that make it grow faster. If you know the stage of your breast cancer, you can use this quick guide to see what kinds of treatments might help. Stage 0 breast cancer is early stage cancer. Learn about its treatment options.

21,"There's a good reason why menopause is called âthe change of life.â It can affect just about every part of your body, including your breasts. During perimenopause -- the years before your periods stop -- you'll start to notice changes in the size and shape of your breasts. You may also notice that they feel tender and achy at unexpected times. Or they may be lumpier than they used to be. You'll want to know what's normal, what's not, and what helps. That knowledge empowers you to make a smooth midlife transition and feel your best during menopause and beyond. There are three common ways menopause and perimenopause can affect your breasts. 1. Tenderness or pain. Why It Happens: Before your period, fluid builds up in your breasts, making them feel more swollen, tender, or painful than other times of the month. Because the hormonal changes of perimenopause make your cycle irregular, breast soreness can strike unpredictably, according to the National Cancer Institute. What You Can Do About It: If your breasts hurt, wearing the right bra can make a big difference: 85% of women with breast pain gained relief when they wore a well-fitted sports bra, according to a 2014 study. The same researchers found that relaxation techniques or massaging achy breasts with over-the-counter pain creams was helpful for up to 60% of women. If breast pain is severe or won't go away, talk to your doctor. 2. Changes in breast size and shape Why It Happens: As you near menopause, your levels of estrogen drop dramatically. As your milk system starts to shut down, glandular tissue in your breasts shrinks. That causes them to become less dense and more fatty, which can lead to sagging. You may also notice that your breasts aren't as full as they used to be, and their size may change. What You Can Do About It: Time to hit the gym or invest in some hand-held weights! Although there's no proven way to reverse sagging, exercise makes your breasts look better by developing and toning the muscles underneath. Working out regularly also has another important perk: You'll be less likely to get breast cancer. Good ways to tone your chest muscles include pushups and lifting weights. Some lingerie styles, such as a pushup or underwire bra, can give you a youthful lift. For maximum boost and support, make sure your bra fits correctly: By some estimates, up 70% of women are wearing the wrong size. After menopause, you may need to go big when you shop for bras: A recent study found that 1 in 5 women went up a bra size after menopause (typically due to weight gain), but only 1 in 50 needed a smaller bra. 3. Lumpy Breasts Why It Happens: There are several reasons why this can happen during perimenopause, including normal aging and hormonal changes. Just like at any age, though, you'll need to see your doctor to find out what the lumps are. You could have cysts, fluid-filled sacs that are very common. They can feel like grapes and aren't cancerous. Many women, of all ages, have them. Sometimes they go away after menopause, but they can stick around, especially if you take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT). Fibrocystic changes are another common reason for lumpy, painful breasts and areas that feel rubbery to the touch. They don't make you more likely to get breast cancer. Nor do cysts. What You Can Do About It: Some women find when they cut down on caffeine, their breasts are less tender. You can also apply heat -- try a warm compress -- to the painful area or use over-the-counter pain relievers. Most midlife breast changes are normal. But you can't be sure on your own. Talk to your doctor if you notice any of these problems: A lump or a firm or thick area in your breast or under your arm. Nipple discharge fluid or changes, such as a nipple that becomes sunken into the breast, also called ""inverted."" Skin changes, such as redness, dimpling, puckering, or ridges that look like orange peel. Unexplained swelling or shrinkage of the breast, especially on one side only. Most of the time, breast changes are not cancer, but it's important to get any new or unusual symptom checked out quickly. Also talk to your doctor about how often you should get mammograms, since guidelines vary. The American Cancer Society recommends one every year, starting when you're 45. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering average-risk patients mammograms beginning at age 40. Other groups advise every 2 years when you turn 50 until you're 74. You may need to start sooner if you're at high risk. Your doctor can help you decide what's best for you."
22,"There's been a lot of research into it, but so far, doctors aren't sure of the exact cause of Parkinson's disease. They do know that if you have the illness, the trouble starts in some of your brain cells. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } In an area of your brain called the substantia nigra, cells that make the chemical dopamine start to die. Dopamine has an important job to do. It acts like a messenger that tells another area of your brain when you want to move a part of your body. When the cells that make dopamine start to die, your dopamine level drops. When it gets too low, you can't control your movements as well and you start to get Parkinson's symptoms. No one knows what triggers the death of those cells. Scientists think it's your genes and environment working off of each other in a way we don't understand. Your genes are like your body's instruction book. So if you get a change in one of them, it can make your body work in a slightly different way. Sometimes, that means you're more likely to get a certain disease. There are several changes to genes that can raise your risk for Parkinson's, each by a little bit. They have a part in about 1 in 10 cases. If you have one or more of these changes, it doesn't mean you'll get Parkinson's. Some people will, but many won't, and doctors don't know why. It may have to do with other genes or something in your environment. They can, but it's rare and only affects a small number of families. About 1 in 100 people with Parkinson's get it this way. Your environment is a hard one to pin down. Partly, that's because it covers a lot of ground. It's everything that's not your genes, which could mean where you live, what you eat, chemicals you've come into contact with, and more. Not only that, but it could take years for the effects from something in your environment to show up. So far, doctors have a lot of clues but no smoking gun. So you could have people who live or work in an area around chemicals tied to Parkinson's, but many of them don't get it. Some research shows links between Parkinson's and: Agent Orange, a chemical used to destroy trees and crops in the Vietnam War. Certain chemicals used in farming, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Some metals and chemicals used in factories, such as manganese, lead, and trichlorethylene ( TCE). These can come into play based on where you live, what you do for work, or if you served in the military. Sometimes, these chemicals seep into well water, so that's one more way they can affect you. It's a complex picture, but you may be more likely to get Parkinson's based on: Age. Since it mostly affects people 60 and older, your risk goes up as the years go by. Family history. If your parent, brother, or sister has it, you're a little more likely to get it. Job. Some types of work, like farming or factory jobs, can cause you to have contact with chemicals linked to Parkinson's. Race. It shows up more often in white people than other groups. Serious head injury. If you hit your head hard enough to lose consciousness or forget things as a result of it, you may be more likely to get Parkinson's later in life. Gender. Men get it more than women. Doctors aren't sure why. Where you live. People in rural areas seem to get it more often, which may be tied to chemicals used in farming. As scientists try to learn what's at the root of Parkinson's, they're looking far and wide to pick up clues where they can. They've found that people with Parkinson's tend to have something called Lewy bodies in their brain. These are unusual clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein itself is normal, but the clumps are not. And they're found in parts of the brain that affect sleep and sense of smell, which could explain some symptoms of Parkinson's not related to movement. Your gut may also have a part in it, as some of its cells make dopamine, too. Some doctors think that this might be where the earliest signs of Parkinson's show up, but that idea needs more research."
23,"If you have sickle cell disease, your red blood cells aren't round and stretchy like they should be. Instead, they're stiff and sticky. They're also shaped like a crescent or a sickle and get wedged in small blood vessels. That makes it harder for your blood to carry oxygen through your body, which can leave you tired, in pain, out of breath, and more likely to pick up infections. Sickle cell disease can affect different organs and parts of your body. The best way to manage your condition is to see your doctor or hematologist as early as possible and to stick with your treatments for the long term. When your red blood cells get trapped in your vessels, they not only cut off oxygen but can set off bouts of great pain. It's called a sickle cell crisis. You might get relief with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Drinking lots of fluids helps, too. You can also try: A heating pad or hot baths Massage Acupuncture Relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation If you're in severe pain, you may need to go to a hospital for a day or more. You can get stronger painkillers and fluids directly into a vein. A medicine called hydroxyurea ( Droxia, Hydrea, Sikos) prevents abnormal red blood cells from forming. This cuts down on episodes of sickle cell crises. Hydroxyurea can cause serious side effects, like a plunge in the number of white blood cells that help your body fight infections. So your doctor will watch you closely while you're on it. You shouldn't take hydroxyurea if you're pregnant. Your doctor may prescribe a newer drug called L-glutamine oral powder ( Endari). It can cut down on your trips to the hospital for pain and also guard against a condition called acute chest syndrome. If you have long-term pain, your doctor might prescribe one of these medicines: Amitriptyline Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Gabapentin ( Horizant, Gralise, Neurontin) Opioid pain medicine It's a serious condition that can land you in the hospital. It happens when you don't have enough red blood cells to move oxygen throughout your body. One way to treat anemia is with a blood transfusion. You'll get healthy red blood cells from a donor whose blood has been screened for infections and matched to your type and needs. Your doctor will pick one of several ways to do it: Simple transfusion. The normal red blood cells from your donor's blood are separated from the rest of the blood. The new red blood cells are added to your own blood through an IV in your arm, or a port if you have one. This usually takes about 4 hours. Exchange transfusion. You replace some of your whole blood with healthy donor cells. Your blood can be drawn before or at the same time as your transfusion, with an IV or a line in each arm. Sickle cells can damage your spleen, the organ that helps fight germs as part of your immune system. That can make you more likely to get pneumonia and other infections. Children with sickle cell disease should take penicillin from ages 2 months to 5 years. Some adults will also need to take antibiotics, including those who've had their spleen removed. If you catch an infection and your fever is over 101 F, you'll need to get treated with antibiotics right away. You may have to stay in a hospital overnight or longer. Vaccines can protect you and your child against germs. Everyone with sickle cell disease should get these vaccines: Pneumococcus: both the PCV13 and PPSV 23 vaccines Flu vaccine every year Meningococcus Your doctor will also advise you about other vaccines that may be right for you or your child, including: Hepatitis A and B Measles, mumps, and rubella Varicella (chickenpox) Rotavirus Haemophilus influenzae Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis Poliovirus When sickle cells get stuck in the larger arteries that feed the brain, they can block blood flow and cause a stroke. You can preventfrequent transfusions can lower the odds of another stroke by about 90% If you think you're having a stroke, call 911 right away. You may need a rapid exchange transfusion. If your child has sickle cell disease, your doctor will do an ultrasound test to measure blood flow to the brain and to check for stroke risk. They're the only way to cure sickle cell disease. Stem cells are immature cells in your bone marrow that grow into new red or white blood cells and platelets (cells that help form blood clots). Transplants are usually done in children under age 16 who've had sickle cell complications like pain and strokes. Your child first gets strong chemotherapy drugs to destroy her bone marrow and damaged red blood cells. Then, she gets healthy bone marrow or stem cells from another person. Her bone marrow then will start to make healthy red blood cells. Older people don't get transplants as often because they're more likely to have complications."
24,"There's a lot of incorrect info out there about schizophrenia. Some of it is spread by movies or TV shows. Or sometimes people use stereotypes when talking about this mental illness. Get the real story behind some common myths. Myth No. 1: It means you have multiple personalities. This is one of the biggest misunderstandings about schizophrenia. One poll found that 64% of Americans believe the condition involves a split personality, which means someone acts like they're two separate people. A person with schizophrenia doesn't have two different personalities. Instead, he has false ideas or has lost touch with reality. Multiple personality disorder is unrelated. Myth No. 2: Most people with schizophrenia are violent or dangerous. In movies and TV shows, who is the crazed killer? Often it's the character with this condition. That's not the case in real life. Even though people with schizophrenia can act unpredictably at times, most aren't violent, especially if they're getting treated. When people with this brain disorder do commit violent acts, they usually have another condition, like childhood conduct problems or substance abuse. Myth No. 3: Bad parenting is the cause. Mothers, in particular, often get blamed. But schizophrenia is a mental illness. It has many causes, including genes, trauma, and drug abuse. Mistakes you've made as a parent won't give your child this condition. Myth No. 4: If your parent has schizophrenia, you'll get it too. Genes do play a role. But just because one of your parents has this mental illness doesn't mean you're destined to get it. If one parent has schizophrenia, your risk of getting the condition is about 10%. Having more than one family member with it raises your risk. Myth No. 5: People with schizophrenia aren't smart. Some studies have that found that people with the condition have more trouble on tests of mental skills such as attention, learning, and memory. But that doesn't mean they're not intelligent. Many creative and smart people throughout history have had schizophrenia, such as Russian ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky and Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash. Scientists are even looking into links between genes that may be related to both psychosis and creativity. Myth No. 6: If you have schizophrenia, you belong in a mental hospital. There was a time when people with mental illnesses were sent to asylums or even prisons. But now that experts know more about this disease, fewer people need to be placed in long-term mental health facilities. Most people with schizophrenia live with family or in supportive housing in the community. Myth No. 7: You can't hold a job if you have it. Schizophrenia can make it harder for you to land a job and go to work every day. But with the right treatment, many people can find a position that fits their skills and abilities. Myth No. 8: Schizophrenia makes people lazy. The illness can make it harder for someone to take care of their daily needs, such as dressing and bathing. This doesn't mean they're ""lazy."" They just need some help with their daily routine. Myth No. 9: You can never recover from it. Schizophrenia can be hard to treat, but it's not impossible. With the right medicine and therapy, about 25% of people with this disease will recover completely. Another 50% will see some improvement in their symptoms. Many people with the condition can live full, productive lives."
25,"Let's start with the basics. Antacids neutralize excess stomach acid to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, acid indigestion, and stomach upset. They are sometimes prescribed in addition to other meds to help relieve the pain of stomach and duodenal ulcers. Some antacids also contain simethicone, an ingredient that helps eliminate excess gas. You should take antacids exactly as directed by your doctor, or according to the manufacturer's directions. For stomach or duodenal ulcers, take the medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. If you are using the tablets, chew them well before swallowing for faster relief. Serious side effects can occur with an overdose or overuse of antacids. Side effects include constipation, diarrhea, change in the color of bowel movements, and stomach cramps. Products containing calcium may cause kidney stones and are more likely to cause constipation. Products like famotidine ( Pepcid- AC) are called histamine-2 blockers or H2 blockers. These drugs reduce production of stomach acid. Pepcid AC and other H2 blockers, such as ranitidine ( Zantac 75) are available in prescription-strength or in lower doses in over-the-counter varieties. These products are for relief of heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach, and other conditions, such as stomach ulcers. Another type of heartburn medication, known as proton pump inhibitors, may be used when antacids or H2 blockers fail. PPIs block the secretion of acid from the stomach. Prilosec (omeprazole), Lansoprazole ( Prevacid), and esomeprazole ( Nexium 24 HR) can be bought over the counter. Pantoprazole ( Protonix), rabeprazole ( Aciphex), dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant), and esomeprazole ( Nexium) are examples of other PPIs that are available only by prescription. PPIs generally cause few side effects, but they do interact with other common drugs such as warfarin ( Coumadin), some heart medications and antibiotics, so it is important to review all medications with your doctor. Antacids work the quickest to relieve occasional heartburn. For patients who do not respond to antacids, H2 blockers and PPIs are alternatives. Remember, though, that frequent or severe episodes of reflux should always be discussed with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to take antacids when you start taking H2 blockers to help control your symptoms until the H2 blocker takes effect. If your doctor prescribes an antacid, take it an hour before or an hour after H2 blockers. Take H2 blockers regularly for as long as directed by your doctor, even if you do not have any pain or your symptoms improve. Possible serious side effects that need to be reported to your doctor right away include confusion, chest tightness, bleeding, sore throat, fever, irregular heartbeat, weakness, and unusual fatigue. Other less serious side effects include mild headache, dizziness, and diarrhea, which are usually temporary and will likely go away on their own. Occasional heartburn is common and generally not serious. However, prolonged heartburn can be a symptom of a serious problem, such as esophagitis. Esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of the esophagus, the food tube. Esophagitis occurs when stomach acid repeatedly comes into contact with the lining of the esophagus. If esophagitis is severe, the person can develop Barrett's esophagus and even cancer. Over time, this condition can narrow the passageway from the esophagus to the stomach. Your husband should consult his doctor for further evaluation. When a person requires more than twice-weekly over-the-counter drugs for heartburn, a doctor should be consulted. An endoscopy to visualize his esophagus may also be recommended. A hernia is the pressing of an organ through an opening in the muscle wall of the cavity that protects it. With a hiatal hernia, a portion of the stomach pushes through the hole where the esophagus and the stomach join. The most common cause of a hiatal hernia is an increase in pressure on the abdominal cavity. Pressure can come from coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, heavy lifting, or physical strain. Pregnancy, obesity, or excess fluid in the abdomen also can cause hiatal hernias. A hiatal hernia can develop in people of all ages and both sexes, although it frequently affects middle-aged people. In fact, the majority of otherwise healthy people over age 50 have small hiatal hernias. Many people with a hiatal hernia never have any symptoms. In some people, acid and digestive juices escape from the stomach into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). This causes: Heartburn A bitter or sour taste in the back of the throat Bloating and belching Discomfort or pain in the stomach or esophagus Vomiting Most hiatal hernias do not cause problems and rarely need treatment. Successful treatment of hiatal hernias usually involves treating the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) that are triggered by the additional pressure in the abdomen. Treatment includes: Making lifestyle changes, such as: Losing weight, if you are overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight Having a common-sense approach to eating, such as eating moderate to small portions of foods, and limiting fatty foods, acidic foods (such as tomatoes and citrus fruits or juices), foods containing caffeine, and alcoholic beverages Eating meals at least three to four hours before lying down and avoiding bedtime snacks Elevating the head of your bed by 6 inches (this helps allow gravity to keep the stomach contents in the stomach) Not smoking Wearing looser clothing, especially around the waistline Taking medications, such as over-the-counter antacids or H2 blockers or PPIs. Note: If you take over-the-counter drugs and see no improvement or take them for longer than two weeks, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe a stronger medication. If medications and lifestyle changes are not effective in treating your symptoms, diagnostic tests may be performed to determine if surgery is necessary. People with a hiatal hernia who also have severe, chronic esophageal reflux may need surgery to correct the problem if their symptoms are not relieved through these management techniques. Surgery may also be needed to reduce the size of the hernia if it is in danger of becoming constricted or strangulated (so that the blood supply is cut off). During surgery, gastroesophageal reflux is corrected by pulling the hiatal hernia back into the abdomen and creating an improved valve mechanism at the bottom of the esophagus. The surgeon wraps the upper part of the stomach (called the fundus) around the lower portion of the esophagus. This creates a tighter sphincter so that food will not reflux back into the esophagus. Hiatal hernia surgery can be performed either by opening the abdominal cavity or laparoscopically. During laparoscopic surgery, five or six small (5 to 10 millimeter) incisions are made in the abdomen. The laparoscope and surgical instruments are inserted through these incisions. The surgeon is guided by the laparoscope, which transmits a picture of the internal organs on a monitor. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery include smaller incisions, less risk of infection, less pain and scarring, and a more rapid recovery. More than half of all pregnant women report heartburn, particularly during their third trimester. Heartburn occurs during pregnancy, in part, because your digestive system works more slowly due to changing hormone levels. Also, your enlarged uterus can crowd your stomach, pushing stomach acids upward. Here are some ways you can reduce your heartburn during pregnancy: Eat several small meals each day instead of three large ones. Eat slowly. Avoid fried, spicy, or rich foods, or any foods that seem to increase your heartburn. Don't lie down directly after eating. Keep the head of your bed higher than the foot of your bed. Ask your doctor about trying over-the-counter heartburn relievers such as Tums or Maalox. If your heartburn persists, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe drugs that are safe to take during pregnancy. What's on your plate can impact heartburn, GERD, and Barrett's esophagus. Eating certain foods, including onions, peppermint, and high-fat foods, as well as drinking alcohol, can cause the lower esophageal sphincter muscle, which controls the opening between the esophagus and the stomach, to relax. Usually, this muscle remains tightly closed except when food is swallowed. However, when this muscle fails to close, the acid-containing contents of the stomach can travel back up into the esophagus, producing a burning sensation commonly referred to as heartburn. Caffeinated beverages and foods (such as coffee, tea, colas, and chocolate) can also aggravate heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD). Tomatoes, citrus fruits, or juices also contribute additional acid that can irritate the esophagus. In addition, smoking relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, contributing to heartburn and GERD. Improving your eating habits can also reduce reflux. After eating, keep an upright posture. Eat moderate portions of food and smaller meals. Lastly, eat meals at least three to four hours before lying down, and avoid bedtime snacks. Barrett's esophagus is a change in the lining of the lower esophagus that develops in some people who have chronic GERD or inflammation of the esophagus. The symptoms of Barrett's esophagus are the same as those of GERD, although often more severe. These symptoms include a burning sensation under the chest and acid regurgitation. These symptoms generally decrease with drugs that reduce acid in the stomach. Some people with Barrett's esophagus may not have any symptoms at all. The only way to confirm the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is with a test called an upper endoscopy. This involves inserting a small, lighted tube (endoscope) through the throat and into the esophagus to look for a change in the lining of the esophagus. While the appearance of the esophagus may suggest Barrett's esophagus, the diagnosis can only be confirmed with small samples of tissue (biopsy) obtained through the endoscope. The treatment of Barrett's esophagus is similar to the treatment of reflux. This includes lifestyle changes, such as avoiding certain foods and eating late in the evening, smoking cessation, and wearing loose-fitting clothing, along with using medications that will decrease acid production by the stomach. Patients with Barrett's esophagus typically need PPI drugs to reduce acid. Barrett's esophagus may lead to the development of cancer of the esophagus in some patients, although this risk is smaller than once thought. Up to 0.5% of those with Barrett's esophagus will develop esophageal cancer each year. Esophageal cancer develops through a sequence of changes in the cells of the esophagus known as dysplasia. Dysplasia can only be detected by a biopsy. Patients with Barrett's esophagus should talk to their doctors about having regular screening exams to detect cancer at an early and potentially curable stage. Studies are in progress to develop a more effective treatment for Barrett's esophagus. One treatment, known as ablation therapy, removes the abnormal cells with heat or laser light. Other new treatments are also under development."
26,"The palms of your hands and soles of your feet make up less than 5% of the skin on your body. That's a pretty small area, but you use them all the time, every day. If they're inflamed with psoriasis, simple tasks can become hard to do. With the right treatment, you can control your symptoms and get relief for your hands, feet, and nails. What Are The Causes? One type of hand and foot psoriasis is called pustular psoriasis. It gets its name from the whitish-yellow blisters, or pustules, it causes. The blisters are not contagious, but they can be painful. They can show up anywhere on your body, but mostly on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. They can be triggered by: Some medications Irritation from creams or ointments Too much UV light Pregnancy Steroids Infections Stress Stopping medication quickly If you smoke, you're more likely to get pustular psoriasis. It's more common in adults than children, and women tend to get it more than men. What Does It Look Like? The skin on your hands and feet becomes red, and then blisters appear. You can also get scales around the blisters. Your palms and soles can swell, crack, and bleed. Pressure or rubbing on your hands and feet -- like from shoes that don't fit -- can make the problem worse. After the blisters burst, they might dry up or make your skin crusty and brown. How Do I Treat My Flare- Up? Because you use your hands and feet so much, treatment can be a challenge. The condition can affect your ability to walk, button a shirt, hold a pencil, and do many other regular things. It's best if you act quickly and do what you can to prevent flares. Start with a visit to your doctor as soon you notice symptoms. She'll try different options until she finds the one that's right for you. Some treatments are: Medicines that go on your skin Prescription drugs in liquid or pill form Special light therapy units for palms and soles Biologic drugs that you get through an IV or as an injection Your doctor may also recommend you use super glue to seal cracks in your palms and soles. It's important to make sure you don't have an allergy to the glue before trying it. Keep your skin moisturized with lotion and drink plenty of water. When it's dry it cracks more easily, which can lead to more blisters. Skin that's hydrated can also take in on-the-skin treatment better and heal faster. Can It Affect My Nails? Half of all people with psoriasis have it on their nails. If you have psoriatic arthritis, you're even more likely to have symptoms there. Psoriasis can affect your nails in many ways. It can: Change the color or shape Make dents Make them thick with scale under the nail plate Chip or split Make it easier for them to fall off or lift away from the nail bed Be painful to touch Make small pits on the surface What Can I Do for My Nails? Psoriasis affects them as they're forming, which can make it tricky to treat. In some cases, you can use an ointment to take care of a flare-up on your skin, but your thickened nail may keep those treatments from sinking in to the problem area. Instead, your doctor may recommend: Corticosteroid shots Scraping or filing the nail Removing the nails Light therapy Sometimes it goes away on its own, with no treatment. Take some steps to keep your nails safe: Keep them short. Cover loose nails with a bandage or gloves (not latex). Don't bite your nails or use them to open things. Everyday things you do for your overall health help, too. Eat well, exercise, and keep your stress levels low. All these things help your psoriasis treatments work better, so you're less likely to have a flare."
27,"Some types of dermatitis are easier to prevent than others. Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis can be prevented by avoiding skin contact with the agents that cause the dermatitis. However, if you come into contact with an irritant, such as poison ivy, wash the exposed skin with soap and water as soon as possible (and all exposed clothing such as gloves and boots so that you don't get re-exposed to the poison ivy resin). Most other types of dermatitis develop in people with sensitive skin and can be prevented only by avoiding the irritant. If you feel you are at risk for dermatitis, consider these preventive steps: Use a humidifier at home and at work to keep the air from getting too dry. Wear loose-fitting, natural-fiber clothing; untreated cotton is ideal. Avoid plated jewelry, especially in your ears, to prevent nickel-related rashes. Surgical steel or 14-karat gold earring posts are safer choices. Don't wear a watchband that presses against your skin for long periods; the friction and sweat buildup can cause rashes. Take warm, not hot, baths or showers and use mild soaps. Lubricate your skin after a bath and several times during the day when possible using an unscented lotion or cream."
28,"Bursitis is the inflammation or irritation of the bursa. The bursa is a sac filled with lubricating fluid, located between tissues such as bone, muscle, tendons, and skin, that decreases rubbing, friction, and irritation. Bursitis is most often caused by repetitive, minor impact on the area, or from a sudden, more serious injury. Age also plays a role. As tendons age they are able to tolerate stress less, are less elastic, and are easier to tear. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Overuse or injury to the joint at work or play can also increase a person's risk of bursitis. Examples of high-risk activities include gardening, raking, carpentry, shoveling, painting, scrubbing, tennis, golf, skiing, throwing, and pitching. Incorrect posture at work or home and poor stretching or conditioning before exercise can also lead to bursitis. An abnormal or poorly placed bone or joint (such as length differences in your legs or arthritis in a joint) can put added stress on a bursa sac, causing bursitis. Stress or inflammation from other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, thyroid disorders, or unusual medication reactions may also increase a person's risk. In addition, an infection can occasionally lead to inflammation of a bursa. Bursitis is more common in adults, especially in those over 40 years of age. Elbow Shoulder Hip Knee Achilles tendon The most common symptom of bursitis is pain. The pain may build up gradually or be sudden and severe, especially if calcium deposits are present. Severe loss of motion in the shoulder -- called ""adhesive capsulitis"" or frozen shoulder -- can also result from the immobility and pain associated with shoulder bursitis. If you are planning to start exercising, you will be less likely to get bursitis if you gradually build up force and repetitions. Stop what you are doing if unusual pain occurs. Bursitis can be treated in a number of ways, including: Avoiding activities that aggravate the problem Resting the injured area Icing the area the day of the injury Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines If the condition does not improve in a week, see your doctor. Your doctor can also prescribe drugs to reduce the inflammation. Corticosteroids, also known simply as ""steroids,"" are often used because they work quickly to decrease the inflammation and pain. Steroids can be injected directly at the site of injury. Injections are often, but not always, effective and can be repeated . However, multiple injections in a several month period are usually avoided due to potential side effects from the injections and the possibility of masking problems that need to be treated differently. Physical therapy is another treatment option that is often used. This includes range-of-motion exercises and splinting (thumb, forearm, or bands). Surgery, although rarely needed, may be an option when bursitis does not respond to the other treatment options. Consult your doctor if you have: Fever (over 102 Fahrenheit) -- infection is a possibility Swelling, redness, and warmth General illness or multiple sites of pain Inability to move the affected area These could be signs of another problem that needs more immediate attention."
29,"Most people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) have a type called relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS). It usually starts in your 20s or 30s. If you have RRMS, you may have attacks when your symptoms flare up. These are called relapses. An attack is followed by a time of recovery when you have few or no symptoms, called remission. It can last weeks, months, or longer. The disease doesn't get worse during these breaks. After 10 to 20 years, RRMS usually changes to a different type of MS called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. You won't have relapses as often, but the disease gets gradually worse. No two people with MS are likely to have the same symptoms in the same way. Some may come and go or appear once and not again. The symptoms you have depend on the area of your brain or spinal cord that the disease has damaged. They can include: Eye pain and vision problems such as double vision or jumpy vision. These problems may be the first sign you have RRMS. Numbness and tingling Sensitivity to heat Pain that runs down the spine, like a mild electrical shock, when you bend your neck Dizziness Bowel or bladder problems Sexual problems, like trouble getting aroused or climaxing Stiff muscles and trouble moving your body Feeling weak and tired Problems with balance and coordination A hard time thinking clearly Depression An RRMS attack can last anywhere from 24 hours to several weeks. It can involve: One or many symptoms An existing problem that gets worse A new symptom Tell your doctor about signs of a relapse as soon as possible. If you treat it quickly, you might be able to reduce lasting damage and disability. Most people with RRMS manage the disease with: Medication Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other forms of rehab Healthy habits For most people with RRMS, it's best to start treatment as soon as they're diagnosed to avoid lasting nerve damage. Some medications for RRMS fight the disease by turning down the body's immune system so that it doesn't attack nerves. These are called disease-modifying drugs ( DMDs). Doctors might also call them immunotherapy or disease-modifying therapy ( DMT). These drugs make relapses happen less often and make them less severe. They may keep the disease from getting worse for a while. You can take some DMDs by injection. These drugs include: Glatiramer ( Copaxone) Interferon beta-1a ( Avonex, Rebif) Interferon beta-1b ( Betaseron) Peginterferon beta -1a ( Plegridy) You'll need to take some DMDs through an IV at a clinic or hospital. These include: Alemtuzumab ( Lemtrada) Mitoxantrone ( Novantrone) Natalizumab ( Tysabri) Ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus) Three types of DMDs come in pill form. They are: Dimethyl fumarate ( Tecfidera) Fingolimod ( Gilenya) Teriflunomide ( Aubagio) DMDs have side effects. You and your doctor will weigh the pros and cons of each drug. And your doctor will watch your symptoms closely during treatment. The symptom flares of RRMS happen when the brain and spinal cord get inflamed. Reducing the inflammation is key to treating a relapse. Mild flares may not need treatment. If you have severe symptoms, your doctor may recommend steroids. You can take some of these medications through an IV and others by mouth. A short-term, high-dose course of steroids can help: Reduce inflammation Make the relapse shorter and less severe Your doctor may prescribe other types of drugs to treat different RRMS symptoms. For example, you might take: Antidepressants Pain relievers Drugs to fight fatigue A healthy lifestyle is an important way to feel your best. Be sure to: Eat a nutritious diet Keep a healthy weight It's also important to be active when you have MS. Exercise can help you: Stay mobile Control your weight Boost your mood and energy levels Try different types of exercise, including activities to get your heart pumping, like walking or swimming, and moves that strengthen your muscles and stretch your body. When you make an exercise plan, keep in mind: Start slowly, even with 5 to 10 minutes of activity. Avoid getting overheated if you are sensitive to temperature. Ask a physical therapist to help you build an exercise program."
30,"Psychotherapy -- or ""talk therapy"" -- is an effective treatment for clinical depression. On its own, it may not be enough to treat severe depression. But it can play an important role when used with other treatments, including medications. It's used to help the person find ways to deal with everyday stressors. It can also encourage you to use your medications properly. Many studies support the idea that therapy can be a powerful treatment for depression. Some, although not all, have also found that combining depression medicine with therapy can be very effective. A large-scale trial involving more than 400 people with treatment-resistant depression found that talk therapy alongside medication made symptoms easier to take. There are a number of them: It can help ease stress. It can give you a new perspective on problems. It can make it easier to stick to your treatment. You can use it to learn how to deal with side effects from your medicine You learn ways to talk to other people about your condition. It helps catch early signs that your depression is getting worse. Cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy focus on how your own thoughts and behaviors contribute to your depression. Your therapist will help you learn ways to react to things and challenge your preconceptions. You and your therapist might come up with goals. You might also get ""homework"" assignments, like to keep a journal or apply problem-solving techniques in particular situations. Interpersonal therapy focuses on how your relationships with others play a role in your depression. It focuses on practical issues. You will learn how to spot unhealthy behaviors and change them. Psychodynamic therapy is more traditional. You and your therapist explore behavior patterns and motivations that you may not be aware of which could contribute to depression. You may focus on any traumas from your childhood. Individual counseling is a one-on-one session with a professional therapist who might be an MD (psychiatrist/doctor), Ph D (psychologist), Psy D (psychologist), LCSW (licensed clinical social worker), or NP (nurse practitioner), with experience in treating depression and other mood disorders. Your therapist can teach you more about depression and help you understand yours. You can discuss new strategies to manage stress and to keep your depression from getting worse or coming back. One-on-one sessions can help you identify specific stresses and triggers that worsen your depression. A therapist can help you work through issues at home or at work, and encourage you to maintain healthy connections with family and friends. Your therapist can also help you adopt good habits, like making sure you take your medicines, seeing your doctor regularly, and getting enough sleep. Family counseling treats the entire family -- because it's not only the person with the diagnosis who is affected by depression. If you're depressed, your family feels it, too. And unfortunately, although family members may have the best of intentions, without professional guidance, they sometimes make things worse. Family therapy is a great way for your relatives to learn about depression and the early warning signs. Studies suggest that family sessions might really help with treatment, too, improving lifestyle, compliance with medication, and sleep habits. It also lets you and your family members talk about the stresses of life with depression. You may all feel more comfortable talking openly with a therapist there to guide the conversation. Group counseling sessions give you a chance to meet other people who are going through the same things you are. You can share experiences and strategies. The give-and-take is often a good way to learn new ways to think about your illness. You will want to find a qualified therapist -- usually a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, psychiatric nurse, or counselor. If possible, find one who has expertise with treatment-resistant depression. Ask your doctor for recommendations. Or get in touch with an organization like the National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI) or the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance ( DBSA). While some people may benefit from short-term therapy, people with longstanding or treatment-resistant depression tend to derive more benefit from longer-term psychotherapy . Studies show long-term therapy for those conditions leads to greater improvement in depression symptoms and better life satisfaction and social functioning. It may also lower the risk of relapse after you get better. You and your therapist can watch for signs your depression might be getting worse. Over time, you'll also learn about the patterns in your life that may trigger feelings of depression. If you have treatment-resistant depression, you may have already tried therapy. Maybe you didn't feel like it worked. But it may be time to give it a second chance. Here are some things to consider before you try again: Think about the reasons you didn't find therapy useful in the past. Why didn't it work? What did you need from therapy that you weren't getting? Decide what you want out of therapy now. Do you want to tackle specific problems? Do you want to work through upsetting events from your past? Come up with goals. Consider going back to your old therapist. Even if therapy didn't work last time, that doesn't mean the therapist was at fault. The experience may be different if you approach it with specific goals this time. Going back to a previous therapist may be easier, since they'll already know your history and situation. Consider trying someone new. Make sure that the therapist you're seeing has training and expertise in psychotherapy forms that are specific to the treatment of depression. Make sure you you like and respect your therapist. Ask yourself if you feel you can both work together effectively . If you and your therapist don't ""click,"" therapy is unlikely to work. So you could try someone new. You might even want to meet with a few therapists before choosing one. Ask about their approaches. Talk about your goals. Give it time. Once you've settled on a therapist, give therapy a chance to work. Don't give up after a few sessions. Like with depression medicine, therapy can take time before you feel the benefits."

However, many people do not have side effects from taking hypertension drugs, and often the side effects are mild. Still, it's important to stay informed and work closely with your doctor to manage any side effects you may have. There's no reason to ""suffer in silence."" Today there are more medication options than ever for managing high blood pressure (hypertension). This article lists the side effects that may be caused by each type of high blood pressure drug. First, here are four general warnings. Never stop taking medication without first talking to your doctor. In some cases, this can be very dangerous, causing a big spike in blood pressure. If you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about the safest medication to use. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs) can cause harmful side effects for pregnant women and their developing babies. If you take insulin for diabetes, talk to your doctor. Changes in blood sugar can occur in people with diabetes taking diuretics or beta-blockers for high blood pressure. If you have problems with erections during sex, talk with your doctor. Some high blood pressure medications can cause this problem. Reducing the dose or changing to another type of medication may help. But high blood pressure itself can also cause erectile dysfunction. As an informed patient, read about the type of medication you are taking and its possible side effects. You can find a full list on your medication insert. To get you started, here is an overview of the most common side effects of high blood pressure medications. Diuretics These high blood pressure medications flush extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. Diuretics may cause these side effects: Extra urination. Extra water out means more time in the bathroom. Take these medications earlier in the day and when you're not far away from a bathroom. Erection problems in some men Weakness, leg cramps, or fatigue. Diuretics may decrease the body's levels of the mineral potassium, which can lead to these side effects. Certain potassium-sparing diuretics do not have this effect, however. Intense and sudden foot pain, which is a symptom of gout; this is rare. Beta- Blockers Beta-blockers make your heart beat less forcefully and more slowly. These medications may cause side effects such as: Asthma symptoms Cold hands and feet Depression Erection problems Insomnia and sleep problems Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE) Inhibitors These high blood pressure medications block formation of a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow, so vessels relax. ACE inhibitors may cause these side effects: A dry, hacking cough that doesn't go away. If you have this side effect, the doctor may prescribe another type of medication. Skin rash and a loss of taste are two other possible side effects of ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers ( ARBs) These high blood pressure medications shield blood vessels from a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow. This allows blood vessels to stay open. One of the more common side effects of ARBs is dizziness. Calcium Channel Blockers ( CCBs) These high blood pressure medications keep calcium from entering heart muscle and blood vessel cells. Blood vessels can then relax. CCBs may cause these side effects: Constipation Dizziness Headache Irregular or very rapid heartbeat (palpitations) Swollen ankles Alpha- Blockers Alpha-blockers reduce nerve impulses to blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily. These medications may cause: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness when standing up suddenly or getting up in the morning (from reduced blood pressure) Fast heart rate Alpha-2 Receptor Agonist This high blood pressure medication decreases activity in the adrenaline-producing part of the nervous system. It may cause drowsiness or dizziness. Alpha- Beta- Blockers These high blood pressure medications reduce nerve impulses and also slow the heartbeat. Patients with severe high blood pressure often receive them by intravenous ( IV) injection. But the doctor may also prescribe these medications for people who have congestive heart failure. Alpha-beta blockers may cause a drop in blood pressure when you stand up suddenly or first get up in the morning. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness. Central Agonists These high blood pressure medications control nerve impulses, relaxing blood vessels. Central agonists may cause: Anemia Constipation Dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness when standing up suddenly or getting up in the morning (from a drop in blood pressure) Drowsiness Dry mouth Erection problems Fever Peripheral Adrenergic Inhibitors This type of medication blocks neurotransmitters in the brain, so the message to constrict doesn't reach smooth muscles. Used less often than other high blood pressure medications, these drugs can cause: Diarrhea Dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness when standing up suddenly or getting up in the morning (from reduced blood pressure) Erection problems Heartburn Stuffy nose If nightmares or insomnia persist, talk with your doctor about another HBP medication option. Vasodilators Vasodilators relax muscles in vessel walls, opening blood vessels and allowing blood to flow better. These medications may cause: Excessive hair growth Fluid retention Headaches Irregular or very rapid heartbeat (palpitations) Joint aches and pains Swelling around the eyes Renin Inhibitor This newer class of high blood pressure medication works by decreasing chemicals that tighten blood vessels. This medication may be used alone or in combination with another medication. Side effects may include: Cough Diarrhea or stomach pain Heartburn Rash Partner with your doctor. Ask if there are any take steps you can take to lessen medication side effects. For example, to lessen the effects of low blood pressure, it may help to avoid standing for a long time in the sun. In some cases, side effects such as fatigue or diarrhea may subside with time. In other cases, your doctor may change the dosage or prescribe another high blood pressure medication. A combination of medications sometimes works better than one medication alone by not only improving high blood pressure control but also by reducing side effects. Also, when you first start a new high blood pressure medicine, be aware of rare allergic reactions. Call 911 right away if you develop hives, wheezing, vomiting, light-headedness, or swelling in your throat or face."
32,"Stress tests measure the amount of stress your heart can manage before it beats in an irregular rhythm or affects your blood flow. The exercise stress test is the one doctors use most often, including for people who have diabetes. Also called an exercise electrocardiogram, treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ECG, an exercise stress test can tell your doctor how well your heart handles physical activity. You typically walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while your doctor watches your heart rate and blood pressure. Your doctor uses this test to: See if your heart gets enough blood when you're physically active See how likely you are to have coronary heart disease Check for abnormal heart rhythms Find out how well your heart medications are working or see if any procedures you've had done have improved the blood flow in your heart vessels Help figure out a safe exercise program for you Your doctor will give you specific instructions on what to do before your stress test. If you have diabetes, ask them if you should take your medication before the test. If you take insulin to control your blood sugar, ask your doctor how much medication you should take the day of the test and if you should eat a light meal. If you take pills to control your blood sugar, you may be told to wait and take your medication after the test. If you have a glucose monitor, bring it with you to check your blood sugar levels before and after your exercise stress test. If you think your blood sugar is low, tell the lab technician right away. Other instructions may include: Don't drink or eat foods with caffeine for 24 hours before the test. Caffeine can affect the results of your test. You may be told not to take certain heart or blood pressure medications the morning of the test that could affect your results. If you have any questions about your medications, ask your doctor. Don't stop taking any medication without talking with your doctor first. If you use an inhaler for your breathing, you may need to bring it with you. On the day of the test, wear soft-soled shoes that are good for walking and comfortable clothes. Don't bring any valuables. During an exercise stress test, a technician will first gently clean small areas on your chest and put electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph monitor ( EKG) that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test. Before you start exercising, the technician will do an EKG, measure your heart rate at rest, and take your blood pressure. You'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bicycle and be asked to gradually go faster or work harder. You'll do this until you reach a target heart rate, feel exhausted, or start having symptoms of heart issues. The lab technician will regularly ask how you're feeling. You should tell them if you feel pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, or jaw, are short of breath, dizzy, or lightheaded, or notice anything else unusual. It's normal for your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate to go up or for you to sweat during the test. The lab technician will watch for any symptoms or changes on the EKG monitor that suggest you should stop. After the test, you'll walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. The technician will watch your heart rate, blood pressure, and EKG until they return to normal. The appointment will last about 60 minutes, but the exercise time is usually between 7 and 12 minutes. Besides the exercise stress test, other kinds include: Pharmacologic stress test: This test is used for people who can't exercise. They take a drug such as adenosine, dipyridamole, or dobutamine to make their heart respond as if they were exercising. Stress echocardiogram: An echocardiogram (often called an ""echo"") is a graphic outline of your heart's movement. A stress echo can show the motion of your heart's walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed. It can show a lack of blood flow that other heart tests can't. Nuclear stress test: This helps your doctor know which parts of your heart are healthy and work well and which don't. You'll get a shot of a very small and harmless amount of radioactive substance, then your doctor will use a special camera to see the blood flow to your heart muscle. This will be done first while you're at rest and again after you exercise. You'll prepare differently for these tests, so ask your doctor for specific instructions."
33,"Are you worried about high blood pressure in yourself, a family member, or a friend? Your concern is well-founded. If left untreated, high blood pressure -- also called hypertension -- can lead to a range of health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Knowing more about high blood pressure can help you prevent this condition from damaging your health, or the health of someone you love. You can start by learning what's true about this condition -- and what's not. Here are five common misconceptions about high blood pressure. Early on, you may not notice symptoms of high blood pressure, so you may not be too concerned. However, in the long run high blood pressure can kill you. Normally, your heart beats regularly, pumping blood through the vessels all over your body. As the blood is pushed by the heartbeat, the blood in turn pushes against the sides of your blood vessels. Blood vessels are flexible and can widen or constrict as needed to keep blood flowing well. For a variety of reasons, your blood may begin to push too hard against the blood vessels. This is high blood pressure, which can cause your arteries to become stiff over time. This is how problems begin. High blood pressure can lead to damage of your blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and other organs in your body. Heart disease and stroke, both caused by high blood pressure, are the first and fifth leading causes of death in the U. S. The scary thing about high blood pressure is that you may have it without even knowing it. That's why doctors often call high blood pressure the ""silent killer."" Health care professionals agree: High blood pressure is a big deal. Perhaps you have other relatives with high blood pressure. Maybe you're a member of a group of people who are at greater risk. For these or other reasons, you may be tempted to think that there's nothing you can do about high blood pressure. Here is some good news about high blood pressure: Even if you have many risk factors, there are steps you can take to prevent high blood pressure: Keep your weight at a healthy level. You can accomplish this by a combination of healthy eating and regular exercise. Eat a healthy diet. This includes eating only the amount of food your body needs and choosing foods high in nutrients and low in fat, sugar, and salt. Limit how much salt you eat. Most of the sodium you eat is in the form of salt. It may be salt that you add at the table or salt added to processed foods you consume. Limit how much alcohol you drink. Don't smoke tobacco, and minimize your exposure to secondhand smoke. Get regular exercise. Try to get at least 30 minutes of activity each day, at least five days a week. Exercise relieves stress and helps you control your weight. Don't let stress build up. The chemicals your body makes in response to stress make your heart beat harder and faster and your blood vessels tighten. All this makes blood pressure higher. Ask your doctor for suggestions about high blood pressure and how to prevent it. Your doctor may refer you to other health care professionals who can help. You may notice that when your doctor measures your blood pressure, the reading includes two numbers, one written on top of the other. These numbers can be confusing. The top number is called your systolic blood pressure. This number represents the force of blood through your blood vessels during your heartbeat. 119 or below is normal systolic blood pressure 120-129 is considered elevated 130 and greater is high blood pressure The bottom number is called your diastolic blood pressure. This number represents the force of blood through your blood vessels in between heartbeats, while your heart is resting. 79 or below is normal diastolic blood pressure 80 and greater is hypertension Many people pay more attention to the systolic rate than the diastolic, but experts say that the heart can tolerate a high top (systolic) number better than a high bottom (diastolic) number. As you age, though, the systolic number tends to take on additional significance as the risk of heart attack and especially stroke increases. Blood pressure does change throughout the day, depending on your activities. Blood pressure changes over time, as well. Systolic blood pressure tends to rise as you get older. Diastolic blood pressure may decrease as you get older. If either of your blood pressure readings is consistently above normal, then you need to take action right away. You and your doctor can develop a plan to treat high blood pressure or even prehypertension before damage to your organs occurs. Give up your favorite foods. Take drugs with annoying side effects. These are some things you might fear when you think about high blood pressure treatment. It is true that it may take some time to develop a treatment plan that works best for you, because high blood pressure often has several underlying causes. In many cases, the specific cause of high blood pressure may not be evident. Your doctor will work closely with you to determine which combination of treatments works to best control high blood pressure. Your treatment plan is likely to include the following elements: The DASH eating plan. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH) plan includes eating less fat and saturated fat as well as eating more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole-grain foods. Limiting use of salt and alcohol can also help lower your high blood pressure. A dietitian can help you find ways to meet these goals without giving up your favorite foods or great flavor. Weight Control. Being overweight increases your risk of developing high blood pressure. Following the DASH eating plan and getting regular exercise can help you lose weight. Ask your doctor to help you determine a goal. Your doctor can also refer you to other health care professionals for assistance in setting up a weight loss plan. Decreasing the amount of alcohol you consume. Alcohol may increase your blood pressure, as well, especially if you are drinking too much. Cutting back or abstaining might be essential. No smoking. Tobacco smoke can make blood pressure rise. It can also directly damage your heart and blood vessels. Talk with your doctor about ways to quit. Medication. Your doctor is likely to prescribe medication to control your high blood pressure. It's common to take more than one drug to treat high blood pressure. Your doctor may ask you to switch drugs or change the dosage until you find a combination that works best to control high blood pressure with the fewest side effects for you. Medications used to treat high blood pressure include: Diuretics to reduce the amount of fluid in your blood by helping your body rid itself of extra sodium ACE inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and calcium channel blockers to help keep your blood vessels from tightening Beta-blockers to prevent your body from making the hormone adrenaline; adrenaline is a stress hormone that makes your heart beat harder and faster. It also makes your blood vessels tighten. All of this makes blood pressure higher. The medication slows your heart rate, decreasing your blood pressure. In fact, if you work with your doctor to develop a comprehensive program for managing your high blood pressure, that plan can work. To maximize the benefits of your plan, follow these steps: Check your blood pressure as often as recommended by your doctor. Follow your treatment plan consistently. Let your doctor know right away if you have problems with parts of the plan. Your doctor may refer you to other health care professionals who can help. See your doctor as often as requested. Bring your blood pressure records to show your doctor how the plan is working. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for information about medication side effects. Know when to call your doctor if there is a problem. Reduce how much salt you take in. Learning about high blood pressure and how it can harm your health is the first step in controlling this condition so you can remain healthy for years to come."
34,"You want relief -- now. Although there isn't a cure, there are treatments that can cut down on how long these headaches last and how painful they are. Some even work to prevent a cluster. Your doctor will help you figure out what you need. You may have to take more than one medicine. Take action at the first sign of head pain. Oxygen and prescription drugs that doctors call triptans are the two most common treatments for clusters that have already started. If your doctor prescribes oxygen, you'll breathe through a mask connected to an oxygen tank for 15-20 minutes. It's a safe, effective way to ease this type of pain. Triptans can often shorten your headache and give you pain relief. These drugs include: Almotriptan ( Axert) Eletriptan ( Relpax) Frovatriptan ( Frova) Naratriptan ( Amerge) Rizatriptan ( Maxalt) Sumatriptan ( Alsuma, Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Sumavel Dose Pro, Zembrace Sym Touch) Zolmitriptan ( Zomig) Most triptans are pills. Some come as nasal sprays. You get others as shots. ( Your doctor can show you how to do this at home.) You shouldn't take triptans if you have certain heart or blood vessel problems. If you can't use these treatments, or if they don't work for you, your doctor may suggest: Octreotide . This drug is a lab-made form of somatostatin, a growth hormone. You take it through an IV in your vein. Lidocaine . This is an anesthetic, or a ""numbing"" drug. You spray it up your nose on the painful side of your head. Ergot alkaloids. These meds are tablets that dissolve under your tongue. You need to take them at the first sign of a cluster in order for them to work. There's another form of this drug called DHE that you usually take through an IV. These treatments aim to stop cluster headaches from happening. You take them at the start of a cluster episode. When and how much you take depend on how long yours usually last and how often you get them. Work with your doctor to find the best schedule for you. Medicines for cluster headache prevention include: Verapamil ( Calan, Covera HS, Verelan). Your doctor may call this drug a calcium channel blocker. It's also used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain. Verapamil cuts down on how many headaches you get. It can take a while to start working. So in the meantime, you may also need to take other preventive medicines that work faster, such as steroids. Topiramate ( Topamax). This drug is also used to treat epilepsy. Your doctor may combine it with other preventive meds, such as verapamil or steroids. Corticosteroids (steroids). Doctors also call these meds, which include prednisone, ""glucocorticoids."" They work faster than some other preventive options. These drugs may help if your headaches usually crop up during a period of less than 3 weeks. They come as pills, a shot, or through an IV. Your doctor will probably give them to you for a short while. If you take them for too long, they can cause weight gain, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and other side effects. Lithium ( Lithobid). A few small studies show that this drug can help cut the number of cluster headaches you get. But it's usually less helpful at preventing them if you take it over a long time. Lithium has many side effects and can be dangerous in large doses. So while you take it, you'll need to get regular tests to check the level of it in your blood, track your thyroid levels, and make sure your kidneys and liver work right. CGRP Inhibitors. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy) are specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. You give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device. Researchers are studying other medicines to prevent clusters. These include melatonin, capsaicin, and valproic acid. If you can't take other medicines for prevention, or they don't stop your headaches, your doctor may suggest that you try one of these. If you have chronic cluster headaches and medicine doesn't help, a nerve block may be an option. It's a shot of anesthetic medicine that is sometimes combined with steroids. It stops the pain by blocking or numbing the nerves connected with cluster headaches. You get the injection in the back of your head. There are a couple of devices designed to interupt the lectrical impulses in your brain that triggers cluster headaches. A device called Spring TMS or e Neura s TMS uses a technique called a transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS). Place it on the back of your head for about a minute for release of a pulse of magnetic energy. Similarly, Cefaly uses transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation and is worn as a headband on the forehead and turned on daily for 20 minutes to prevent migraine from developing. There is also a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator called gamma Core. When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."
35,"If you have heart disease, take extra care to avoid catching a cold. It can sometimes lead to complications that can cause some serious problems. If your cold turns into pneumonia, for instance, that makes it tougher for you to take in oxygen. As a result, your heart will need to work harder to pump blood throughout your body. Learn what you can do to protect your health and feel your best. Avoid any medicine that has a decongestant in it, because it can raise your blood pressure. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before you try any over-the counter cold medicine to make sure it doesn't interfere with your other medications. Your best defense is to make sure you and your family wash your hands regularly. Also try to avoid crowds during cold and flu season. Keep your immune system working at its best -- get plenty of sleep, eat a nutritious diet, exercise regularly, and manage your stress. Watch what you breathe in, too: Avoid cigarette smoke and air pollution. While there's no vaccine against the cold, there are immunizations that can help prevent other risky infections, like pneumonia and the flu. The CDC says people with heart disease should get the flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available each year. That way your body has time to build up enough antibody defenses before the flu season kicks into high gear. It can begin as early as October and last as late as May. It's best to get vaccinated before October, but you can still do it until the end of flu season. The shot usually starts to protect you about 2 weeks after you get it. There are two pneumonia vaccines to help protect adults against pneumococcal pneumonia. You will begin to get them once you turn age 65, or earlier if you have certain medical conditions. Talk to your doctor to see if you need a pneumonia vaccine."
36,"Summer is the time for kids to relax, sleep late, and have fun. No kid wants to trade vacation for the structure and routine of the school year. Although kids with ADHD can have a hard time getting used to classrooms and homework again, you can take steps to make the transition easier for both of you. Help your child stay on top of homework. Great tools for organizing include: A calendar or daily planner A dry-erase or bulletin board to post due dates and reminders A desk organizer and storage bins for school supplies to keep his study space neat and free from distractions Color-coded folders or a multi-pocket binder to keep assignments straight Let him help make a shopping list for supplies for the coming year. Ask his school if you can get an extra set of textbooks to keep at home. Write all of the activities your child has planned on one big calendar. Include things like after-school clubs, sports, music lessons, and regular play dates. Add special projects and tests as they come up. Leave room in each day for homework, plus some time to relax and have fun. Let her help design the schedule, so she feels a sense of control and ownership. Go over the schedule each day until she understands the routine. If your child slept late during summer vacation, start waking him up a little earlier each day. That way he won't be groggy when school starts. Make bedtime a little earlier each night, too, so he gets enough sleep. Start him back on any ADHD medicines if you took a break for the summer. Put a list of the daily morning activities on the fridge or somewhere your child will see it. Write down everything she needs to do before walking out the door, including: Get dressed. Make the bed. Eat breakfast. Pack homework. Take backpack, sneakers, jacket, and lunch. Meet with your child's new teacher(s). Talk about classroom changes that helped him learn in the past. For example, kids with ADHD find it easier to focus when they sit in the front of the class, away from distractions like friends and windows. Ask for access to the schedule. You may want to get a second set of books to keep at home, too. Also, discuss varied teaching methods that can keep your child interested. If you already have a 504 Plan or an individualized education program ( IEP) set up, go over it with the new teacher. A 504 plan guarantees that kids with special needs get accommodations in the classroom. What those are depend on the child. An IEP covers more than a 504 plan, but it's also more complex. It might also mean your child won't be in a regular classroom. Find out how much homework the teacher plans to assign each night. You may want to ask for extra help to make sure your child can finish all of his assignments, or for extra time on tests. Figure out how you and the teacher will stay in touch during the school year. Is your child starting middle or high school? Did you move over the summer? A big change like that can be hard for a child or teen with ADHD. Make it easier by reaching out to the school before classes start. Help the new school match your child with the classes and teachers that fit his abilities and learning style. Call the school and arrange to share report cards, test scores, and notes from last year. Meet with the guidance counselor and your child's teachers. You may need to update his 504 Plan or IEP, or make a new one. Ask the guidance counselor to take you and your child on a tour of the new school. Meet with teachers, the principal, the nurse, and anyone else your child will see daily. Walk through the whole school day with your child so he knows where he needs to go and when. If possible, try to arrange a playdate or hangout with another student from your child's new class. Advance planning and practice, along with familiar routines at home, will help you both get used to this change and maybe feel more confident on the first day of school.."
37,"Can what you eat help attention, focus, or hyperactivity? There's no clear scientific evidence that ADHD is caused by diet or nutritional problems. But certain foods may play at least some role in affecting symptoms in a small group of people, research suggests. So are there certain things you shouldn't eat if you have the condition? Or if your child has it, should you change what he eats? Here are answers to questions about elimination diets, supplements, and foods that may ease symptoms of the disorder. It may include the foods you eat and any nutritional supplements you may take. Ideally, your eating habits would help the brain work better and lessen symptoms, such as restlessness or lack of focus. You may hear about these choices that you could focus on: Overall nutrition: The assumption is that some foods you eat may make your symptoms better or worse. You might also not be eating some things that could help make symptoms better. Supplementation diet: With this plan, you add vitamins, minerals, or other nutrients. The idea is that it could help you make up for not getting enough of these through what you eat. Supporters of these diets think that if you don't get enough of certain nutrients, it may add to your symptoms. Elimination diets: These involve not eating foods or ingredients that you think might be triggering certain behaviors or making your symptoms worse. ADHD diets haven't been researched a lot. Data is limited, and results are mixed. Many health experts, though, think that what you eat and drink may help ease symptoms. Experts say that whatever is good for the brain is likely to be good for ADHD. You may want to eat: A high-protein diet. Beans, cheese, eggs, meat, and nuts can be good sources of protein. Eat these kinds of foods in the morning and for after-school snacks. It may improve concentration and possibly make ADHD medications work longer. More complex carbohydrates. These are the good guys. Load up on vegetables and some fruits, including oranges, tangerines, pears, grapefruit, apples, and kiwi. Eat this type of food in the evening, and it may help you sleep. More omega-3 fatty acids. You can find these in tuna, salmon, and other cold-water white fish. Walnuts, Brazil nuts, and olive and canola oils are other foods with these in them. You could also take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement. The FDA approved an omega compound called Vayarin as part of an ADHD management strategy. Simple carbohydrates. Cut down on how many of these you eat: Candy Corn syrup Honey Sugar Products made from white flour White rice Potatoes without the skins. Some experts recommend that people with ADHD take a 100% vitamin and mineral supplement each day. Other nutrition experts, though, think that people who eat a normal, balanced diet don't need vitamin or micronutrient supplements. They say there's no scientific evidence that vitamin or mineral supplements help all children who have the disorder. While a multivitamin may be OK when children, teens, and adults don't eat balanced diets, mega-doses of vitamins can be toxic. Avoid them. ADHD symptoms vary from person to person. Work with your doctor closely if you're considering taking a supplement. To follow one of these, you pick a particular food or ingredient you think might be making your symptoms worse. Then you don't eat anything with that in it. If the symptoms get better or go away, then you keep avoiding that food. If you cut a food from your diet, can it improve your symptoms? Research in all these areas is ongoing and the results are not clear-cut. Most scientists don't recommend this approach for managing ADHD, though. Still, here are some common areas of concern and what the experts suggest: Food additives: In 1975, an allergist first proposed that artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives might lead to hyperactivity in some children. Since then, researchers and child behavior experts have hotly debated this issue. Some say the idea of cutting all those things out of a diet is unfounded and unsupported by science. But one study has shown that some food coloring and one preservative did make some children more hyperactive. But the effects varied according to age and additive. Based on this and other recent studies, the American Academy of Pediatrics now agrees that eliminating preservatives and food colorings from the diet is a reasonable option for children with ADHD. Some experts recommend that people with ADHD avoid these substances: Artificial colors, especially red and yellow Food additives such as aspartame, MSG (monosodium glutamate), and nitrites. Some studies have linked hyperactivity to the preservative sodium benzoate. Sugar: Some children become hyperactive after eating candy or other sugary foods. No evidence suggests that this is a cause of ADHD, though. For the best overall nutrition, sugary foods should be a small part of anyone's diet. But you can try cutting them to see if symptoms improve. Caffeine: Small amounts of it may help with some ADHD symptoms in children, studies have shown. But the side effects of caffeine may outweigh any potential benefit. Most experts recommend that people eat or drink less caffeine or just avoid it. It you take medication for ADHD, caffeine can make some side effects worse."
38,"Most minor cuts and scrapes heal on their own, with little more intervention needed than mild soap and water to keep them clean. But more serious cuts or incisions from surgical procedures may require stitches, or sutures, to hold tissues together while they heal. The goal is to piece together the edges so that skin and other tissues can fuse back together. Then the stitches are removed. Although it's natural to feel a little anxious if you're getting stitches, especially if you've just experienced trauma, the procedure is generally painless. And stitches will help cuts heal with minimal scarring or risk for infection. It's not always easy to tell if a cut requires stitches. Ultimately, it's up to your health care provider to determine if stitches are needed. You should seek medical care for any cut that: Is deep, jagged, or gaping Is on the face or another part of the body where scarring may be an issue Bleeds profusely without stopping after 20 minutes of direct pressure Feels numb Is in a hand or limb that doesn't function properly after being cut If any of these criteria apply to your injury, see a doctor as soon as you can. In the meantime, apply direct pressure to help control bleeding. It might also help to raise the injured area above the level of your heart, if possible. There are certain instances in which stitches may not be advised, such as puncture wounds, though you may still need to see a doctor, especially if you have not had a tetanus shot in more than five years. Once a health care provider has assessed your injury and determined that you need stitches, the first steps he or she will take in treating the wound are to clean and numb the area, though not necessarily in that order. Although cleaning a wound is not very painful in most cases, the doctor may first administer a local anesthetic, similar to what your dentist might use, to maximize your comfort. If your injury seems particularly contaminated, however, cleansing it -- usually with running tap water and a mild soap -- may be a higher priority. Once the area is numb, the doctor will take a closer look to make sure there's no dirt, debris, or other foreign objects inside the cut before sewing it together. An X-ray may also be ordered to help look for remaining debris. If you cut yourself on a piece of glass or sharp metal, for instance, it's crucial to ensure that there are no remaining shards inside the cut. The doctor may remove any dead tissues to help the healing process. He or she will then pull the edges of the cut together and, for each stitch, loop thread through either side of the cut and tie a knot to hold the wound closed. Doctors can use different types of surgical thread made from materials such as silk or nylon, which may be in single filaments or braided. There's even surgical thread that is designed to dissolve over time so that the stitches don't need to be removed. These are used most frequently in deep cuts. The doctor or nurse will give you instructions for caring for your stitches as your cut heals. These may include specific steps for cleaning and dressing the wound. You may be advised to keep the wound and bandages dry. Your doctor may also recommend an antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection and make you aware of signs that may indicate infection. Keep an eye out for such signs, including a fever higher than 100 degrees or red streaks on the skin near the wound. And if any of your stitches pop or break, or you have any other concerns, be sure to contact your doctor. Stitches typically need to remain in place for several days to a couple of weeks, depending on the severity of the cut and location. Your doctor will tell you when to come back to have them taken out. Removing stitches is a much faster process than putting them in. The doctor simply clips each thread near the knot and pulls them out. You may feel a slight tugging sensation, but the removal of stitches shouldn't hurt at all. You won't even need an anesthetic. Although removing stitches is not a difficult process, you shouldn't try to remove them yourself. It's important for your doctor to check to see that the wound is healing properly and to make sure that it's OK for the stitches to come out. The doctor may also have special instructions for you after the stitches are removed, which may help minimize scarring. Stitches aren't the only option doctors have to close cuts and incisions. Cuts sometimes can be held together with butterfly tape or adhesive strips, which you may be able to do yourself at home for more minor cuts. There are even special staples or tissue glue, but those tend to work best with clean, straight incisions, such as in surgical procedures. There are different criteria and care instructions for each type of closure. Your health care provider can help decide which is best for you and tell you how to care for your injury as it heals."
39,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is often called a ""silent disease"" because you usually don't know that you have it. There may be no symptoms or signs. Nonetheless, it damages the body and eventually may cause problems like heart disease. Therefore, it's important to regularly monitor your blood pressure, especially if it has ever been high or above the ""normal"" range, or if you have a family history of hypertension. Blood pressure is most often measured with a device known as a sphygmomanometer, which consists of a stethoscope, arm cuff, dial, pump, and valve. You can get your blood pressure measured by a health care provider, at a pharmacy, or you can purchase a blood pressure monitor for your home. Home blood pressure readings can be especially helpful in diagnosing and monitoring hypertension because they represent what is happening in the real world (rather than just at the doctor's office). But before these numbers can be relied on for treatment decisions, it is important to bring the monitor in to your doctor's office and have it checked against the office readings for accuracy. Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic blood pressure is the maximum pressure during a heartbeat, when the heart is sending blood throughout the body. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure between heartbeats, when the heart is filling with blood. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is written systolic over diastolic (for example, 120/80 mm Hg, or ""120 over 80""). According to the most recent guidelines, a normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure is 120 to 129 and less than 80. Hypertension is blood pressure that is greater than 130/80. Blood pressure may increase or decrease, depending on your age, heart condition, emotions, activity, and the medications you take. One high reading does not mean you have high blood pressure. It is necessary to measure your blood pressure at different times, while you are resting comfortably for at least five minutes. To make the diagnosis of hypertension, at least three readings that are elevated are usually required. In addition to measuring your blood pressure, your doctor will ask about your medical history (whether you've had heart problems before), assess your risk factors (whether you smoke, have high cholesterol, diabetes, etc. ), and talk about your family history (whether any members of your family have had high blood pressure or heart disease). Your doctor will also conduct a physical exam. As part of this exam, he or she may use a stethoscope to listen to your heart for any abnormal sounds or âmurmursâ that could indicate a problem with the valves of the heart. Your doctor will also listen for a whooshing or swishing sound that could indicate your arteries are blocked. Your doctor may also check the pulses in your arm and ankle to determine if they are weak or even absent. If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Electrocardiogram ( EKG or ECG): A test that measures the electrical activity, rate, and rhythm of your heartbeat via electrodes attached to your arms, legs, and chest. The results are recorded on graph paper. Echocardiogram: This is a test that uses ultrasound waves to provide pictures of the heart's valves and chambers so the pumping action of the heart can be studied and measurement of the chambers and wall thickness of the heart can be made."
40,"By its very nature, urge incontinence, sometimes referred to as overactive bladder ( OAB), can make you feel out of control. You may not be able to make it to the bathroom without peeing when you get an intense urge to go. And you may get this urge just from hearing water running. The result can be discomfort, embarrassment, and anxiety. Urge incontinence occurs when an overactive bladder spasms or contracts at the wrong times. You may leak urine when you sleep or feel the need to pee after drinking a little water, even though you know your bladder isn't full. This sensation can be a result of nerve damage or abnormal signals from the nerves to the brain. Medical conditions and certain medications -- such as diuretics - can aggravate it. Whatever the source, you don't have to feel that your OAB symptoms are beyond your control or that they are controlling your life. In fact, you may be able to take control over them just by making some changes in your everyday behavior. Try these practical tips to get started. Eliminating caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol can greatly reduce the symptoms of urge incontinence, because all three irritate the bladder. Caffeine also acts as a diuretic, meaning it causes you to urinate more. Cutting out the big three can be tough. Try these strategies: If you need help to quit smoking, ask your doctor about smoking-cessation groups or programs. Since caffeine is in coffee, teas, colas, energy drinks, and chocolate, you may find it hard to go cold turkey. Try cutting out caffeine slowly. Wean yourself over the course of a week or two until you're completely caffeine-free. If you don't want to cut out alcohol completely, limit yourself to one beverage a day. Controlling your intake of liquids can be tricky. You might think that cutting back on liquids across the board would reduce OAB. In fact, it can make urine more concentrated, which can irritate the bladder. On the other hand, it's a good idea not to pressure the bladder by drinking too much liquid at once. Try these strategies: Drink plain water when you're thirsty, from four to eight 8-ounce glasses a day. You'll know you're drinking enough if your urine is light yellow or almost colorless. Sip water throughout the day, instead of gulping down a lot at one time. Unless you're exercising, don't carry a large water bottle. It may tempt you to drink too much at once. If you're waking up to urinate more than twice a night, drink most of your liquids during the waking hours. Limit how much you drink two to three hours before bedtime. If you take a diuretic, try taking it in the morning. That way, you should be able to empty your bladder by bedtime. It's possible to retrain your bladder to hold more urine for longer periods of time. Better muscle control can also help. Ask your doctor for a specific plan and stick with it; it can take up to three months to see results. These strategies may be part of your plan: Keep a bladder control log. Record how much you drink, when you pee, and how much (average for you, less than average, or more than average). Each time you have an urge to pee, record how strong it is, on a scale of 1 to 10, and whether any urine leaks. Do Kegel exercises. Kegels strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that hold up the bladder. They also help reconnect nerve impulse communication between the bladder and the brain. To do them, lie on your bed or the floor and squeeze the pelvic muscles as if you were trying to pick up a marble with your vagina. Then pretend you're trying to suck the marble inside the vagina. Hold for a count of 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds, repeating the pattern 10 times, three times a day. The NIH recommends holding for 10 seconds, relaxing for 10 seconds and repeat 10 times, 3 times per day. (there is no exact formula, but this may give one more specific instructions) Resist the urge to urinate for five minutes. Whenever the urge to pee strikes, try to hold it for longer than you normally would. Build up longer intervals over a 12-week period. The goal is to urinate every three to four hours. Break the mind/ bladder association. If you have certain habits -- say, racing to the bathroom as soon as you get to work or walk in the door at home -- try changing your routine. The urge to pee may diminish in 30 to 60 seconds. Tension, diet, and being overweight can all contribute to urinary incontinence. The good news is that you can do something about all three: Eat more vegetables and fiber. Fiber helps you avoid constipation, which may help reduce pressure on your bladder. Reduce tension. Tense situations can make you to feel as if you need to pee. Deep breathing exercises are one of the tools that can ease tension. Exercise. If you're overweight, losing weight will keep extra pounds from adding to the pressure on your bladder. Exercise may aggravate stress incontinence, though. Use good posture when you urinate. Sit back on the toilet. Don't lean forward, since this may put unwanted stress on the urethra and bladder. In addition to cutting down or eliminating alcohol and caffeine drinks, limiting other foods or beverages may help OAB. Try cutting back on: Acidic foods and beverages, such as tomatoes, pineapple, and citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes Salty foods, which can make you thirstier and hence, lead to drinking more liquids Spicy foods, such as chilies, which can irritate the bladder Carbonated beverages, such as sodas or seltzers Though urge incontinence is uncomfortable, it's also very treatable. Changes in your lifestyle and habits can play a part in treating it."
41,"An elbow dislocation occurs when the bones of the forearm (the radius and ulna) move out of place compared with the bone of the upper arm (the humerus). The elbow joint, formed where these 3 bones meet, becomes dislocated, or out of joint. Specific, serious injuries that may occur are fractures (breaking of the bones in the arm), injuries to the arteries in the arm (the vessels carrying blood to the hand), and injuries to the nerves that run through the elbow area, impairing movement and feeling in the arm and hand. The cause of most elbow dislocations is usually a fall, most commonly with the arm all the way out. However, any traumatic injury (such as a car crash) can result in an elbow dislocation. Severe pain in the elbow, swelling, and inability to bend your arm are all signs of an elbow dislocation. In some cases, you may lose feeling in your hand or no longer have a pulse (can't feel your heartbeat in your wrist). Arteries and nerves run by your elbow, so it is possible you might have injured them during the dislocation. You should go to the doctor's office or hospital's emergency department immediately if you are unable to move your elbow, have severe pain, cannot feel your hand, or have no pulse in your wrist. The doctor will begin with an examination. The doctor will make sure your nerves and arteries are unhurt by checking your pulse, making sure you can feel normally, move your fingers and wrist, and make sure that blood is flowing normally to your hand. Next, the doctor will get X-rays. Sometimes, breaks in the bone can look like dislocations, and some breaks happen when dislocations occur. If the doctor suspects an injury to your artery, further tests, such as an arteriogram (an X-ray of your artery) may be performed. An elbow dislocation is a serious injury that needs medical care. At home, put ice on the elbow. This will help with the pain and will reduce some of the swelling. But the most important thing to do is to see a doctor. It is best that this injury undergo evaluation by a doctor, but, at home, you can also check for a few signs that will show if the artery in the arm and the nerves are intact. To check for the artery, feel below your thumb at the base of your wrist. You should be able to feel your pulse. Press on the tips of your fingers. They should blanch (turn white) and then return to a normal pink color within 3 seconds. If either of these tests is abnormal, seek medical care immediately. Three nerves run by the elbow. Each nerve has portions that help with strength and feeling. First check for strength by bending your wrist up as if you were saying "" Stop"" (radial nerve function), then spread your fingers apart (ulnar nerve function), then try to touch your thumb to your little finger (median nerve function). If you have trouble with any of these tests, go to the doctor immediately. Check for feeling by touching all over your hand and arm. If any feeling of numbness results, see a doctor immediately. The doctor will reduce (put back in place) your elbow by pulling down on your wrist and levering your elbow back into place. This is very painful, so powerful medications for pain may be given before reduction. After your elbow is back in place, the doctor will get X-rays and then put you in a splint that will keep your elbow bent. The splint will make an "" L"" around the back of your elbow. It will be made of plaster or fiberglass. Its purpose is to prevent movement of your arm at the elbow. Usually, your arm will be placed in a sling to help you hold up your splint. After you are sent home from the doctor's office, you will be instructed to follow up with a bone doctor (orthopedist). Wear your splint. Do not move your elbow. Elevate your elbow as much as possible, and ice it to reduce swelling. Do not fall on your outstretched arm. Avoid situations that would make falls more common (such as walking at night or being around slippery floors). Generally, this injury heals well. After watching closely for 3-5 days, the bone doctor will have you begin gentle movement exercises of your elbow. Usually, recovery occurs without any lasting effects. elbow dislocation, elbow joint"
42,"Kidney stones are hard deposits made from minerals such as calcium or waste products such as uric acid. They start small, but they can grow bigger as more minerals stick to them. Some kidney stones often pass on their own without treatment. Other stones that are painful or that get stuck in your urinary tract sometimes need to be removed with surgery. You might have a procedure or surgery to take out kidney stones if: The stone is very large and can't pass on its own. You're in a lot of pain. The stone is blocking the flow of urine out of your kidney. You have had many urinary tract infections because of the stone. These four treatments can be used on your kidney stones: Shock wave lithotripsy Ureteroscopy Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy Open surgery Here's more about each of these: SWL is the most common kidney stone treatment. It works best for small or medium stones. It's noninvasive, which means no cuts are made in your skin. During this procedure, you lie on a table. You'll get medicine beforehand to limit any pain or discomfort. The doctor uses an X-ray or ultrasound to find the stone (or stones) in your kidney. Then, she aims high-energy shock waves at your kidney from the outside. These waves go through your skin and break up the stone into small pieces. The doctor might put a tube called a stent into your ureter (urine flows through this from your kidneys to your bladder). This stent helps the pieces of stone pass. SWL takes about an hour. You'll usually go home on the same day. Afterward, you'll drink lots of water to flush the stone pieces out in your urine. You might have to pee through a strainer to catch pieces of the stone so she can test them. SWL removes kidney stones in about half of people who have it. If it doesn't work, you might need to have the procedure repeated. The procedure can cause side effects such as cramps or blood in your urine. More serious problems are less likely, but can include: Bleeding around the kidney Infection Damage to the kidney Stone that blocks the flow of urine This procedure treats stones in the kidneys and ureters. Your doctor uses a thin, flexible scope to find and remove stones. No cuts are made in your skin. You'll sleep through this procedure. Your doctor will pass the scope through your bladder and ureter into your kidney. She uses a small basket to remove small stones. If the stones are larger, the doctor will pass a laser through the scope to break them up. You usually are able to go home on the same day. The doctor might place a stent in your ureter to help urine drain from your kidney into your bladder. You'll go back to the doctor after 4 to 10 days to have the stent taken out. Some stents have a string on the end so you can pull it out yourself. Be sure to carefully follow your doctor's instructions about taking out a stent yourself. Possible problems after a ureteroscopy include: Infection Narrowing of the ureter Bleeding If your stone is large or lithotripsy doesn't break it up enough, this surgery is an option. PCNL uses a small tube to reach the stone and break it up with high-frequency sound waves. You will be given something so that you won't be awake during this surgery. Your surgeon will make a small cut in your back or side and place a thin scope into the hole. The surgery can be done in one of two ways: Nephrolithotomy: Your surgeon removes the stone through a tube Nephrolithotripsy: Your surgeon uses sound waves or a laser to break up the stone and then vacuums up the pieces with a suction machine. The surgery takes 20 to 45 minutes. You'll typically have to stay in the hospital for a day or two afterward. Usually, a stent will have to stay in your kidney for a few days to help urine drain. Your doctor might do an X-ray or ultrasound a few weeks later to see whether any parts of the stone are left. She might also send the stone fragments to a lab to find out what they're made of. Risks from this surgery include: Infection Bleeding Damage to the bladder, bowel, ureter, kidney, or liver Open surgery is rarely done for kidney stones anymore. But if your stone is very large or it can't be removed or crushed with other treatments, surgery might be an option. Surgery may also help if: One of the stones is stuck in your ureter. You're in a lot of pain. The stone is blocking your urine flow. You're bleeding or you have an infection. You will be given something to make you unconscious during the procedure. The surgeon will make a cut in your side and into your kidney. She will remove the stone through the opening. A stent is placed in the ureter to help urine drain. You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. It can take 4 to 6 weeks to fully heal after open surgery. Make sure you understand the risks and benefits of each of your treatment options. Ask your doctor these questions: What side effects can this surgery cause? What are the odds that it will treat my kidney stone? How long will I need to stay in the hospital afterward? What will you give me to control pain after surgery? Is there a chance I'll have to repeat the surgery?"
43,"If you're an adult with ADHD, medications can help a lot. They can give you back your focus and a feeling of control. But for many people, these perks come with a price -- side effects. Most of the time, they're mild and fade after a few weeks or months of treatment. But that's not true for everyone. Here's a look at possible side effects and tips to relieve them. Most people treat their ADHD with stimulant medicines, but some take non-stimulants. Both types have similar side effects: Dizziness Dry Mouth Headaches Loss of Appetite Moodiness Tics Trouble sleeping There are simple things you can do to make taking these medications less of a problem. Dizziness . Sometimes, dizzy spells can be a sign that you're taking too much medication. Check with your doctor. He might also want to check your blood pressure. Dry mouth . Drink plenty of fluids, and use lozenges to keep your mouth moist. Headaches . You might get them after you take your medication on an empty stomach, or if you're dehydrated. Sometimes they come on as the medicine wears off. Your doctor may be able to help by tweaking when you take your drug. Loss of appetite. Some drugs can make you not want to eat much. But don't skip meals. That can lead to low blood sugar, and that may make it harder to focus. Instead, eat several small meals a day, rather than three bigger ones. Eat dinner later in the evening, after the effects of your medication have worn off. You may feel hungry then. Sometimes the worse appetite leads to weight loss. It's usually just a small amount, but tell your doctor if you think you're losing too much weight. Moodiness. Some people find that their medications make them tense and cranky. Like most ADHD drug side effects, this may fade in time. If your moodiness is bothering you, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or changing your medication. Nausea . Take your medicine with food to lower your odds of feeling queasy. If you're supposed to take it in the morning and you're not a breakfast person, you may want to find something you can eat anyway. Tics are repeated movements or sounds that you make without meaning to. ADHD medications don't cause tics, but they can sometimes bring out underlying ones -- maybe tics you had in childhood will come back. Usually these fade over time, but talk to your doctor if they don't go away. Trouble sleeping . Some ADHD medications can rev you up and make it hard to fall asleep. Take your medication earlier in the day, so it wears off well before bedtime. If you're on a long-acting stimulant, you could ask your doctor about trying a short-acting one, where the effects will fade more quickly. Limit or avoid caffeine, too. Turn off your TV, computers, and phones an hour or so before going to bed, and take time to relax. There's no way to know how well a medicine will work for you. Some people do better on one drug than another. It can take a few tries to find the right one. If you have high blood pressure, heart problems, or a history of mental health issues or addiction, your doctor needs to know. These conditions may cause problems with your treatment. Doctors sometimes treat adults with drugs that aren't FDA-approved for ADHD. This is called âoff labelâ use. Because these drugs have different side effects -- and benefits and risks -- you should go over the specifics with your doctor. Many people feel the side effects of their ADHD medications are worth dealing with to get the benefits of the drugs. But if they're severe or interfering with your life, don't try to ignore them. Get help from your doctor. Together, you'll be able to come up with a plan that works best for you."
44,"Trigger finger is a painful condition that makes your fingers or thumb catch or lock when you bend them. It can affect any finger, or more than one. You might hear it called stenosing tenosynovitis. When it affects your thumb, it's called trigger thumb.. Most of the time, it comes from a repeated movement or forceful use of your finger or thumb. It can also happen when tendons -- tough bands of tissue that connect muscles and bones in your finger or thumb -- get inflamed. Together, they and the muscles in your hands and arms bend and straighten your fingers and thumbs. A tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) thanks to the synovium, a membrane that surrounds joints and keeps them lubricated. Sometimes a tendon gets inflamed and swollen. Long-term irritation of the tendon sheath can lead to scarring and thickening that affect the tendon's motion. When this happens, bending your finger or thumb pulls the inflamed tendon through a narrowed sheath and makes it snap or pop. You might notice: A painful clicking or snapping when you bend or straighten your finger. It's worse when your finger's been still, and it gets better as you move it. Stiffness in your finger, especially in the morning Soreness or a bump at the base of the finger or thumb. Your doctor will call this a nodule. A popping or clicking as you move your finger A locked finger that you can't straighten Symptoms often start out mild and become more severe over time. It's more likely to affect you after a period of heavy hand use than an injury. It's often worse: In the morning When you grasp something firmly When you try to straighten your finger Things that make you more likely to get trigger finger include: Age: It usually shows up between ages 40 and 60. Sex: It's more common in women than men. Health conditions: Diabetes, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause trigger finger. Job: It's common among farmers, industrial workers, musicians, and anyone else who repeats finger and thumb movements. Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome: It's most common in the first 6 months after your operation. Your doctor will start with a physical exam of your hand and fingers. The finger may be swollen, stiff, and painful. You might have a bump over the joint in the palm of your hand. Or it could be locked in a bent position. There are no X-rays or lab tests to diagnose trigger finger. It depends on how severe your symptoms are. Most of the time, you'll start with: Rest: Try not to move the finger or thumb. You may need to take time away from the activity that's causing the problem. If you can't quit, you might try padded gloves. Splint: The doctor can give you one designed to keep your finger still. NSAIDs: Your doctor may suggest over-the-counter drugs that fight inflammation, like ibuprofen or naproxen. Steroid injections: She might give you a steroid shot into the tendon sheath. It can keep your symptoms at bay for a year or more, but it might take two shots to get results. If you have severe symptoms or if other treatments don't work, your doctor may suggest a procedure. There are two types: Percutaneous release: The doctor will numb the palm of your hand then insert a needle into the area around the affected tendon. They'll move the needle and your finger to loosen the tendon and make it work smoothly. This will probably happen in the doctor's office. They might use ultrasound to see where the tip of the needle is. This will help make sure they don't damage your tendon or nearby nerves. Tenolysis or trigger finger release surgery: The doctor will make a small cut at the base of the finger and open the sheath around the tendon. This will probably take place in an operating room. The time it takes to get better depends on how bad your condition is. The choice of treatment also affects recovery. For example, you may need to wear a splint for 6 weeks. But most patients with trigger finger recover within a few weeks by resting the finger and using anti-inflammatory drugs. You should be able to move your finger just after surgery. Raising your hand above your heart can ease swelling and pain. Full recovery may take a few weeks, but swelling and stiffness may linger for 6 months. If your finger was super stiff before surgery, the doctor will probably suggest physical therapy to teach you exercises to help loosen it."
45,"Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't use glucose from your blood for energy. To make up for it, your pancreas makes more insulin. Over time, your blood sugar levels go up. Insulin resistance syndrome includes a group of problems like obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. It could affect as many as 1 in 3 Americans. You might also hear it called metabolic syndrome. You can't tell that you have insulin resistance by how you feel. You'll need to get a blood test that checks your blood sugar levels. Likewise, you won't know if you have most of the other conditions that are part of insulin resistance syndrome (high blood pressure, low ""good"" cholesterol levels, and high triglycerides) without seeing your doctor. Some signs of insulin resistance include: A waistline over 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women Blood pressure readings of 130/80 or higher A fasting glucose level over 100 mg/d L A fasting triglyceride level over 150 mg/d L A HDL cholesterol level over under 40 mg/d L in men and 50 mg/d L in women Skin tags Patches of dark, velvety skin called acanthosis nigricans Things that can make this condition more likely include: Obesity, especially belly fat Inactive lifestyle Diet high in carbohydrates Gestational diabetes Health conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and polycystic ovary syndrome A family history of diabetes Smoking Ethnicity -- it's more likely if your ancestry is African, Latino, or Native American Age -- it's more likely after 45 Hormonal disorders like Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly Medications like steroids, antipsychotics, and HIV medications Sleep problems like sleep apnea Your doctor will use these things to diagnose insulin resistance: Questions. She'll want to know about your family's medical history. Physical exam. She'll weigh you and check your blood pressure. Blood tests. You might get: Fasting plasma glucose test. This test measures your blood sugar after you haven't eaten for at least 8 hours. Oral glucose tolerance test. First, you'll take the fasting glucose test. Then you'll drink a sugary solution. Two hours after that, you'll take another blood test. Hemoglobin A1c test . This blood test shows your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months. Doctors use it to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. If you have diabetes, it helps show whether it's under control. You may need to take the test again to confirm the results. When you have insulin resistance, your pancreas makes extra insulin to make up for it. For a while, this will work and your blood sugar levels will stay normal. Over time, though, your pancreas won't be able to keep up. If you don't make changes in the way you eat and exercise, your blood sugar levels will rise until you have prediabetes. Your doctor will look for these blood test results: Fasting plasma glucose test: 100-125 Oral glucose tolerance test: 140-199 after the second test A1c results of 5.7% to 6.4% If you aren't able to manage prediabetes, you'll be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when your test levels reach: Fasting plasma glucose test: 126 or higher Oral glucose tolerance test: 200 or higher after the second test A1c results of 6.5% or above You can take steps to reverse insulin resistance and prevent type 2 diabetes: Exercise. Go for at least 30 minutes a day of moderate activity (like brisk walking) 5 or more days a week. If you're not active now, work up to that. Get to a healthy weight . If you're not sure what you should weigh or how to reach a weight loss goal, ask your doctor. You may also want to talk with a nutritionist and a certified personal trainer. Eat a healthy diet. Think fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, fish, legumes, and other lean protein. Take medications. Your doctor may prescribe a medication called metformin ( Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet) to help keep your blood sugar in check. If metabolic syndrome goes untreated, it could lead to: Severe high blood sugar Severe low blood sugar Heart attack Stroke Kidney disease Eye problems Cancer Alzheimer's disease"
46,"Heavy metals, like arsenic, lead, mercury, and others, are all around us. They're in the ground we walk on, in the water we drink, and in the products we use every day. But high levels of most heavy metals can make you sick. True heavy metal poisoning is rare in the United States. And experts say you should be careful about unproven heavy metal tests or âdetoxâ treatments you find online. They may waste your money, and some could be dangerous. Scientists group these elements based on their higher density, or atomic weights. Many heavy metals exist, including: Arsenic Cadmium Copper Iron Lead Mercury Zinc Not all of these metals are bad for you. We need small amounts of some of them, such as copper and iron, to keep our bodies healthy. This can happen if you eat or drink something tainted with heavy metals or if you breathe in contaminated dust or fumes. You might get heavy metal poisoning if you: Work in a factory that uses heavy metals Breathe in old lead paint dust when you fix up your home Eat fish caught in an area with high levels of mercury Use herbal medicines that have heavy metals in them The signs can vary depending on the metal and the amount. Acute poisoning. This happens if you get a high dose at one time, like in a chemical accident in a factory or after a child swallows a toy made with lead. Symptoms usually come on quickly and you may: Feel confused Go numb Feel sick and throw up Pass out Acute poisoning is an emergency. Call your doctor or local poison control center right away. The national Poison Help Line is 800-222-1222. Chronic poisoning. You get this after contact with a low dose over a long time. As the metal builds up in your body, you can get sick. Symptoms come on slowly and can include: Headache Weakness and tiredness Achy joints and muscles Constipation Different tests can check for different types of heavy metals. Some might test your blood or pee. Others might require an X-ray. Your doctor will also ask you about your job, hobbies, diet, and anything else that could have put you in contact with dangerous substances. Tests for heavy metals aren't routine. Your doctor would test you only if you show symptoms and there is a history of exposure or a good reason to suspect they are related to heavy metals. The main step is to stay away from whatever made you sick so you don't make the problem worse. Your doctor can help you figure out how to protect yourself. Sometimes you might need to have your stomach pumped to get the metals out. If your poisoning is serious, one treatment option is chelation. You get drugs, usually through an IV needle, that go into your blood and âstickâ to the heavy metals in your body. They then get flushed out with your pee. Chelation can be an important part of treatment. But the therapy can be dangerous, and it doesn't work with all heavy metals. So doctors only use it only if you have high levels of the metal and clear symptoms of poisoning. Experts say that heavy metal poisoning is rare. But lots of websites claim it's common and blame it, without proof, for all sorts of health problems. Many businesses sell unreliable tests and expensive or even dangerous treatments. Hair analysis or chelation challenge tests (âprovoked urineâ tests). They're inaccurate. They can't tell you if you're sick or need treatment. Over-the-counter chelation treatments. These are not approved by the FDA, may not be safe, and there's no evidence that they work. If you think you have heavy metal poisoning, don't try to diagnose it or treat it on your own. See your doctor instead. If you're worried about heavy metal poisoning, your doctor can give you personalized advice. General tips include: If you work with heavy metals, always wear masks or other safety equipment. Check local fish advisories to make sure the fish you eat is safe. If you live in a home built before 1978, hire an expert to test it for lead paint. Check labels on products for heavy metals."
47,"Lupus is a difficult disease to diagnose, because its symptoms can be vague. And unlike some other diseases, it cannot be diagnosed with a single lab test. However, when certain clinical criteria are met, lab tests can help confirm a diagnosis of lupus. Blood work and other tests can also help monitor the disease and show the effects of treatment. Web MD takes a look at the uses and limitations of the tests that are commonly used to diagnose and monitor lupus. Antinuclear Antibody ( ANA) What it is: ANA is a type of antibody directed against the cells' nuclei. Why the test is used: ANA is present in nearly everybody with active lupus. Doctors often use the ANA test as a screening tool. Plus, looking at patterns of the antibodies can sometimes help doctors determine the specific disease a person has. That, in turn, helps determine which treatment would be most appropriate. Limitations of the test: Although almost all people with lupus have the antibody, a positive result doesn't necessarily indicate lupus. Positive results are often seen with some other diseases and in a smaller percentage of people without lupus or other autoimmune disorders. So a positive ANA by itself is not enough for a lupus diagnosis. Doctors must consider the result of this test along with other criteria. Antiphospholipid Antibodies ( APLs) What it is: APLs are a type of antibody directed against phospholipids. Why the test is used: APLs are present in up to 60% of people with lupus. Their presence can help confirm a diagnosis. A positive test is also used to help identify women with lupus that have certain risks that require preventive treatment and monitoring. Those risks include blood clots, miscarriage, or preterm birth. Limitations of the test: APLs may also occur in people without lupus. Their presence alone is not enough for a lupus diagnosis. Anti- Sm What it is: Anti- Sm is an antibody directed against Sm, a specific protein found in the cell nucleus. Why the test is used: The protein is found in up to 30% of people with lupus. It's rarely found in people without lupus. So a positive test can help confirm a lupus diagnosis. Limitations of the test: Up to only 30% of people with lupus have a positive anti- Sm test. So relying on an anti- Sm result alone would miss a large majority of people with lupus. Anti-ds DNA What it is: Anti-ds DNA is a protein directed against double-stranded DNA. DNA is the material that makes up the body's genetic code. Why the test is used: Between 75% and 90% of people with lupus have a positive anti-ds DNA test. Also, the test is very specific for lupus. Therefore, a positive test can be useful in confirming a diagnosis. For many people, the titer, or level, of the antibodies rises as the disease becomes more active. So, doctors can also use it to help measure disease activity. Also, the presence of anti-ds DNA indicates a greater risk of lupus nephritis, a kidney inflammation that occurs with lupus. So a positive test can alert doctors to the need to monitor the kidneys. Limitations of the test: Up to 25% of people with lupus have a negative test. So, a negative test doesn't mean a person doesn't have lupus. Anti- Ro( SSA) and Anti- La( SSB) What it is: Anti- Ro( SSA) and Anti- La( SSB) are two antibodies that are commonly found together. They are specific against ribonucleic acid ( RNA) proteins. Why the test is used: Anti- Ro is found in anywhere from 24% to 60% of lupus patients. It's also found in 70% of people with another autoimmune disorder called SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. Anti- La is found in 35% of people with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. For this reason, their presence may be useful in diagnosing one of these disorders. Both antibodies are associated with neonatal lupus, a rare but potentially serious problem in newborns. In pregnant women, a positive Anti- Ro( SSA) or Anti- La( SSB) warns doctors of the need to monitor the unborn baby. Limitations of the test: Like other antibodies, the fact that the test is not positive in many people with lupus means it can't be used to diagnose lupus. Also, it is more indicative of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome than of lupus. C- Reactive Protein ( CRP) What it is: CRP is a protein in the body that can be a marker of inflammation. Why the test is used: The test looks for inflammation, which could indicate active lupus. In some cases, the test could be used to monitor inflammation. Results of the test could indicate changes in disease activity or in response to treatment. Limitations of the test: Because there are many causes for an elevated result, including infection, the test is not diagnostic for lupus. Nor can it distinguish a lupus flare from an infection. Also, the level of CRP doesn't directly correlate with lupus disease activity. So it isn't necessarily useful for monitoring disease activity. Complement What it is: Complement proteins are involved in inflammation. The test can look for levels of specific complement proteins or for total complement. Why the test is used: Complement levels are often low in patients with active disease, especially kidney disease. So doctors may use the test to gauge or monitor disease activity. Limitations of the test: Like other tests, complement must be taken in the context of clinical findings and other test results. A low complement in itself is not diagnostic of lupus. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR) What it is: ESR measures the speed of red blood cells moving toward the bottom of a test tube. When inflammation is present, blood proteins stick together and fall and collect more quickly as sediment. The more quickly the blood cells fall, the greater the inflammation. Why the test is used: ESR is used as a marker of inflammation. Inflammation could indicate lupus activity. This test could be used to monitor inflammation, which could indicate changes in disease activity or response to treatment. Limitations of the test: Like CRP, the ESR is not specific to lupus. Because there are many causes for a positive result, including infection, the test is not diagnostic for lupus. Nor can it distinguish a lupus flare from an infection. Also, the level doesn't directly correlate with lupus disease activity. So it isn't necessarily useful for monitoring disease activity. Complete Blood Cell Count ( CBC) What it is: CBC is a test to measure levels of different blood cells. Why the test is used: Abnormalities in blood cell counts, including white blood cells and red blood cells, may occur in people with lupus. This may be related to the lupus, lupus treatments, or infection. For example, leukopenia, a decrease in the number of white blood cells, is found in about 50% of people with lupus. Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, occurs in about 50% of people with lupus, as well. Doctors can use this test to monitor these potentially serious problems. Limitations of the test: Many other medical conditions can cause abnormalities in blood cell counts. So the test by itself is not specific to a lupus diagnosis. Chemistry Panel What it is: A chemistry panel is a test to assess kidney function and liver function. It also gives information on electrolytes, blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Why the test is used: Abnormalities may indicate the development of complications from lupus. They could also result from treatments for such conditions as kidney disease, elevated blood sugar levels, elevated cholesterol levels, and liver disease. Glomerular Filtration Rate What it is: A glomerular filtration rate measures how effective the kidneys are at filtering the blood to eliminate waste products. It can be found in a blood work report. The GFR is a calculation that includes creatinine level, age, gender, race, and weight. It shows the stage of a person's kidney disease. Besides blood tests used to diagnose and monitor lupus, doctors use urine tests to diagnose and monitor the effects of lupus on the kidneys. These tests include the following: Urine Protein/ Microalbuminuria. These tests measure the amount of protein (or albumin) in urine. Even a small amount may indicate a risk for kidney disease. Creatinine Clearance: This test measures how effective the kidneys are at filtering the blood to eliminate waste products. It is conducted on urine collected over a 24-hour period. Urinalysis: Urinalysis can be used in screening for kidney disease. The presence of protein, red blood cells, white blood cells, and cellular casts may all indicate kidney disease."
48,"Children's blood sugar levels -- especially when they're little -- can be all over the place. No one expects that they'll be perfect all the time. Your goal is simple: Get it into the target range when it isn't, because your child's body can't. Test his blood sugar several times a day so you'll know what you need to do to adjust it. What causes the ups and downs? Food Exercise Growth Illness Stress and other emotions Medication Remember, the numbers on the meter aren't ""good"" or ""bad"" -- they're just numbers. And they give you information about how to keep your child healthy and happy throughout the day and night. Testing is the best way to avoid dangerously high and low levels. You might not notice symptoms, and your child may not be able to explain what's happening. If he can't talk yet, he certainly can't tell you he feels funny. As your child gets older, his targets will change. Your doctor will help you figure out what levels are right for your child."
49,"If you were recently diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, consider asking your doctor these questions at your next visit. What are my treatment options for anxiety? Are there any underlying medical problems that could be causing my anxiety symptoms? Will I need to take an anxiety drug? Will I take it every day or as needed? How long will I need to take it? What side effects can I expect from medications? Is there a way to minimize or prevent side effects? What should I do if I miss a dose of medication? Should I begin therapy sessions? Which type and for how long? How long before I can expect to feel better? Once treated, how likely is it that my anxiety symptoms will return? What lifestyle changes can I make to help me feel better? How will alcohol or other drugs interact with my medication or affect my anxiety?"
50,"Have you noticed swelling in your arms or legs after breast cancer surgery? If so, tell your doctor. She might want to check you for lymphedema. It's common for women to get this condition after their breast cancer treatment. The buildup of lymph, a fluid your body makes, happens when lymph vessels or nodes that the fluid travels through are missing, damaged, or removed. There are two types of lymphedema: primary and secondary. Primary is rare. It happens when certain lymph vessels are missing or faulty at birth. Secondary lymphedema happens when a blockage or another problem changes the flow of lymph fluid through your body's network of lymph vessels and nodes. It can develop not only after breast cancer surgery, but can also come from an infection, scar tissue formation, trauma, deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a vein), radiation, or other cancer treatments. People who've had any of these procedures may be at risk: Simple mastectomy in combination with axillary (arm pit) lymph node removal Lumpectomy in combination with axillary lymph node removal Modified radical mastectomy in combination with axillary lymph node removal Combined cancer surgery and radiation therapy to a lymph node region (such as the neck, armpit, groin, pelvis, or abdomen) Radiation therapy to a lymph node region You can get lymphedema within a few days of surgery, but it can also happen months or years afterward. If untreated, it can become worse. A small amount of swelling, even in your arm, is normal for the first 4 to 6 weeks after breast cancer surgery. Some women may also have redness or pain in the arm, which may be a symptom of inflammation or an infection. But if you think you have any of the symptoms below, call your doctor right away. Prompt treatment can help get lymphedema under control. Swelling in the arms, hands, fingers, shoulders, chest, or legs. A ""full"" or heavy sensation in the arms or legs Skin tightness Less flexibility in your hand, wrist, or ankle Trouble fitting into clothing in one specific area A tight-fitting bracelet, watch, or ring that wasn't tight before Your doctor will look into your medical history (including past surgeries and treatments) and your current medications and symptoms. She'll also give you a complete physical exam. She might ask you to take other tests, too, like an MRI, CT scan, or ultrasound to check for fluid build-up. It depends on how bad the swelling is and its cause. If an infection's to blame, for example, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Other treatments can include bandaging, proper skin care and diet, compression garments, exercises, and manual lymphatic drainage, a gentle form of skin stretching and massage. Get treated ASAP to nip potential problems in the bud. If you don't get medical care for lymphedema, it can lead to more swelling and a hardening of the tissue -- and that can impact how well your affected limb moves and works. It can also lead to infections and other illnesses. Take good care of yourself to lower your odds of getting the condition. Get Good Nutrition Cut back on foods high in salt and fat. Have at least two to four servings of fruits and three to five servings of vegetables each day. Eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients you need. Use the package label information to make healthy choices. Get fiber from whole-grain versions of breads, cereals, pasta, and rice. Fruit and veggies are good sources too. Drink plenty of water. Stay at your ideal body weight. A registered dietitian or your doctor can calculate it. Limit alcoholic drinks. Exercise Regularly First, check with your doctor before you start a new exercise program. Depending on what he gives you the OK to do, you could take walks, swim, or do low-impact aerobics like biking -- all of which are aerobic workouts that get your heart pumping. Your care team might also give you specially prescribed exercises. Whatever you do, aim to get 30 minutes of exercise a day at least 5 days a week. Include a 5-minute warm-up before any aerobic activity, and take 5-10 minutes to cool down after your workout. If your normal exercise routine includes upper-body weight lifting, check with your doctor about the best time to get back to it as well as any weight restrictions. Stop doing any exercise that gives you pain. And if your arm on the side where you had surgery becomes tired during exercise, cool down, then rest and elevate it. Avoid Infections Wear gloves while doing housework or gardening. Avoid cutting your cuticles when manicuring your nails. Use care when cutting your toenails. Wash your hands with soap and warm water often, especially before you prepare food, after you use the bathroom, or after you touch soiled linens or clothes. Protect your skin from scratches, sores, burns, and other irritations that might lead to an infection. Use electric razors to remove hair, and replace the razor head frequently. Use insect repellents to prevent bug bites. If you think have an infection, tell your doctor right away. Stay alert for these warning signs of infection: Fever over 100.4 degrees F Sweats or chills Skin rash Pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling A wound or cut that won't heal Red, warm, or draining sore Sore throat, scratchy throat, or pain when swallowing Sinus drainage, nasal congestion, headaches, or tenderness along upper cheekbones Persistent dry or moist cough that lasts more than 2 days White patches in your mouth or on your tongue Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Flu-like symptoms (chills, aches, headache, or fatigue) or generally feeling ""lousy"" Trouble peeing: pain or burning, constant urge, or needing to go often Bloody, cloudy, or foul-smelling urine Don't wear tight clothing, shoes, or jewelry. You should wear well-fitted bras. The straps shouldn't be too tight, avoid underwires, and wear pads under the bra straps if necessary. Wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes and avoid tight hosiery. Wear watches or jewelry loosely, if at all, on the affected arm. Talk with your doctor about heavy lifting with the affected arm. Slowing increasing the amount of weight you lift with your affected arm may increase strength and help lymphedema symptoms. Newer studies show that some controlled heavy lifting in a gym may be OK. Keep your skin clean. Dry your skin thoroughly (including creases and between fingers and toes) and apply lotion. Take precautions during visits to the doctor. Ask to have your blood pressure checked on the unaffected arm. Get shots or blood drawn from that arm, if possible. Tell your doctor about any symptoms. Let her know if you have redness, swelling, a skin rash, or blistering on the side of your body where you had surgery, or if you have a temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F. These warning signs of infection could be an early sign of lymphedema and should be treated immediately. Follow all of the recommendations for preventing lymphedema. That helps you lower the risk for more swelling. It's a good idea to follow these tips, too: Avoid extreme temperature changes. Do not use hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas, or steam baths. Use warm, rather than hot, water when bathing or washing dishes. Always wear sun protection (at least SPF 30) when going outdoors. Talk to your doctor before traveling. When traveling by air, ask your doctor if you should wear a compression sleeve on your affected arm or a stocking on your affected leg. For long flights, additional bandages may be needed. When sitting or sleeping, elevate your affected arm or leg on pillows. Don't spend a lot of time lying on your affected side. Your doctor may refer you to an occupational therapist ( OT) who specializes in managing lymphedema. Your OT may have you do specific exercises, limit certain activities, and possibly recommend a compression sleeve or other devices. See your doctor as recommended. With proper care and treatment, your affected limb can be restored to a normal size and shape. The condition can usually be controlled so that it doesn't get worse. But remember, it's important to get your symptoms treated as soon as possible."
51,"The root and berry of the ashwagandha plant are a traditional Ayurvedic medicine in India. Ashwagandha is used as a tonic (it is sometimes referred to as the â Indian ginsengâ) to improve physical and mental health and to treat a number of specific conditions. There's some early evidence that ashwagandha affects the immune system and helps reduce swelling, from both arthritis and fluid retention. However, the practical benefits and risks for people aren't clear yet. One study found that a compound containing ashwagandha helped relive osteoarthritis symptoms. It's not clear which of the ingredients had the benefit since ashwaganda is traditionally used in combination with other herbs. Ashwagandha might help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes and lower high cholesterol. Since ashwagandha has sedative effects, it could help ease anxiety and stress -- in fact, human studies have indicated as much. There is some preliminary research that it may help with epilepsy and memory loss, but these results are too early to say for sure if it could benefit humans. Some lab tests of cancer cells have found that ashwagandha might slow down their growth. Animal studies have found that ashwagandha could boost the effects of radiation therapy. However, these are early results. It isn't known if ashwagandha will help people with cancer. People use ashwagandha for other health conditions, including anemia. It is high in iron and has been shown to help increase hemoglobin levels. For many of the other purported uses, there isn't evidence to support ashwaganda's benefits. There is no standard dose of ashwagandha. Some people use between 1 to 6 grams of the whole herb daily. Others mix 3 grams of ashwagandha powder in warm milk. There are also standardized extracts available. Ask your doctor for advice about forms of ashwagandha and doses. In some parts of the world, people eat ashwagandha shoots, seeds, and fruit. Side effects. Since ashwagandha has not been well-studied, we don't know all of its side effects. Large doses can cause upset stomach, diarrhea, and vomiting. Risks. Talk to a doctor before using ashwagandha if you have any health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, thyroid problems, bleeding disorders, ulcers, lupus, multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Ashwagandha might interfere with thyroid tests. Stop taking ashwagandha two weeks before surgery. Interactions. If you take any drugs or supplements regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using ashwagandha supplements. They could interact with sedatives, blood thinners, thyroid supplements, drugs that suppress the immune system, and drugs for anxiety, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Ashwagandha might also interact with supplements that cause sleepiness, like St. John's wort, kava, valerian, and others. Given the serious risks, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use ashwagandha."

It's usually discovered in the first two years of life, and a child's diagnosis with Rett syndrome can feel overwhelming. Although there's no cure, early identification and treatment may help girls and families who are affected by Rett syndrome. In the past, it was felt to be part of the Autism Spectrum Disorder. We now know that it is mostly genetically based. The age when symptoms appear varies, but most babies with Rett syndrome seem to grow normally for the first 6 months before any signs of the disorder are obvious. The most common changes usually show up when babies are between 12 and 18 months, and they can be sudden or progress slowly. Symptoms of Rett syndrome: Slowed growth. The brain doesn't grow properly, and the head is usually small (doctors call this microcephaly). This stunted growth becomes clearer as the child gets older. Problems with hand movements. Most children with Rett syndrome lose the use of their hands. They tend to wring or rub their hands together. No language skills. Between ages 1 to 4, social and language skills start to decline. Children with Rett syndrome stop talking and can have extreme social anxiety. They may stay away from or not be interested in other people, toys, and their surroundings. Problems with muscles and coordination. This can make walking awkward. Trouble with breathing. A child with Rett may have uncoordinated breathing and seizures, including very fast breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhaling of air or saliva, and swallowing air. Children with Rett syndrome also tend to become tense and irritable as they get older. They may cry or scream for long periods of time, or have long fits of laughter. Symptoms of Rett syndrome usually don't improve over time. It's a lifelong condition. Often, the symptoms worsen very slowly, or don't change. It's rare for people with Rett syndrome to be able to live independently. Most children with Rett syndrome have a mutation on the X chromosome. Exactly what this gene does, or how its mutation leads to Rett syndrome, isn't clear. Researchers believe that the single gene may influence many other genes involved in development. Although Rett syndrome is genetic, children almost never inherit the faulty gene from their parents. Rather, it's a chance mutation that happens in DNA. When boys develop the Rett syndrome mutation, they rarely live past birth. Males have only one X chromosome (instead of the two girls have), so the effects of the disease are much more serious, and almost always fatal. A diagnosis of Rett syndrome is based on a girl's pattern of symptoms and behavior. Doctors can make the diagnosis based on these observations alone and by talking to the girl's parents about things like when the symptoms started. Because Rett syndrome is rare, doctors will first rule out other conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, metabolic disorders, and prenatal brain disorders. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis in 80% of girls with suspected Rett syndrome. These tests may also predict how severe it will be. Although there is no cure for Rett syndrome, there are treatments that can improve symptoms. And children should continue these treatments for their entire life. The best options available to treat Rett syndrome include: Standard medical care and medication Physical therapy Speech therapy Occupational therapy Good nutrition Behavioral therapy Supportive services Experts believe that therapy can help girls with Rett syndrome and their parents. Some girls may be able to go to school and learn better social interaction. Medicines can treat some of the problems with movement in Rett syndrome. Medication can also help control seizures. Many girls with Rett syndrome can live at least into middle age. Researchers are studying women with the disease, which was only widely recognized in the last 20 years."
53,"If your baby boy was born with a penis that doesn't look or work quite like it's supposed to, you want to know if he can be treated right away. And that's understandable. Urine and sperm travel through the urethra, the tube that opens at the tip of the penis. But boys with hypospadias are born with the location of the opening ranging anywhere within the head or shaft of penis, the scrotum, or perineum Hypospadias is pretty common and can sometimes be left as is. But doctors can do surgery to fix the problem when needed. Depending on where the opening is on your son's penis, he cmight have problems having children because his sperm might not be able to effectively fertilize an egg. Keeping it clean may be hard, too. The opening can be bigger than normal. And when it's located on the underside of the penis, it can be difficult to check on whether it's clean, or if there is redness or infection. If his hypospadias isn't corrected early, a boy may have to sit down when he pees. And if he still has it as an adult, he could have problems having children because it could be hard to direct his sperm inside a woman. As with many other birth defects, doctors aren't sure why some boys get hypospadias. They think some of the reasons could be: Genetics. It's more likely if the boy has a father or brother who were born with it. It is also associated with some genetic syndromes. Fertility treatments. The mother may have used hormone therapy or medicine to help her get pregnant.. The mother's age and weight. There's more chance a baby will be born with hypospadia if his mom is overweight and over age 35, has diabetes prior to her pregnancy Expsoure to smoking or pesticides Premature You can reduce your baby's chances of hypospadias while you're pregnant. Don't smoke or drink alcohol. Keep a healthy weight. Take 400 to 800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day (the bottle should have the dosage printed on it â 400 mcg, for example.) Visit your doctor. Doctors can identify hypospadias by examining your baby's penis. Most often it's easy to see that the opening is in the wrong place. In some cases, the penis also curves in a downward arc, something doctors call chordee. It shows during an erection. There are three kinds, depending on where the urethra opening is located: Near the head of the penis (subcoronal) Along the shaft of the penis (midshaft) Where the penis and scrotum meet, or on the scrotum (penoscrotal) If the location of the opening is near the tip, the penis often works well enough to leave it alone. But many cases of hypospadias call for surgery to move the urethra and opening. This procedure often includes straightening the penis. The goal of surgical correction is to create a penis with normal function and appearance with a urethral opening as close as possible to the ventral tip of the penis. Surgical correction should result in a properly directed urinary stream and a straightened penis upon erection. Doctors use skin from the foreskin or elsewhere on the body to repair the opening. Your doctor likely will not circumcise your son, but leave the foreskin intact for this purpose. Children who get this surgery are usually between 3 months and 18 months old. The child is anesthetized -- not awake -- during the surgery. Usually he can go home the same day. If doctors missed your son's hypospadias, it still can be treated later. It's usually obvious because of the direction his pee comes out. Surgery to fix this condition is highly successful. It is also works on adults who have the problem, but it is more difficult, and not as common."
54,"Progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR) is a deep relaxation technique that has been effectively used to control stress and anxiety, relieve insomnia, and reduce symptoms of certain types of chronic pain. Progressive muscle relaxation is based upon the simple practice of tensing, or tightening, one muscle group at a time followed by a relaxation phase with release of the tension. Doctors have used progressive muscle relaxation in combination with standard treatments for symptom relief in a number of conditions, including headaches, cancer pain, high blood pressure, and digestive disturbances. The technique of progressive muscle relaxation was described by Edmund Jacobson in the 1930s and is based upon his premise that mental calmness is a natural result of physical relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation can be learned by nearly anyone and requires only 10 minutes to 20 minutes per day to practice. Most practitioners recommend tensing and relaxing the muscle groups one at a time in a specific order, generally beginning with the lower extremities and ending with the face, abdomen, and chest. You can practice this technique seated or lying down, and you should try to practice with comfortable clothing on, and in a quiet place free of all distractions. Here is how it works; While inhaling, contract one muscle group (for example your upper thighs) for 5 seconds to 10 seconds, then exhale and suddenly release the tension in that muscle group. Give yourself 10 seconds to 20 seconds to relax, and then move on to the next muscle group (for example your buttocks). While releasing the tension, try to focus on the changes you feel when the muscle group is relaxed. Imagery may be helpful in conjunction with the release of tension, such as imagining that stressful feelings are flowing out of your body as you relax each muscle group. Gradually work your way up the body contracting and relaxing muscle groups. People who suffer from insomnia often report that practicing progressive muscle relaxation at night helps them fall asleep. Progressive muscle relaxation is also an excellent tool to help learn about the body and the signals it may be telling you. With practice and time, you can learn to accurately identify and diminish the signs and signals of stress and tension in your body."

Td is a booster vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria. It does not protect against pertussis. Tetanus enters the body through a wound or cut. It affects the brain and nervous system and causes extremely painful muscle spasms. Spasms of the jaw can make it impossible for you to open your mouth. This condition is often called ""lockjaw."" Tetanus kills one out of five people infected with the disease. Diphtheria is a very contagious infection that makes it difficult to breathe. In severe cases, it can cause heart and nerve damage. Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an extremely contagious respiratory infection that can lead to severe breathing problems, especially in infants. Pertussis first appears like an ordinary cold, but then causes intense, uncontrollable coughing spells. A ""whoop"" noise is heard when the person tries to take a breath after coughing. These diseases were once quite common in the U. S. and led to many deaths. However, routine vaccinations have helped nearly eliminate tetanus and diphtheria infections. Pertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease that continues to rise in the U. S. Before 2005, only young children could receive the pertussis vaccine. Waning immunity and inadequate vaccination -- many parents choose not to vaccinate their children -- have led to a resurgence of the disease in the U. S. in recent years. Outbreaks of pertussis among adolescents and adults have been reported in several states. Tdap vaccination offers the best prevention against pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria. Tdap stands for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids with acellular pertussis. It is marketed under the brand names Adacel and Boostrix. Tdap is an inactive vaccine, which means it is made using dead bacteria. The dead germs cannot make you sick. Tdap is not the same as DTa P, the vaccine used for children to prevent the same diseases. The CDC recommends the Tdap vaccine for all adults ages 19 and older who have never received the vaccine, especially: Health care workers who have direct contact with patients Caregivers of infants under 1 year old, including parents, grandparents, and babysitters Pregnant women in their third trimester (ideally 27th through 36th week), even if they have previously received Tdap vaccine; this can protect a newborn from whooping cough in the first months of life. New mothers who have never received the Tdap People who travel to countries where pertussis is common You may be given the Tdap vaccine if you have a severe cut or burn and have never received a dose before. Severe cuts or burns raise your risk for tetanus. The Tdap vaccine can be given any time of the year. Only one shot is needed. It may be given with other vaccinations. Tdap can be given regardless of the interval since the last Td vaccine was given. The Tdap vaccine can be used safely for those ages 65 and over, according to 2013 CDC recommendations. Tdap is given only once during your lifetime. However, you may need routine booster shots of the Td vaccine every 10 years to adequately protect you against tetanus and diphtheria. You should not receive the vaccine if you have had: A serious allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients in the past A coma or seizures within a week of receiving childhood vaccinations for pertussis (such as DTa P), unless the vaccine was not the cause; Td can be used in these cases. If you have had any of the following, talk to your doctor about whether the Tdap or Td vaccine is right for you: Epilepsy or another nervous system problem Guillain- BarrÃ© syndrome ( GBS) A history of severe swelling or pain after receiving a pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria vaccination in the past If you are moderately to severely ill (your doctor may recommend waiting to get the shot until after you recover); the CDC says you can still get the vaccine if you have a mild illness such as a cold or low-grade fever. Like all medicines, vaccines can have side effects. However, the chance of a life-threatening reaction is small. The CDC says the dangers of developing pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria far outweigh the risks of vaccination. Mild side effects of Tdap may include: Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given Mild fever Headache Tiredness Stomach upset, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Muscle aches and pains Swollen glands Mild side effects of Td may include: Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given Mild fever Headache In some people, these side effects may be more intense. They may temporarily interfere with daily activities. Severe swelling of the arm has been reported in three out of 100 people receiving either Tdap or Td. About one in 250 adults who receive the Tdap vaccine develop a fever of 102 F or higher. During clinical trials of Tdap, two adults developed temporary nervous system problems. It's unknown whether this was due to the vaccine or not. In rare cases, vaccination with Tdap or Td has led to extreme swelling of the arm where the shot was given. Although it's rare, someone may have a severe allergic reaction to an ingredient in the Tdap or Td vaccine. This generally happens in less than one in a million doses. Most of the time, such reactions occur within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine. The following can be signs of a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis: Behavior changes Breathing difficulty, including wheezing Dizziness Hoarse voice High fever Hives Pale skin Rapid heart beat Weakness Seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these signs after receiving the Tdap or Td vaccines."
56,"Like a stroke in the brain, this happens when blood flow is blocked in the retina, a thin layer of tissue in the eye that helps you see. It can cause blurry vision and even blindness. Arteries carry blood to the retina from the heart. Without blood flow, the cells in the retina don't get enough oxygen. They can start to die within minutes or hours. An eye stroke is an emergency. If you don't get treated right away, you can damage your vision permanently. Usually, the blockage comes from a blood clot. The clot may form in the retina or travel there from another part of the body. The blockage also can happen after a piece of fatty plaque plugs the artery. If you have a condition that affects the blood vessels -- including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease -- it can raise your chances of an eye stroke. Other things that make a retinal artery occlusion more likely include: Being 40 or older Being a man Smoking Trauma to the eye Damage from radiation treatments Kidney disease Clotting disorders such as sickle cell disease Birth control pills Carotid artery disease Abnormal heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation Vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessel wall Pregnancy The main sign of eye stroke is a sudden change in sight. It almost always happens in only one eye. You usually won't feel any pain. You may notice: Loss of all or part of your sight Not able to see out of side of your eyes Blurry or distorted vision Blind spots The most common type of eye stroke is called central retinal artery occlusion. It can leave you with little useful vision. You might be able to see a hand move, but not much more. Rarely, your vision might return on its own. If you have the less serious blockage in the smaller arteries, your vision may go back to normal about 80% of the time. Your doctor will check your eyes and ask about your medical history. She may ask you to read an eye chart. She'll also put drops in your eyes to open up your pupils and use an ophthalmoscope to check your retina for any blockages or bleeding. You also might have other tests: Visual field test. You look into a machine and click a button each time you see a light. It checks if you lost any peripheral vision, which is what you see out the sides of your eyes. Slit-lamp. You sit in front of a special microscope. It shines a narrow line of light in your eye so your doctor can look for anything unusual. Fluorescein angiography. Your doctor injects a harmless dye in your arm. It moves through your bloodstream to your retina. A special camera takes pictures of your eye to show which blood vessels are blocked. Optical coherence tomography. You get drops to dilate your pupils. Then a machine scans your eyes to make a detailed image of the retina. If your doctor thinks a clot from another part of the body caused the blockage, she may suggest other tests to look for problems in your arteries and heart. She also may order blood tests to check for clotting disorders and your cholesterol levels. Minutes count in order to save your vision after an eye stroke. You may avoid lasting injury if doctors can clear the central artery blockage and restore blood flows within 90-100 minutes. But after 4 hours, the blockage could damage your vision for good. Your doctor may try one or more of the following treatments: Eye massage. Your doctor will massage your closed eyelid with a finger to dislodge the clot. Carbon dioxide-oxygen. You breathe in a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen to increase blood flow to the retina. It also widens the arteries. Paracentesis. A specialist uses a small needle to remove a few drops of fluid from the front of your eye. This reduces pressure, which may increase blood flow in the retina. Medications. You may get drugs to bust clots or to lower the pressure in your eyes. These include drugs used for glaucoma, like acetazolamide ( Diamox). You usually get an eye stroke because of another medical issue, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. So keep your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels in check. If you have diabetes, get your eyes checked every year."
57,"After a night on the town, it's easy to blame a headache on one too many glasses of wine. But if you're prone to migraine headaches, drinking even a small amount of alcohol can bring on an attack. Migraine is an actual condition and migraine headaches are a symptom. The reason for it develops isn't clear. Right now, experts' best guess is that they're caused by a glitch in your brain activity. This affects the chemicals in your brain, as well as the nerve signals it sends out. Many things can trigger a migraine, from stress at work to changes in the weather and foods like aged cheese. And for about one-third of people who have these headaches, alcohol is also a trigger. Alcohol's exact role in triggering a migraine isn't fully known. Many things are probably at play. For instance, alcohol byproducts called congeners have been linked to headaches. Dark-colored alcohols like red wine, brandy, and whiskey may contain more of them. Alcohol not only contains a chemical called histamine, it also spurs your immune system to make more. This boosts inflammation throughout your body. A chemical called ethanol is alcohol's main ingredient. Once it gets into your system, it is converted into a chemical that triggers migraine. Ethanol is also a natural diuretic. That means it makes you pee more than normal. All of these things can set you up for a migraine. You might have heard that red wine is most likely to cause problems. But other drinks like sparkling wine, beer, and hard liquor may be just as likely, if not more, to cause problems. Alcohol can cause two different types of migraine headaches. You could get a headache within 30 minutes to 3 hours of drinking. You don't have to chug a large amount for this to happen. Some people only sip a glass or two of wine before their head starts to throb. Or you might be fine until after your blood alcohol level returns to normal. This is called a delayed alcohol-induced headache ( DAIH). It may not show up until the morning after you drink. This type of headache can happen to anyone, but people with migraines are more likely to get one. It can happen even if you drink less than people who don't get migraine headaches. Drinking a small amount of alcohol may be good for you. It can lower your odds of heart disease, as well as ischemic stroke. ( This type of stroke happens when a blood vessel gets blocked and blood can't reach your brain.) Still, if you're prone to migraine headaches, you'll need to be careful about how much you drink. A 5-ounce glass of wine (or 12 ounces of beer or a 1.5-fluid-ounce shot) may be OK every now and then, so long as it doesn't bring on a headache. If it does, you'll need to drink less or stay away from all alcohol. If you aren't sure that alcohol is to blame for your headaches, try keeping a diary. Each time you drink, write down the type of alcohol you have, the amount, and if and when you had a migraine. Include how you felt the prior 48 hours as well as any stress or anxiety you were under at the time. Over time, you should be able to see a pattern. A migraine each time you have a night out should be good reason to abstain. You can also try to: Have alcohol with a meal. This may lower the chance of bringing on a migraine. Don't drink when you're stressed. It's linked to a higher number of migraine headaches. Skip home hangover remedies. There's no proof that drinking raw eggs or downing hot sauce will get rid of your morning-after migraine faster. Downing more alcohol (the âhair of the dogâ theory) won't help either. Try triptans. Ask your doctor if this medicine might help. It can't prevent a migraine, but it can help stop one after it starts. Triptans work best when you take them at the early signs of a migraine. Still, they can cause serious health risks for many people."
58,"How does weight loss surgery work, and could it help you? Get answers here to frequently asked questions about weight loss surgery. Weight loss surgery is not for everyone. Doctors generally recommend it only for people who: Have a body mass index ( BMI) of 40 or more -- about 100 pounds overweight for men and 80 for women Have a lower BMI (35 to 40), but also have serious health problems related to obesity such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or severe sleep apnea Have tried and failed to lose weight by nonsurgical means such as diet and exercise Fully understand the risks associated with weight loss surgery and are motivated There are two basic types of weight loss surgery -- restrictive surgeries and malabsorptive surgeries. Each helps with weight loss in different ways. Restrictive surgeries (like adjustable gastric banding) work by physically restricting the stomach's size, limiting the amount of solid food you can eat. A normal stomach can hold about three pints of food. After weight loss surgery, a stomach may only hold one ounce of food, although over time it may be able to hold two or three ounces of food. Malabsorptive surgeries (like gastric bypass) work by changing the way your digestive system absorbs food. This type of weight loss surgery is more complicated. The surgeon removes parts of your intestine, creating a shortcut for the food to be digested. This means that fewer calories get absorbed into the body. The combined malabsorptive/restrictive surgery also creates a smaller stomach pouch, which restricts the amount of food you can eat. Gastric Banding Surgery The Pros: Gastric banding is often a minimally invasive surgery performed with small incisions, a laparoscope (a tiny camera), and special instruments. There is no need to cut into the stomach or intestine, and recovery is usually faster than with gastric bypass surgery. The surgery can be reversed by surgically removing the band. The band can be tightened or loosened in the doctor's office to control weight loss and nutritional needs. To tighten the band, saline solution is injected into the band. To loosen it, the liquid is removed with a needle. Serious complications are uncommon. But gastric bands can slip out of place, become too loose, or leak. Should this occur, additional surgery may be necessary. The Cons: Your weight loss may be less dramatic than with gastric bypass. The average loss is 40% to 50% of your excess weight -- although not in everybody. You may regain some of the weight over the years. This type of surgery has a higher rate of re-operation. Gastric Bypass Surgery The Pros: Weight loss is quick and dramatic. People lose an average of 60% to 80% of their excess body weight. Because weight loss is quick, weight-related health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis, sleep apnea, and heartburn improve quickly. Most people are able to keep at least 50% of the excess weight off long term. Loss of stomach tissue results in a drop in the so-called ""hunger hormone"" (ghrelin), which helps control appetite. The Cons: Gastric bypass surgery is riskier and is associated with more complications. The surgery may result in vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The surgery may result in dumping syndrome, which occurs when food moves too quickly through the stomach and intestines. Dumping syndrome can cause shaking, sweating, dizziness, nausea, and severe diarrhea. Gastric bypass is generally considered irreversible. The surgery permanently changes how your body digests food. Typical risks associated with weight loss surgery include: Vomiting from eating too much too quickly and not chewing well Constipation Nutritional deficiencies such as anemia and osteoporosis. As with any surgery, wound infections can occur up to three weeks after surgery. These can be treated with antibiotics, and sometimes require further surgery. Complications that may develop following weight loss surgery include: Hernia Gallstones Ulcerations Gastric prolapse Severe scarring of the new stomach pouch Excess skin that may need to be removed in an additional surgery Dehydration Hair loss Kidney stones Hypoglycemia Rare but serious complications include: Bleeding in the stool, or black stools Leaks in new connections made by weight loss surgery; these usually occur within five days of surgery. Blood clots in the lungs, called pulmonary emboli, rarely occur, but if they do, they are the most common cause of death after weight loss surgery. Blood clots can be usually prevented with blood thinning medicines and frequent activity. Blood clots in the legs, called deep vein thrombosis, or DVT Pneumonia After gastric bypass surgery, most people can expect to lose between 66% and 80% of their extra body weight. Most of this is lost within the first two years. After gastric banding, people lose 40% to 50% of their extra weight, typically within the first two years after the surgery. Obesity-related medical problems will generally improve after weight loss surgery. These include: Obstructive sleep apnea Type 2 diabetes Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) High cholesterol Degenerative joint disease or orthopedic problems High blood pressure Asthma Urinary incontinence After weight loss surgery, the body has difficulty absorbing certain important nutrients, including: Iron Vitamin B-12 Folate Calcium Vitamin D However, taking a daily multivitamin, plus other supplements, can prevent or reduce these deficiencies. Over time, some people regain weight despite bariatric surgery. Some eat high-calorie or high-fat foods instead of healthy foods -- and eat them too often. Some people rely on ""soft meals"" such as ice cream and milk shakes. The body itself may change over time, too, leading to weight gain. The digestive tract might begin absorbing more calories. Even the size of your surgical stomach can expand gradually over time. To keep the weight off, you need to work at it. Here are some tips: Eat very small meals. Adapting to small meals is challenging but necessary. Eat small amounts of food slowly, chew well, and eat lots of protein. Make nutrition a priority. You must make the foods you eat count. Good nutrition is critically important. You must also take the right supplements, as recommended by your health care provider, because serious malnutrition occurs easily following weight loss surgery. A dietitian can create a diet and nutrition plan designed to meet your needs. Exercise regularly. Many obese people aren't used to exercise, but it's very important to prevent weight regain. The good news: Once you start losing weight, exercise will get easier. As you start losing weight, you will likely be thrilled with your new appearance. However, many people who lose a lot of weight often find their skin looks loose and baggy. You may want plastic surgery to remove this excess skin. Your relationships with friends and family may indeed change after weight loss surgery. For many people, food and drink are the basis for socializing. After weight loss surgery, you must find other ways to socialize -- ways that aren't focused on food. Also, as you lose weight, the results will be obvious. People will notice, and ask you about your appearance. Prepare for these questions ahead of time -- and consider how you want to answer them. Losing a significant amount of weight is no small matter. In fact, the effects are profound and far-reaching. Life may seem disconcerting at times. You may feel odd, not quite like yourself. You may feel overwhelmed by the lifestyle changes you must make for the rest of your life. You may have reached for food as comfort -- and have difficulty giving it up. A therapist can help you get through this complicated period. A support group can also help. Ask your doctor about support groups for people who have had weight loss surgery. It helps to meet people who are making the same adjustments you're making -- and can help keep you on track with your weight loss program. A typical weight loss surgery can run from $15,000 to $25,000 -- so insurance coverage is critical for most people. Every insurance company is different, but before agreeing to cover the surgery, most insurance companies want documentation of the patient's struggle with obesity. They want a primary care doctor's records indicating that the patient has tried to lose weight through diet, exercise, and psychological counseling. Also, medical causes of obesity must be ruled out. It pays to ensure that your doctor documents your efforts early on, so surgery is an option later. Clearly, you want a bariatric surgeon who is very experienced in this specialty area. Research shows that the more experienced the surgeon, the lower the risk of death or complications during or after the surgery. To identify an excellent surgeon, collect a list of names. Ask friends and family members. Ask coworkers. You might be surprised -- lots of people often know others who have had weight loss surgery and want to share their doctor's name. Check into centers and hospitals offering educational seminars for people considering weight loss surgery. You can learn more about the actual procedure, the benefits and the risks. You may also get names of specialists who perform these surgeries. Go to these seminars and ask questions. Here are some questions to consider when choosing a bariatric surgeon: Is the specialist board certified by the American Board of Surgery? Is the specialist a member of the American Society of Bariatric Surgeons? How many weight loss surgeries has the surgeon performed? (100 or more is ideal.) How many of the surgeon's patients have died from weight loss surgery? ( Less than 1% is the average.) How often do patients have complications? What side effects are most common? What is the surgeon's success rate? Don't rush into weight loss surgery. Talk to family and friends. Talk to surgeons and to people at the hospital centers. Prepare yourself mentally and physically. Make sure you are committed to changing your lifestyle and to keeping the weight off forever."
59,"Biologics are genetically engineered proteins made from human genes. Unlike other RA medications that affect your entire immune system, biologics zero in on specific parts that control the inflammation process. Aggressive treatment can help prevent long-term disability from rheumatoid arthritis. So if you have moderate to severe RA and don't respond to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs), your doctor will probably say it's time for a biologic. You might take it alone or along with other rheumatoid arthritis medications. Abatacept ( Orencia) Adalimumab ( Humira), Adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), Adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita) Anakinra ( Kineret) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel), Etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria) Infliximab ( Remicade), Infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), Infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra) Rituximab ( Rituxan) Tocilizumab ( Actemra) Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz) There are several. They include: B-cell inhibitor: They affect B cells, which are white blood cells that carry a protein that can trigger your immune response. Interleukin-1 ( IL-1) blocker: Stops production of an inflammatory chemical your body makes Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) or interleukin-17 blocker: Stops inflammatory chemicals from attaching to cells Janus kinase ( JAK) inhibitor: Blocks proteins that trigger the inflammation process T-cell inhibitor: Blocks communication between T cells, a type of white blood cell T umor necrosis factor ( TNF) inhibitor: Blocks a chemical your body makes that drives the inflammation process Your doctor might give you a biosimilar. These are copies of existing biologics. Like generic medications, they cost less than the original. Unlike generic medications though, they aren't 100% the same. That's because biologics are made from living organisms. Don't worry, though. Drugmakers have to prove they're just as safe and effective as the original and that they work the same way. You get the same dose the same way at the same strength. You'll know your medication is a biosimilar if it has a dash after the generic name, followed by four letters. The FDA has approved these medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis. You might take a biologic alone or with another arthritis drug. As a general rule, you shouldn't take different biologic therapies at the same time. Abatacept ( Orencia): This medication works by blocking T cells. You get it in a shot every week or by IV once a month. The most common side effects include headache, a cold, a sore throat, and nausea. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita): These medications target tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You get them as a shot once every 2 weeks. The most common side effects are colds, a sinus infection, headache, and rash. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Anakinra ( Kineret): This medicine targets interleukin-1 ( IL-1). You take it as a shot once a day. The most common side effects are pain or skin reactions in the area where you get the shot, colds, headache, and nausea. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Certolizumab ( Cimzia): This biologic targets tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You take it as a shot every 2-4 weeks. ( Your doctor will decide how often you get it.) Its most common side effects are the flu or a cold, a rash, and urinary tract infections. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi): This medication targets tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You take it as a shot 1-2 times each week. The most common side effects are skin reactions or pain where you get the shot, sinus infections, and a headache. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too, Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria): These biologics target tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You'll take Simponi as a monthly shot and Simponi Aria every 8 weeks by IV. The most common side effects are a runny nose; sore throat; hoarseness or laryngitis; pain, skin reactions, or tingling where you got the shot; and viral infections like the flu and cold sores. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-abda ( Renflexis), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra): This medication targets tumor necrosis factor ( TNF). You take it by IV. Your doctor will decide on the dose and how often you should take it. The most common side effects are respiratory infections (like sinus infections and a sore throat), headache, coughing, and stomach pain. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Rituximab ( Rituxan): This medication targets B cells. You take it as an infusion by IV. Your first two infusions will be 2 weeks apart. You can repeat the infusions every 6 months. The most common side effects are reactions to the infusion, chills, infections, body aches, tiredness, and a low white blood cell count. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Tocilizumab ( Actemra): This medication targets interleukin-6 ( IL-6). You can take it by IV once a month. Or you can get shots every week or every other week. The most common side effects are a cold, sinus infection, a headache, high blood pressure, or liver problems. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis. They should check you for infections while you're taking it, too. Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz): This medicine targets Janus kinase ( JAK) proteins. You take it as a pill either once or twice a day, depending on the dosage. The most common side effects are a cold, sinus infection, headache, high blood pressure, and liver problems. Before you start taking it, your doctor should test you for infections like tuberculosis. They should check for changes to your cholesterol levels or liver enzymes and track your while blood cell count while you take it, too. The most common are pain and rash at the injection site. But they only affect a small number of people who take these drugs. Biologics can cause allergic reactions. Because they go directly into a vein, you'll get the infusion at a place where your doctor can keep an eye on you. Reaction symptoms include flu-like illness, fever, chills, nausea, and headache. As with any drugs that suppress your immune system, biologics can make you more likely to get infections and other diseases. See the doctor ASAP if you have a fever or unexplained symptoms. You may need to get vaccinations to prevent infections before you start a biologic. Don't get any while you're taking one, though. Biologics may cause some dormant chronic diseases (like tuberculosis) to flare. They may not be a good idea if you have multiple sclerosis or other conditions like severe congestive heart failure. Your doctor will give you a skin or blood test for tuberculosis before you start a biologic. You also need a test for chronic hepatitis B and C. Although animal studies of biologics show they don't affect fertility or hurt the baby, they can't always predict what will happen to humans who take the drugs. Because we don't know how they affect a developing child, pregnant women should use them only if the need is great. Your doctor will tell you to stop your biologic before surgery. You can start again when your wounds have healed and your chance of getting an infection has passed."
60,"With all the new findings on alternative medicine and natural remedies, you may wonder if there's a natural cure for asthma. Unfortunately, there is no cure for asthma at this point. In fact, it's highly advisable to avoid any treatment or product -- natural or otherwise -- that claims to be a ""cure"" for asthma. Some natural therapies may help to manage symptoms of asthma. For instance, a negative response to emotional stress can cause an asthma attack. Some natural relaxation remedies like deep abdominal breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and biofeedback can help relieve stress. Other findings suggest that diet plays a role in easing asthma symptoms. For example, it's thought that omega-3 fatty acids found naturally in high-fat fish such as salmon, mackerel, and cod let the body make more products that tend to cut inflammation. Whether this may help people who have asthma is still unproven. Many things get credit for being natural asthma remedies. But because there have been limited research studies on complementary and alternative treatments for asthma, it's not known how safe and effective these are. These natural remedies have been studied: Acupuncture. This traditional Chinese treatment involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. While some people with asthma say acupuncture eases their symptoms, there's little proof that acupuncture works as an asthma treatment. Herbs and natural dietary supplements. Many people use herbs, plants, and supplements, especially Chinese herbs, to treat asthma. Since there's no proof they help with asthma symptoms, they aren't recommended. Studies have looked at using magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidant supplements such as vitamin D and vitamins A, C, and E for asthma symptoms. Again, there isn't enough evidence to recommend these natural therapies. Yoga. Stress may trigger asthma symptoms. Breathing exercises used in yoga have been found to help some people with asthma control breathing and relieve stress, a common asthma trigger. Asthma diet. If you have a food allergy, avoiding foods that trigger an allergy attack may also help with some asthma symptoms. Biofeedback. Learning to control your heart rate may help you manage your asthma, but more studies are needed to confirm a benefit. As you consider the different types of natural asthma remedies available, it's very important to cautiously balance your desire to breathe easier with the possible dangers of the treatment, which may be unknown. Never use any natural dietary supplement without checking first with your health care provider or asthma specialist. Some natural herbal products, such as bee pollen, may trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to the specific plant. Also, never stop using your asthma drugs without your health care provider's knowledge. If you don't follow your health care provider's plan to treat your asthma, the results can be very serious, even life-threatening. If you are uncertain about the claims on a natural dietary supplement product label, call your health care provider before taking it. They can assess the product to let you know if it has any health benefits. If you don't have one already, work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan. This is something you talk about and write down. It helps you tell how well-controlled your asthma is and what to do about it. Your action plan might include: How much medicine to take and when A list of your triggers and ways to avoid them What to do when you have specific symptoms of trouble A peak flow meter is an inexpensive, hand-held gadget. You use it to measure how fast air comes out when you exhale hard after a full breath in. This number is called a peak expiratory flow, or PEF. Your doctor may want you to use a peak flow meter to help you recognize trouble. Many asthma symptoms result from not being able to move air out of your lungs. If your PEF goes down, that's a sign your asthma is getting worse and you need to do something. A diary can help you keep track of how well-controlled your asthma is. Every day, write down: Any asthma symptoms you had and how you're feeling Where you were and what you were doing right before a flare When you're using medication and how much Your PEF numbers All of this information, collected in one place, helps you and your doctor see patterns and recognize warnings of asthma attacks. You can learn to prevent them or stop them before you get very ill. Your doctor can also check your diary to see how well your asthma action plan is working. Even though there's no natural cure for asthma, your symptoms can be treated and controlled with several asthma medications. Your goal in managing asthma is to: Get an accurate asthma diagnosis. Work with your doctor to come up with an asthma action plan. Monitor your peak flow rate daily and do the right things when it drops. Keep an asthma diary so you can track all your symptoms and medication use. Avoid asthma triggers or causes of asthma, including outdoor irritants such as smog. Seek medical advice and treatment for problems that can worsen asthma symptoms, such as GERD, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis. Exercise daily to boost your aerobic fitness. Prevent exercise-induced asthma by medicating before exercise. Eat nutritious foods to boost your immune defenses against viral and bacterial infections. Stay at a normal weight. Get plenty of restful sleep. Call your health care provider at the first sign of asthma symptoms. Check in with your health care provider regularly for breathing tests to make sure your asthma is managed and your medications are working at their best. You hold the key to living well with asthma. Trust your health care provider to give you guidance, and then take daily responsibility for your breathing with proven ways to take care of yourself."
61,"The person has difficulty breathing. The upper and lower jaws don't meet properly. There is an open wound with exposed bone. The person has blurred or double vision or trouble moving his or her eyeballs. You need to see a health care provider for a facial fracture, including broken nose, jaw, cheekbone, or eye socket. Keep the person's face elevated to allow blood to drain. Apply ice for swelling. The health care provider will examine the person's face and may order X-rays or other imaging tests, including a CT scan. The health care provider may immobilize broken bones to help them heal. Medications may be prescribed to relieve pain and inflammation and prevent infection. Surgery may be needed."
62,"Making friends isn't always easy for a kid with ADHD. What can a parent do to help? Quite a bit. Treat the ADHD. The same treatments that help your child succeed in school can also help with social issues. Medicine can also cut down on behaviors like impulsiveness that may keep other kids away. Make introductions. If your child is nervous about talking to classmates, set up play dates. Plan activities ahead of time, and be there to keep an eye on things. It may help to choose something fun that your child is comfortable doing. This will encourage confidence. Keep in mind that kids with ADHD tend to do better with one or two other children than in large groups. Talk first. Before your child goes to an event, talk about what she should expect there, and what others might expect from her. Get active. Look for hobbies that center around your child's interests. It can be things like art, video games, sports, or whatever. Instead of signing up for what you think is best, let your child help you decide. Look for programs that have kids with ADHD in mind. Focus. Don't try to do too much at once. Pick one or two habits to work on with her at a time, such as taking turns or sharing. Explore social skills groups. There are programs designed to help your child learn to make friends and do better in class. A school psychologist or speech therapist usually leads them. They're also small. Typically, there aren't more than eight kids in a group. The children in these sessions do special activities, like role-playing, to learn how to: Greet other kids Start and hold a conversation Take turns when playing Ask for help when they need it Many schools have these groups. There are also privately run programs. The key is to find one that fits your child's personality and age group. Have a backup plan. Ask your child's teachers how class is going for her. Work with them and the school's guidance counselor to clear up any conflicts that could get in the way of friendships. Kids with ADHD can be targets for bullying, too. Be prepared. Talk with your child about what to do if she gets teased or picked on. Make sure she knows it's OK to tell you if she's bullied. Know that a little may be enough. Remember, while you want to encourage friendships, don't go overboard. Your child doesn't need to be part of the most popular group at school or have lots of friends. One or two close friendships may be all she needs."
63,"Kids often come down with sore, scratchy throats. Colds and other viruses are usually to blame. Irritants such as smoke in the air can also make you feel raw. Strep throat is different -- it's caused by bacteria. You need to know whether you or your child has strep or another illness so you can get the right treatment. Strep throat is an infection of the throat and tonsils. Bacteria called group Astreptococcus, also known as Streptococcus pyogenes. cause it. They live in the nose and throat. You can get the infection from someone who is sick with strep A bacteria or is a carrier of it. Like other infections, it spreads through close contact. When people who are sick cough or sneeze, they release droplets into the air that hold the bacteria. You can infect yourself if you touch something a person with strep has coughed or sneezed upon and then brush your eyes, mouth, or nose with your hand. You can also get sick if you share a glass or other personal item with someone who has strep. Strep is most common in children and teens. Adults can sometimes get it, too. A sore throat is the main sign your child has strep. Colds and other viruses can also cause a sore throat. One way to tell the difference is that a virus will often cause a runny nose, too. With strep, the sore throat comes on quickly. Your throat feels raw, and it hurts to swallow. Strep is also more likely to cause these other symptoms as well: A fever of 101 F or higher Red, swollen tonsils White patches in the throat Tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth Appetite loss Stomachache Headache Nausea, vomiting Rash Call your doctor if you or a child in your care has these symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your child's symptoms. The only sure way to tell strep from viruses that cause a sore throat is with a test. There are two kinds: Rapid strep test: It can identify a case in just a few minutes. The doctor will gently hold down your child's tongue with a depressor. Then, she will use a cotton swab to take a sample from the back of the throat. You'll get the results in 20 minutes or less. If the test is positive, which means strep is there, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat it. If the test is negative, which means the strep bacteria could not be found, the doctor might send the sample to a lab for a follow-up that takes longer. Throat culture: She will rub a swab over the throat and tonsils to be sent to the lab. If your child has strep throat, streptococci bacteria will grow in it. It usually takes about 2 days to get results from a throat culture. It can confirm whether your child has strep throat or not. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. Most treatments last for about 10 days. The medicine can make your child's symptoms go away faster and help prevent complications. Make sure your child takes all of the doses. Stopping the medicine too early can leave some bacteria alive. These can make your child sick again. Be sure to tell the doctor if your young one is allergic to any types of antibiotics. If the strep test is negative, a virus likely caused the sore throat. Your child doesn't need antibiotics because these medications don't work on viruses. Try these home treatments to ease symptoms: Gargle with a mixture of a quarter-teaspoon of salt and 8 ounces of warm water. Take ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen ( Tylenol) to bring down a fever and ease pain. Don't give aspirin to children or teens. It can cause a rare but dangerous condition called Reye's syndrome. Suck on a throat lozenge or piece of hard candy. Don't give small pieces of candy to children younger than 4. Drink warm liquids such as tea and broth. Or, suck on something cold such as an ice pop. Pass on orange juice and other drinks that have a lot of acid. They'll sting. Get lots of rest. Have your child stay home from school or daycare until the fever is gone and he has been on an antibiotic for at least 24 hours. Same for you and the workplace. Other tips: Don't share cups, dishes, forks, or other personal items with someone who's sick. Ask children to cover their mouths with a tissue or sleeve whenever they cough or sneeze. Have everyone in the house wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer many times daily. Strep complications are rare today, thanks to better diagnosis and treatment. Yet untreated strep can cause serious diseases, such as: Abscess around the tonsils or behind the throat; an abcess is a collection of pus that can be extremely painful. Rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart, brain, and joints A kidney disease called glomerulonephritis Quick treatment with antibiotics can help prevent these problems."
64,"Is it hard to see distant objects, like highway signs, until you're a few feet away, but easy to read a book up close? Chances are you're myopic, also known as nearsighted. It's a pretty common condition that your eye doctor usually can fix with eyeglasses, contacts, or eye surgery. The structure of your eye is to blame. When your eyeball is too long or the cornea -- the protective outer layer of your eye -- is too curved, the light that enters your eye won't focus correctly. Images focus in front of the retina, the light-sensitive part of your eye, instead of directly on the retina. This causes blurred vision. Doctors call this a refractive error. High myopia: It's a more serious form of the condition, where the eyeball grows more than it is supposed to and becomes very long front to back. Besides making it hard to see things at a distance, it can also raise your chance of having other conditions like a detached retina, cataracts, and glaucoma. Degenerative myopia: Also called pathological or malignant myopia, it is a rare type you usually inherit from your parents. Your eyeball gets longer very quickly and causes severe myopia, usually by the teenage or early adult years. This type of myopia can get worse far into adulthood. Besides making it hard to see things at a distance, you may have a higher chance of having a detached retina, abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye (choroid neovascularization), and glaucoma. Chances are the only symptom is that more distant objects are blurred. You may also notice: Headaches Squinting Eye strain Eye fatigue when you try to see objects more than a few feet away Children with myopia often have trouble reading the blackboard at school. An eye exam can show you if you're myopic. Glasses, contacts, or refractive surgery can usually correct the problem. When you have myopia, your prescription for glasses or contact lenses will be a negative number. The more negative the number, the stronger your lenses will be. For example, -3.00 is stronger than -2.50. Your prescription helps the eye focus light on your retina. That clears up your vision. Eye surgery can improve your vision so much you may no longer need to wear glasses or contacts. The most common procedures for myopia are: Photorefractive keratectomy: Also called PRK, this surgery uses a laser to sculpt the middle layer of your cornea. That flattens the cornea's curve and lets light rays focus closer to or on your retina. LASIK : This the most common surgery for myopia. The surgeon uses a laser or another tool to create a thin flap on the top layer of your cornea. He sculpts the cornea with another laser and moves the flap back into place. Myopia runs in families and will probably start in childhood. It stops changing after your teenage years, but not always. If you notice changes in your vision, get your eyes checked. See your eye doctor every year."
65,"The hepatitis C virus can be transmitted only through blood. But exposure to tiny amounts of blood is enough to infect you. Here are some steps you can take to help prevent becoming infected with hepatitis C. Never share needles. Intravenous drug users have the highest chance of getting infected with hepatitis C because many share needles. Besides needles, the virus may be present in other equipment used with illicit drugs. Even sharing a straw or dollar bill when snorting cocaine could transmit hepatitis C. Bleeding in the nose frequently happens when taking cocaine this way, and microscopic droplets may enter the straw and be passed on to the next user, even if they can't be seen. Avoid direct exposure to blood or blood products. If you are a medical worker or health care provider, avoid coming into direct contact with blood. Any tools that draw blood in the workplace should be thrown out safely or sterilized to prevent hepatitis C infection. Don't share personal care items. Many items that we use on a daily basis will occasionally be exposed to blood. Often, people will cut themselves while shaving, or their gums will bleed while brushing their teeth. Even small amounts of blood can infect someone, so it is important not to share items such as toothbrushes, razors, nail and hair clippers, and scissors. If you already have hepatitis C, make sure you keep your personal items, such as razors and toothbrushes, separate and out of children's reach. Choose tattoo and piercing parlors carefully. Only use a licensed tattoo and piercing artist who does the right sanitary procedures. A new, disposable needle and ink well should be used for each customer. If in doubt, ask about their disposable products and sanitary procedures before getting a tattoo or piercing. Practice safe sex. It is rare for hepatitis C to be transmitted through sexual intercourse, but there is a higher chance of getting hepatitis C if you have HIV, another sexually transmitted disease, multiple sex partners, or if you engage in rough sex. Hepatitis C is not known to spread by casual contact, kissing, hugging, breastfeeding, sharing eating utensils, coughing, or sneezing. If a mom has hepatitis C and her nipples are cracked and bleeding, she should stop nursing until her nipples have healed. Then she can resume nursing. One of the main problems with preventing hepatitis C is that most people who are infected don't show symptoms at first. Many only find out when they have a blood test for an unrelated reason. Until relatively recently, this often led to infected blood and organs being used in transfusions and transplants. As of July 1992, all blood and organ donations are screened for the hepatitis C virus. Although not perfect, only about 1 in 2 million blood transfusions may transmit hepatitis C. Anyone who received a blood transfusion or organ donation before July 1992 should be tested for the virus. As of 1987, all blood products for the treatment of hemophilia are treated to remove infectious viruses, such as hepatitis C and HIV. But if you took any blood products before 1987, you should be tested for hepatitis C. There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C infection. Researchers at Canada's University of Alberta, the U. K.'s Oxford University, and the University of Ulsan in South Korea are looking into it, and clinical trials are underway in the U. S. But if you have it, you should get vaccinated for hepatitis A and hepatitis B."
66,"There are no warning signs of early prostate cancer. You can't feel the growing tumor pushing against anything else, so there's no pain. You can have the disease and not know it for years. That's why regular prostate cancer screenings are so important. Once a tumor causes the prostate gland to swell, or once cancer spreads beyond the prostate, the following symptoms may happen: The need to pee often, especially at night Trouble starting or stopping a stream of urine A weak stream, or one that starts and stops Leaking when you laugh or cough Not being able to pee standing up Pain or burning when you pee Pain or burning when you ejaculate Less fluid when you ejaculate Blood in your pee or semen Pressure or pain in your rectum Pain or stiffness in your lower back, hips, pelvis, or thighs A decrease in the amount of fluid ejaculated New trouble getting an erection These aren't symptoms of the cancer itself. They result from the cancer growth blocking your prostate. Other causes include an enlarged, noncancerous prostate or a urinary tract infection. Symptoms of advanced prostate cancer include: Dull, deep pain or stiffness in the pelvis, lower back, ribs, or upper thighs; pain in the bones of those areas Loss of weight and appetite Fatigue, nausea, or vomiting Swelling of the lower extremities Weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, often with constipation Bowel problems You have trouble urinating or find that urination is painful or different from normal; your doctor should examine your prostate gland to determine whether it is enlarged, inflamed with an infection, or cancerous. You have chronic pain in your lower back, pelvis, upper thighbones, or other bones. Pain in these areas can be caused by different things, including the spread of prostate cancer. You have unexplained weight loss. You have swelling in your legs. You have weakness in your legs or a hard time walking, especially if you also have constipation."
67,"Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times.

Central sleep apnea: Unlike OSA, the airway is not blocked, but the brain fails to signal the muscles to breathe, due to instability in the respiratory control center. Sleep apnea can affect anyone at any age, even children. Risk factors for sleep apnea include: Being male Being overweight Being over age 40 Having a large neck size (17 inches or greater in men and 16 inches or greater in women) Having large tonsils, a large tongue, or a small jaw bone Having a family history of sleep apnea Nasal obstruction due to a deviated septum, allergies, or sinus problems If left untreated, sleep apnea can increase the risk of health problems, including: High blood pressure Stroke Heart failure, irregular heart beats, and heart attacks Diabetes Depression Worsening of ADHD Headaches In addition, untreated sleep apnea may be responsible for poor performance in everyday activities, such as at work and school, motor vehicle crashes, and academic underachievement in children and adolescents."
68,"When you think of child abuse, your first thought may be of a child with bruises or other marks that raise red flags. But the signs aren't always so clear. It can be physical, sexual, or emotional. She may be neglected, meaning her caregivers don't provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. She may be reluctant to say something because she may want to protect that person or is afraid of what they will do if she speaks up. It's important to know how to recognize different types of abuse, and what you can do if you suspect it. Child abuse happens when someone harms a child's body or emotional health, development, and well-being. There are 4 main types. Physical abuse means that someone hurts a child's body or puts her in physical danger. It doesn't matter if the child gets seriously hurt or if it leaves a mark. Any harm is abuse. It includes when someone: Burns a child Hits, kicks, or bites Holds the child under water Shakes or throws the child Throws objects at the child Ties up the child Sexual abuse is any kind sexual activity with a child, not just physical contact. It includes when someone: Forces a child to take part in pornographic pictures or videos Has any sexual contact with the child, from kissing in a sexual way to having sex Makes phone calls or sends emails, texts, or other messages that are sexual in any way Shows the child someone else's genitals, as with âflashingâ Shows pornography Tells âdirtyâ jokes or stories Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviors that harm a child's emotional well-being and development. This can mean when someone: Abuses others when the child is around, such as a parent, brother, sister, or pet Fails to show love and affection Ignores the child and doesn't give emotional support and guidance Shames, belittles, criticizes, or embarrasses Teases, threatens, bullies, or yells Neglect is when a caregiver doesn't give the child basic care and protection, such as: Clothing Food Heat in cold weather Housing with clean living conditions Medical care Neglect is also when someone leaves the child alone for long stretches of time or under dangerous conditions. Abuse can be hard to recognize. Kids can get cuts and bruises or show signs of stress for lots of reasons that are a normal part of childhood. So it helps to know specific signs to look for, and trust your gut as you look at the whole picture of the child's physical and emotional health. Signs of physical abuse may include: Bruises, welts, or other injuries that can't be explained or don't match with the child's story Burns, especially from cigarettes, that can't be explained Injury marks that have a pattern, like from a hand, belt, or other objects Injuries that are at different stages of healing Medical or dental issues that go untreated Kids who've been physically abused may also: Avoid any kind of touch or physical contact Be afraid to go home Seem to always be on high alert Wear clothing that doesn't match the weather -- such as long sleeves on hot days -- to cover up bruises Withdraw from friends and activities Signs of sexual abuse may include: Avoiding a certain person for no clear reason Bloody, torn, or stained underwear Bruising or bleeding around the genitals Pain or itching around the genitals that might cause problems walking or sitting Pregnancy or STDs, especially for boys and girls under 14 years old Refusing to change clothes in front of others Running away from home Sexual activity or knowledge that people usually have only when they're older Signs of emotional abuse may include: Constant worry about doing something wrong Speech problems or delays in learning and emotional development Depression and low self-esteem Doing poorly in school Extreme behavior, such as being way too obedient or way too demanding Headaches and stomachaches with no clear cause The child doesn't seem close to a parent or caregiver Showing little interest in friends and activities Signs of neglect may include: Always looking dirty Being left alone or in the care of other young children Eating more than usual at a meal or saving food for later Doesn't get medical, dental, or mental health care Missing a lot of school Poor weight gain and growth If you suspect child abuse, it's important to report it. It isn't a private matter or a family problem. A child's physical and emotional well-being, and maybe even her life, could be at stake. You don't need proof to report abuse. If you suspect it, call your local child protective services, police, a hospital, or a hotline, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-422-4453. You don't have to give your name. Depending on the situation, there are many ways you can help the child: If he needs medical care right away, call 911. Take him to the hospital -- it's a haven for abused children. Doctors can check for signs of abuse and give medical care. If you think someone like a baby sitter or day-care worker has abused your child, keep her away from that person and contact police. Help the child get therapy to start healing the emotional damage of the abuse. Make sure she feels supported and knows this is not her fault. It's best to not confront the abuser yourself. Instead, contact police and let them handle it."
69,"You've noticed your child squints. Does she have a vision problem? It can be a sign of nearsightedness, or myopia, as your doctor would call it. Nearsightedness is just one of several common childhood vision problems. One out of every 4 kids has trouble with eyesight. Often, parents don't know there's a problem. That's why all children should get regular eye exams. Her eyes cross or don't line up with each other. It might be: Eyes that aren't aligned (strabismus). What to do: Take her to a pediatric ophthalmologist. He may put a patch over the stronger eye to strengthen the weaker one, or prescribe special glasses or eye exercises. She has trouble seeing things far away. It might be: Nearsightedness, or myopia. What to do: Get her vision checked. Eyeglasses or contact lenses can improve distance vision. She can't things close up. It might be: Farsightedness, or hyperopia. What to do: Get her eyeglasses or contact lenses to help with close-up vision. Her vision is blurry. It might be: A problem called astigmatism. It means the cornea of her eye is curved and can't focus on images clearly. What to do: Take her for an eye exam to see if eyeglasses would help. Some kids have a lazy eye. You might hear her doctor call it amblyopia. She may not have symptoms. But the doctor should be able to spot it during a regular eye exam. He can usually correct (or improve) it if he finds and treats it early enough. She may have to wear an eye patch on her stronger eye. It's rare, but some kids need surgery to align their eyes. Less common problems include: Glaucoma : A group of diseases that damage the eye's main nerve. It's more common later in life, but some children are born with glaucoma or develop it as they grow. Cataracts: These cloud the lens of your eye. They're also more common in older adults. But some children are born with them or get them from diabetes or childhood diseases. Retinoblastoma : A rare cancer of the retina. Kids with vision problems will show some similar behaviors. Most of the time, they squint. You child might be having trouble with her sight if she: Complains about headaches or blurry vision Closes one eye Rubs her eyes Complains about pain in one or both eyes Has an eye that turns in, out, up, down, or wanders Has eyes that cross or can't focus Holds books really close to see the words If you spot one of these symptoms, make an appointment with her pediatrician or an eye doctor. Getting a checkup right away can let the doctor find vision problems before they can affect her sight -- and school performance. It's very important to watch your child, since many kids don't know something is wrong! Glasses are usually the solution for kids who are nearsighted, farsighted, or have astigmatism. To get your child fitted, see an eye specialist. Plastic frames and shatter-proof polycarbonate lenses are best for active kids. Let your child pick her own frames -- it can help her feel involved. Make the process fun. If she hears negative comments about glasses, she probably won't want to wear them. LASIK and other vision correction surgeries are generally not an option for kids younger than 18. Their prescription and eye growth haven't stabilized. In rare cases, LASIK is used for children with severe vision problems that don't improve with glasses or contacts."
70,"For those with diabetes, an insulin shot delivers medicine into the subcutaneous tissue -- the tissue between your skin and muscle. Subcutaneous tissue (also called ""sub Q"" tissue) is found throughout your body. Please follow these steps when using an insulin syringe. Note: these instructions are not for patients using an insulin pen or a non-needle injection system. Select a clean, dry work area, and gather the following insulin supplies: Bottle of insulin Sterile insulin syringe (needle attached) with wrapper removed Two alcohol wipes (or cotton balls and a bottle of rubbing alcohol) One container for used equipment (such as a hard plastic or metal container with a screw-on or tightly secured lid or a commercial ""sharps"" container) Wash hands with soap and warm water and dry them with a clean towel. Remove the plastic cap from the insulin bottle. Roll the bottle of insulin between your hands two to three times to mix the insulin. Do not shake the bottle, as air bubbles can form and affect the amount of insulin withdrawn. Wipe off the rubber part on the top of the insulin bottle with an alcohol pad or cotton ball dampened with alcohol. Set the insulin bottle nearby on a flat surface. Remove the cap from the needle. If you've been prescribed two types of insulin to be taken at once (mixed dose), skip to the instructions in the next section. Draw the required number of units of air into the syringe by pulling the plunger back. You need to draw the same amount of air into the syringe as insulin you need to inject. Always measure from the top of the plunger. Insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the insulin bottle. Push the plunger down to inject air into the bottle (this allows the insulin to be drawn more easily). Leave the needle in the bottle. Turn the bottle and syringe upside-down. Be sure the insulin covers the needle. Pull back on the plunger to the required number of units (measure from the top of the plunger). Check the syringe for air bubbles. Air bubbles in the syringe will not harm you if they are injected, but they can reduce the amount of insulin in the syringe. To remove air bubbles, tap the syringe so the air bubbles rise to the top and push up on the plunger to remove the air bubbles. Recheck the dose and add more insulin to the syringe if necessary. Remove the needle from the insulin bottle. Carefully replace the cap on the needle. Your doctor may prescribe two types of insulin to be injected at once for diabetes. This mixed dose may provide better blood sugar control for some people. Please follow these steps when injecting a mixed dose of insulin: Follow the preparation steps described above for both bottles of insulin. Draw the required number of units of air into the syringe by pulling the plunger back. Draw air into the syringe equal to the amount of cloudy (intermediate or long-acting) insulin needed. Always measure from the top of the plunger (the edge closest to the needle). Insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the cloudy insulin bottle. Push the plunger down to inject air into the bottle (this allows the insulin to be drawn more easily). Do not withdraw the insulin into the syringe at this time. Take the needle out of the bottle. Draw the required number of units of air into the syringe by pulling the plunger back. Draw air into the syringe equal to the amount of clear (short-acting) insulin needed. Always measure from the top of the plunger. Insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the clear insulin bottle. Push the plunger down to inject air into the bottle (this allows the insulin to be drawn more easily). Turn the bottle and syringe upside-down. Be sure the insulin covers the needle. Pull back on the plunger to the required number of units of clear insulin needed (measure from the top of the plunger, the edge closest to the needle). Check the syringe for air bubbles. Air bubbles in the syringe will not harm you if they are injected, but they can reduce the amount of insulin in the syringe. To remove air bubbles, tap the syringe so the air bubbles rise to the top and push up on the plunger to remove the air bubbles. Recheck the dose and add more insulin to the syringe if necessary. Remove the needle from the clear insulin bottle and insert it into the rubber stopper of the cloudy insulin bottle. Turn the bottle and syringe upside-down. Be sure the insulin covers the needle. Pull back on the plunger to the required number of total units of insulin needed (measure from the top of the plunger). Important: This must be an exact measurement. If you withdraw too much cloudy insulin, the total dosage in the syringe must be discarded. Be careful not to push any of the clear insulin from the syringe into the cloudy insulin. If there are large air bubbles after mixing the insulin in the syringe, discard this dosage and start the procedure again. Do not push the insulin back into the bottle. Carefully replace the cap on the needle. You are now ready to inject the insulin. Follow the steps listed below. Because you will be injecting insulin on a regular basis for diabetes, you need to know where to inject it and how to rotate (move) your injection sites. By rotating your injection sites, you will make your injections easier, safer, and more comfortable. If the same injection site is used over and over again, you may develop hardened areas under the skin that keep the insulin from being used properly. Important: Only use the sites on the front of your body for self-injection. Any of the sites may be used if someone else is giving you the injection. Follow these guidelines: Ask your doctor, nurse, or health educator which sites you should use. Move the site of each injection. Inject at least 1 1/2 inches away from the last injection site. Try to use the same general injection area at the same time of each day (for example, use the abdomen for the injection before lunch). Note: The abdomen absorbs insulin the fastest, followed by the arms, thighs, and buttocks. Keep a record of which injection sites you have used. Choose an injection site for your insulin shot. Do not inject near joints, the groin area, navel, the middle of the abdomen, or near scars. Clean the injection site (about 2 inches of your skin) in a circular motion with an alcohol wipe or a cotton ball dampened with rubbing alcohol. Leave the alcohol wipe or cotton ball nearby. Using the hand you write with, hold the barrel of the syringe (with the needle end down) like a pen, being careful not to put your finger on the plunger. Remove the needle cap. With your other hand, gently pinch a two- to three-inch fold of skin on either side of the cleaned injection site. Insert the needle with a quick motion into the pinched skin at a 90-degree angle (straight up and down). The needle should be all the way into your skin. Push the plunger of the syringe until all of the insulin is out of the syringe. Quickly pull the needle out. Do not rub the injection site. You may or may not bleed after the injection. If you are bleeding, apply light pressure with the alcohol wipe. Cover the injection site with a bandage if necessary. Do not cap the needle. Drop the entire syringe and needle into your container for used ""sharps"" equipment. When the container is full, put the lid or cover on it and throw it away with the trash. Do NOT put this container in the recycling bin. Some communities have specific disposal laws. Check with your local health department for specific disposal instructions in your community."
71,"Has a serious injury Is unconscious Call 911 if: The person has a serious injury or is unconscious. A knocked-out permanent tooth is a dental emergency. Knocked-out teeth can be re-implanted in many cases. A permanent tooth that is re-implanted within 30 minutes has the highest chance of success. Handle teeth carefully because damage may prevent re-implantation. Touch only the crown, the top part of the tooth. Do not touch the root of the tooth. Rinse the tooth gently in a bowl of lukewarm water for no more than 10 seconds only if there is dirt or foreign matter on it. Do not scrub, scrape, or use alcohol to remove dirt. Rinse mouth with warm water. If possible, reinsert permanent teeth into the correct sockets and have the person bite on a gauze pad to hold teeth in place. If you can't reinsert permanent teeth, or for baby teeth or teeth fragments, store them in whole milk or between your cheek and gum to prevent drying. Control bleeding with sterile gauze or cloth. For pain and swelling, apply a cool compress. Encourage a child to suck on a frozen pop. For pain, take ibuprofen or acetaminophen. For teeth that have been knocked out, see a dentist or go to an emergency room immediately. Take the teeth or teeth fragments with you. Even if the teeth have been successfully reinserted, you should see a dentist. For chipped or broken teeth, call a dentist."
72,"Salicylates are chemicals found in plants and are a major ingredient in aspirin and other pain-relieving medications. They're also naturally in many fruits and vegetables, as well as in many common health and beauty products. These vary but may include: Asthma-like symptoms, such as trouble breathing and wheezing Headaches Nasal congestion Changes in skin color Itching, skin rash, or hives Swelling of the hands, feet, and face Stomach pain In severe cases, a salicylate allergy can lead to anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening reaction that is an emergency. The content of salicylates can vary from one item to another and even among batches of the same item from the same source. Some people are more sensitive to these chemicals than others. People with a low tolerance may have an allergic reaction if they get more than a small amount of salicylate. If you're allergic to salicylates, you'll need to avoid items that have them. They're in a variety of foods, medications, and cosmetics, including: Foods That Contain Salicylates Products That May Contain Salicylates Salicylate- Containing Ingredients Fruits such as apples, avocados, blueberries, dates, kiwi fruit, peaches, raspberries, figs, grapes, plums, strawberries, cherries, grapefruit, and prunes Vegetables such as alfalfa, cauliflower, cucumbers, mushrooms, radishes, broad beans, eggplant, spinach, zucchini, broccoli, and hot peppers Some cheeses Herbs, spices, and condiments such as dry spices and powders, tomato pastes and sauces, vinegar, and soy sauce, jams, and jellies Drinks such as coffee, wine, beer, orange juice, apple cider, regular and herbal tea, rum, and sherry Nuts such as pine nuts, peanuts, pistachios, and almonds Some candies, such as peppermints, licorice, and mint-flavored gum and breath mints Ice cream, gelatin Fragrances and perfumes Shampoos and conditioners Herbal remedies Cosmetics such as lipsticks, lotions, and skin cleansers Mouthwash and mint-flavored toothpaste Shaving cream Sunscreens or tanning lotions Muscle pain creams Alka- Seltzer Pepto- Bismol Aspirin Acetylsalicylic acid Artificial food coloring and flavoring Benzoates Hydrobenzoic acid Magnesium salicylate Menthol Mint Salicylic acid Peppermint Phenylethyl salicylate Sodium salicylate Spearmint"
73,"Your thyroid is a small gland in front of your neck that makes hormones that help control just about every organ. When your thyroid doesn't make enough of these hormones, your body can't work right. That can affect your energy level, mood, and weight. If your thyroid becomes inflamed, you have thyroiditis. Sometimes it happens because your body makes antibodies that attack your thyroid by mistake. This condition is called autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or Hashimoto's disease. Doctors don't fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes. You may be more likely to get autoimmune thyroiditis if you: Are a woman Are middle-aged Have another autoimmune disorder like lupus, type 1 diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis Are related to someone who has autoimmune thyroiditis Have been exposed to environmental radiation You may not have any in the beginning. As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. It may not hurt. Left alone, the thyroid will eventually shrink on its own, but that doesn't mean you're cured. That just means your thyroid is damaged. A damaged thyroid can't do its job, which leads to hypothyroidism -- too little of the thyroid hormones. Symptoms can include: Tiredness Sensitivity to cold Puffy face Trouble pooping Enlarged tongue Pale, dry skin and brittle nails Hair loss Weight gain Muscle aches and joint pain Depression Memory lapse Heavy menstrual bleeding Your doctor will order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies. You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren't clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don't have any symptoms, especially if they're aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems. The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine ( Levo- T, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, Unithroid). It's a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes. Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while. You'll need to take medicine for the rest of your life. Some foods, like a high-fiber diet or soy products, can mess with levothyroxine. You should also let your doctor know if you take: Iron supplements A cholesterol medicine called cholestyramine ( Locholest, Prevalite, Questran) Antacids that have aluminium hydroxide An ulcer medicine called sucralfate ( Carafate) Calcium supplements"
74,"Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) isn't life threatening, but it can threaten your quality of life. How do you know when it's time to see a doctor about excessive sweating? How can you tell if your sweating is excessive? No one can say how much sweat is ""too much."" There's really no effective and convenient way to measure the total amount of sweat. Excessive sweating is instead defined as any amount of sweating that causes problems or distress. The exact causes aren't known, but up to 3% of people suffer from hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis usually starts in adolescence or young adulthood. Sweating is worst in the palms, soles, or underarms. When excessive sweating is limited to these areas, it's called focal hyperhidrosis. Most people with focal hyperhidrosis are otherwise completely healthy. Studies suggest that they are no more nervous or easily upset than people who sweat normally. At the same time, hyperhidrosis can cause real problems. Most people feel extremely embarrassed by their excess sweating. They frequently report frustrations or problems with things most people take for granted: Frequently changing clothing because of underarm sweating Avoiding shaking hands Missing out on social gatherings due to concern about sweating Challenges with romantic relationships Difficulty writing because the pen slips or sweat soaks through ink on the page In fact, about one-third of people with focal hyperhidrosis describe their symptoms as significantly affecting their quality of life. Despite the serious negative impact hyperhidrosis has on the lives of those who suffer from it, most never seek treatment. Generally, people with focal hyperhidrosis have been living with their problem since they were young. After learning to live with excessive sweating, they often don't recognize their problem is treatable. That's too bad, because effective hyperhidrosis treatments are available. Although no treatment is perfect, hyperhidrosis medications and procedures can help many people with the condition. Some primary care physicians or general practitioners are familiar with the initial treatment of focal hyperhidrosis, which may include: Over-the-counter ( OTC) antiperspirants: these can be applied to the hands and feet, as well as the armpits. Hyperhidrosis that's controllable by OTC treatment doesn't need a doctor's visit. Antiperspirants can even be used at bedtime. Prescription antiperspirants: Most people with hyperhidrosis will sweat through OTC antiperspirants. A doctor can prescribe a higher-strength, aluminum salt-based antiperspirant. This can be effective for mild cases of excessive sweating. Dermatologists are generally the best doctors for treating excessive sweating that's not controlled by OTC products. They are usually more familiar with hyperhidrosis treatment, especially when sweating is severe. Depending on your insurance, you may need a referral to a dermatologist from your regular doctor. Some more advanced treatments for hyperhidrosis include: Iontophoresis: This involves soaking the hands or feet in a basin of water through which a mild electric current is passed. It requires frequent treatments, but it's often effective at reducing sweating. Botulinum toxin type A ( Botox): Injections of this anti-wrinkle drug turn off sweat glands of the underarms for months at a time. Botox is more than 90% effective as a hyperhidrosis medication. The injections can be painful, though, sometimes requiring local anesthesia. mira Dry system: This device uses electromagentic energy to permanently eliminate underarm sweat glands. It is not approved for use on other areas of the body. Oral hyperhidrosis medications can also reduce excessive sweating, although side effects frequently limit their use. In extreme cases, referral to a surgeon is an option. Surgical procedures are available to treat hyperhidrosis and can be quite effective. They often have serious side effects, though, and are considered a last resort. Focal hyperhidrosis isn't medically serious. Other forms of excessive sweating, though, can signal underlying medical problems. Sweating all over the body at once is called generalized hyperhidrosis. It's frequently caused by diseases affecting the whole body. Infections, hormone problems, cancer, or nerve problems can be responsible. It often occurs during sleep, unlike focal hyperhidrosis, which occurs only when awake. Anyone with all-over body sweating should see a doctor as soon as possible."
75,"A pleural effusion is an unusual amount of fluid around the lung. Many medical conditions can lead to it, so even though your pleural effusion may have to be drained, your doctor likely will target the treatment at whatever caused it. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The pleura is a thin membrane that lines the surface of your lungs and the inside of your chest wall. When you have a pleural effusion, fluid builds up in the space between the layers of your pleura. Normally, only teaspoons of watery fluid are in the pleural space, which allows your lungs to move smoothly in your chest cavity when you breathe. A wide range of things can cause a pleural effusion. Some of the more common ones are: Leaking from other organs. This usually happens if you have congestive heart failure, when your heart doesn't pump blood to your body properly. But it can also come from liver or kidney disease, when fluid builds up in your body and leaks into the pleural space. Cancer. Usually lung cancer is the problem, but other cancers that have spread to the lung or pleura can cause it, too. Infections. Some illnesses that lead to pleural effusion are pneumonia or tuberculosis. Autoimmune conditions. Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis are some diseases that can cause it. Pulmonary embolism. This is a blockage in an artery in one of your lungs, and it can lead to pleural effusion. You might not have any. You're more likely to have symptoms when a pleural effusion is moderate or large-sized, or if there is also inflammation. If you do have symptoms, they may include: Shortness of breath Chest pain, especially when breathing in deeply ( This is called pleurisy or pleuritic pain.) Fever Cough Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and give you a physical exam. She'll tap on your chest and listen with a stethoscope. To confirm you have a pleural effusion, you'll need to get imaging tests such as: Chest X-ray. Pleural effusions appear white on X-rays, while air space looks black. If a pleural effusion is likely, you may get more X-ray films while you lie on your side. These can show if the fluid flows freely within the pleural space. Computed tomography ( CT scan). A CT scanner takes many X-rays quickly, and a computer constructs images of the entire chest -- inside and out. CT scans show more detail than chest X-rays do. Ultrasound. A probe on your chest will create images of the inside of your body, which show up on a video screen. Your doctor may use the ultrasound to locate the fluid so they can get a sample for analysis. Also, your doctor might do a procedure called thoracentesis. They'll take a little bit of the fluid to test. To do this, they insert a needle and a tube called a catheter between your ribs, into the pleural space. You may hear your doctor use the terms ""transudative"" and ""exudative"" to describe the two main types of pleural effusions. Transudative. This pleural effusion fluid is similar to the fluid you normally have in your pleural space. It forms from liquid leaking across normal pleura. This type rarely needs to be drained unless it's very large. Congestive heart failure is the most common cause of this type. Exudative. This forms from extra liquid, protein, blood, inflammatory cells or sometimes bacteria that leak across damaged blood vessels into the pleura. You may need to get it drained, depending on its size and how much inflammation there is. The causes of this type include pneumonia and lung cancer. Your doctor may need to treat only the medical condition that caused the pleural effusion. You would get antibiotics for pneumonia, for instance, or diuretics for congestive heart failure. Large, infected, or inflamed pleural effusions often need to get drained to help you feel better and prevent more problems. Procedures for treating pleural effusions include: Thoracentesis. If the effusion is large, your doctor may take more fluid than she needs for testing, just to ease your symptoms. Tube thoracostomy (chest tube). Your doctor makes a small cut in your chest wall and puts a plastic tube into your pleural space for several days. Pleural drain. If your pleural effusions keep coming back, your doctor may put a long-term catheter through your skin into the pleural space. You can then drain the pleural effusion at home. Your doctor will tell you how and when to do that. Pleurodesis. Your doctor injects an irritating substance (such as talc or doxycycline) through a chest tube into the pleural space. The substance inflames the pleura and chest wall, which then bind tightly to each other as they heal. Pleurodesis can prevent pleural effusions from coming back in many cases. Pleural decortication. Surgeons can operate inside the pleural space, removing potentially dangerous inflammation and unhealthy tissue. To do this, your surgeon may make small cuts (thoracoscopy) or a large one (thoracotomy)."
76,"You want to lose weight and keep it off for good. These five strategies will help you do just that. Most people trying to lose weight only focus on their ultimate goal: dropping pounds. But it's important not to lose sight of the diet and exercise changes that will get you there. Choose two or three diet and exercise goals at a time that you are willing to take on. And make sure they are specific and realistic. For example, ""exercise more"" is a wonderful goal, but it's not specific. "" Walk 5 miles every day"" is specific and measurable. But is it realistic if you're just starting out? "" Walk 30 minutes every day"" is better, but what happens if work or weather interferes? "" Walk 30 minutes for 5 days each week"" is specific and realistic. Are there situations that make you want to eat more? Start noticing them. For example, you may learn that you're more likely to overeat while you're bored or stressed. Then figure out ways to get around those triggers. Do something else to soothe your stress, for instance. Also, you might want to put treats away. You're more likely to eat them if they're visible and easy to get to. That's right: You should feel full. But how you do that might surprise you. It's mostly about time: 15 minutes, to be specific. You need at least that much time to feel full. So eat slower, giving your brain enough time to notice that you've eaten. What you eat can also help. Think fiber (like fruits and veggies) to fill up. Another trick is to use smaller plates so that small portions do not appear too small. Also, changing your eating schedule can help you reach your goal, especially if you tend to skip or delay meals and overeat later. A good reward is something that is desirable, timely, and depends on meeting your goal. Rewards may include treating yourself to a movie or massage, taking an afternoon off from work, or giving an hour of time to yourself. Keep in mind that many small rewards, given for meeting small goals, can work better than bigger rewards for long, difficult goals. Jot down things like how much you exercise and what you eat. There are many apps that can help. Doing this can really open your eyes to what you are doing and what you need to do to meet your weight loss goals."
77,"Maybe your scalp stings a little when you color your hair. Or the new shampoo you're using makes it burn. Or maybe your scalp just started itching for no reason you can think of. It's not surprising that scalps sometimes itch, sting, or feel prickly. Though your skull is hard, your scalp is quite tender. It has more blood vessels than any other area of the body and lots of nerve endings. Here are some common causes of scalp problems and what you can do about them. Treatments that color, bleach, or straighten your hair are the most likely hair products to irritate your scalp. If you use heat during processing -- to help lighten hair, for example -- the irritation can be worse. What helps: Always do a patch test to see how your skin reacts before using a new hair product. If it stings or itches, try a different brand. If you're coloring your hair, try a semi-permanent color or a rinse. Permanent color has an ingredient called PPDA that can cause an allergic reaction. To limit exposure to harsh chemicals, retouch the roots instead of doing all-over color every time. Or highlight instead of lightening all over. Fragrances and preservatives in shampoo irritate some people's skin. Not rinsing out shampoo well can also cause itching. What helps: Switch to a new shampoo. Look for fragrance-free, organic shampoo for color-treated hair or mild ""baby"" shampoos. Be sure to give your hair a good rinse. Winter weather can make your scalp flake and itch, especially if you live in a cold, dry climate. This usually goes away in summer, unless it's very hot and humid. Hot and humid weather can make scalps feel prickly. What helps: Try to keep indoor temperatures ""just right"" -- not too warm or too cool. Wash your hair less in winter to keep in oils and moisture that protect your scalp. Yes, your scalp can burn, too. If your hair is thin or you're bald, the sun can also damage your topmost skin over time, making it rough, dry, and scaly. This condition, solar keratosis, raises your risk of skin cancer. What helps: Wear a hat outside. Use spray sunscreen where you part your hair, or apply sunscreen on your head if you're bald, even on cloudy days. Make sure it's SPF 30 or higher and broad-spectrum. When your scalp's dead skin cells shed at a super-fast rate, you get itchy flakes. No one's sure what causes dandruff; it may be hormones. What helps: Shampoo often to get rid of dead skin cells. Leave the lather on your scalp for a few minutes before rinsing off. Every other hair washing, use dandruff shampoo. Don't avoid shampooing to control itchy dandruff -- that's a myth that doesn't help. If you are African- American, you may do better not washing your hair daily; try a medicated shampoo weekly. If you have a pileup of itchy scales, the problem could be psoriasis. With this skin condition, new skin cells are made faster than usual. What helps: See a skin doctor for any scalp itching or burning that doesn't go away. For psoriasis, prescription medication, scale softeners, and shampoo can help. A doctor can also find and treat other skin conditions that annoy your scalp. These can range from serious problems like skin cancer to less serious ones like acne or lice."
78,"Does your heart sometimes beat very fast? Have you ever felt it skip a beat? This is called palpitations. It feels strange but is usually harmless. In some people, though, it could be a sign of a problem. Heart palpitations are one possible symptom of Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome. It is a rare condition of irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia. The heart has an electrical system that works a certain way. Signals travel in an exact pattern from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. This system keeps the heart beating regularly. People with Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome have an extra electrical pathway. It causes the abnormal heartbeats. And it could lead to a very serious arrhythmia called supraventricular tachycardia. This is when the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) beat very quickly. Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome is a congenital heart defect, something you're born with. Parents can pass it down to their children. But most times it happens randomly and doesn't run in families. If you have this condition, you also might have other heart problems. Even when you're born with the syndrome, you may not find out you have it until you're in your teens or older. Some people have symptoms and some do not. You may have the following: Dizziness or feeling light-headed Palpitations or feeling your heart flutter or beat harder Loss of consciousness Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Your doctor will recommend that you see a cardiologist or heart specialist. The specialist will ask you a lot of questions about past and current heart-related symptoms. He will give you a thorough physical exam that includes checking your heart rate and blood pressure. You may have diagnostic tests to check your heart. They might include: Electrocardiography to check the electrical activity of your heart. Holter monitoring to check your heart over a longer period of time. You'll wear a monitor that records your heart rhythm for 24 hours or more. Electrophysiological studies to locate and learn more about your arrhythmia. You may not need to take any medicine if you don't have symptoms. In that case, you might just need regular follow-up visits and tests. If you do have heart rhythm problems, your doctor may give you a prescription for medicine to control it. If medicines aren't enough, your doctor may recommend a procedure called catheter ablation. This is a procedure a doctor does to get rid of the areas of heart tissue that cause the irregular beats. If it doesn't work, or only helps a little, he can do it again, and there are also other treatments he can try. If you have only slight symptoms, or none, Wolff- Parkinson- White syndrome won't affect your life, except for the extra checkups. But some symptoms may pose challenges. For example, if you tend to faint because of the condition, you may not be able to drive a car or take part in other activities. How well you'll do depends a lot on the type of arrhythmia you have and how often it happens. That's why it's so important to see your doctor and get scheduled for tests."
79,"Heart failure and heart attack are both forms of heart disease. They have some common causes. But they also differ in key ways. Most heart attacks happen suddenly when one of the arteries leading to the heart becomes blocked and cuts off the blood flow. Without oxygen, the heart muscles start to die. Heart failure, on the other hand, usually develops gradually. The heart muscle becomes weaker and has trouble pumping blood to nourish the cells in your body. This is a chronic condition that gradually gets worse. But medications can help you live longer and better with it. Heart attacks can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart's pumping ability. Sometimes, heart failure comes on suddenly after a heart attack. Usually the symptoms are severe at first. This is called acute heart failure. But you can get better quickly with treatment and medication. Coronary artery disease is at the root of both heart attack and heart failure. This happens when a build-up over time of plaque from fat and other substances makes your arteries grow narrower or harder. Causes of heart attack Usually you have a heart attack after a piece of the plaque break offs. It then forms a blood clot, which stops the flow of blood. Sometimes, a spasm in a coronary artery can trigger a heart attack even if you don't have hardening of the arteries. Very rarely, a heart attack might happen because of a tear in walls of the coronary artery. This is called spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Causes of heart failure Over time, if your heart is pushing blood through a narrow, blocked space it becomes weaker. If it's not able to get enough blood supply, it can start to fail. Heart failure can also stem from other conditions. They include: Heart valve disease Congenital heart defects Infections Irregular heartbeat Problems with the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) HIV/ AIDS Chemotherapy Thyroid disease Alcohol overuse Lung disease Symptoms of a heart attack vary from person to person. They also can be different for men and women. But some signs of heart attacks are more common than others. They include: Pain or feeling of pressure in the center of the chest. It might feel like the area is being squeezed or like heartburn. The pain may last for several minutes or come and go. It can be mild or severe. Chest pain is the most common symptom. But some people don't have it at all. Pain and discomfort in your upper body, such as your neck, jaw, arms, back and stomach above your belly button. Trouble breathing. Nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, feeling very tired and breaking out in a cold sweat. This is more common in women, as is shortness of breath. If you have heart failure, you'll likely notice more than one of these classic symptoms: Shortness of breath (especially when lying down) Wheezing or coughing Fast or irregular heartbeat Tiredness Swelling around your ankles, legs, or stomach and weight gain from retaining fluid Confusion Heart attacks need to be treated right away. Call 911 even if you only suspect you're having one. Paramedics will probably give you blood-thinning aspirin to prevent any more clots and nitroglycerin to help blood flow. Your long-term treatment will depend on the cause, but many people recover well from a heart attack. You may need a procedure to open the blocked artery. With percutaneous coronary intervention, a surgeon threads a tube into the blocked artery. Then she expands a tiny balloon attached to the end of the tube to open the artery. At the same time, she may put a tiny mesh tube called a stent in to keep the artery propped open. Your doctor could suggest coronary artery bypass grafting. The surgeon takes out a healthy blood vessel and attaches it to the damaged vessel to create a detour for the blood. Your doctor will probably prescribe some long-term medications. They include drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. She may also suggest you learn how to manage your underlying heart disease through diet and exercise. Doctors prescribe many of the same drugs used for heart attacks for heart failure. This includes drugs to lower blood pressure or to slow your heart rate. Often, you'll take diuretic pills to get rid of extra water. That will ease swelling and shortness of breath. Lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, losing weight, cutting salt, and exercising also can help make things easier on your heart. As heart failure gets worse, you may need surgery to get a device that will help your heart. For instance, a pacemaker implanted in your heart can keep your heart pumping in rhythm. An implanted defibrillator can steady heartbeats. For very advanced heart failure, you may need a pump to keep your heart working. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be possible."
80,"Psychotic disorders are a group of serious illnesses that affect the mind. They make it hard for someone to think clearly, make good judgments, respond emotionally, communicate effectively, understand reality, and behave appropriately. When symptoms are severe, people with psychotic disorders have trouble staying in touch with reality and often are unable to handle daily life. But even severe psychotic disorders usually can be treated. There are different types of psychotic disorders, including: Schizophrenia: People with this illness have changes in behavior and other symptoms -- such as delusions and hallucinations -- that last longer than 6 months. It usually affects them at work or school, as well as their relationships. Schizoaffective disorder: People have symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder. Schizophreniform disorder: This includes symptoms of schizophrenia, but the symptoms last for a shorter time: between 1 and 6 months. Brief psychotic disorder: People with this illness have a sudden, short period of psychotic behavior, often in response to a very stressful event, such as a death in the family. Recovery is often quick -- usually less than a month. Delusional disorder : The key symptom is having a delusion (a false, fixed belief) involving a real-life situation that could be true but isn't, such as being followed, being plotted against, or having a disease. The delusion lasts for at least 1 month. Shared psychotic disorder (also called folie Ã deux): This illness happens when one person in a relationship has a delusion and the other person in the relationship adopts it, too. Substance-induced psychotic disorder: This condition is caused by the use of or withdrawal from drugs, such as hallucinogens and crack cocaine, that cause hallucinations, delusions, or confused speech. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition: Hallucinations, delusions, or other symptoms may happen because of another illness that affects brain function, such as a head injury or brain tumor. Paraphrenia: This condition has symptoms similar to schizophrenia. It starts late in life, when people are elderly. The main ones are hallucinations, delusions, and disordered forms of thinking. Hallucinations means seeing, hearing, or feeling things that don't exist. For instance, someone might see things that aren't there, hear voices, smell odors, have a ""funny"" taste in their mouth, or feel sensations on their skin even though nothing is touching their body. Delusions are false beliefs that don't go away after even after they've been shown to be false. For example, a person who is certain his or her food is poisoned, even if someone has shown them that the food is fine, has a delusion. Other possible symptoms of psychotic illnesses include: Disorganized or incoherent speech Confused thinking Strange, possibly dangerous behavior Slowed or unusual movements Loss of interest in personal hygiene Loss of interest in activities Problems at school or work and with relationships Cold, detached manner with the inability to express emotion Mood swings or other mood symptoms, such as depression or mania People don't always have the same symptoms, and they can change over time in the same person. Doctors don't know the exact cause of psychotic disorders. Researchers believe that many things play a role. Some psychotic disorders tend to run in families, which means that the disorder may be partly inherited. Other things may also influence their development, including stress, drug abuse, and major life changes. People with certain psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, may also have problems in parts of the brain that control thinking, perception, and motivation. In schizophrenia, experts believe that nerve cell receptors that work with a brain chemical called glutamate may not work properly in specific brain regions. That glitch may contribute to problems with thinking and perception. These conditions usually first appear when a person is in his or her late teens, 20s, or 30s. They tend to affect men and women about equally. To diagnose a psychotic disorder, doctors will take a medical and psychiatric history and possibly perform a brief physical exam. The person may get blood tests and sometimes brain imaging (such as MRI scans) to rule out physical illness or drug use like cocaine or LSD. If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, he or she may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals will use specially designed interview and assessment tools to decide whether the person has a psychotic disorder. Most psychotic disorders are treated with a combination of medications and psychotherapy, which is a type of counseling. Medication: The main type of drug that doctors prescribe to treat psychotic disorders are âantipsychotics.â Although these medicines aren't a cure, they are effective in managing the most troubling symptoms of psychotic disorders, such as delusions, hallucinations, and thinking problems. Older antipsychotics include: Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine) Fluphenazine ( Prolixin) Haloperidol ( Haldol) Loxapine ( Loxitane) Perphenazine ( Trilafon) Thioridazine ( Mellaril) Newer ""atypical antipsychotics"" include: Aripiprazole ( Abilify) Asenapine ( Saphris) Brexpiprazole ( Rexulti) Cariprazine ( Vraylar) Clozapine ( Clozaril) Iloperidone ( Fanapt) Lurasidone ( Latuda) Olanzapine ( Zyprexa) Paliperidone ( Invega) Paliperidone palmitate ( Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza) Quetiapine ( Seroquel) Risperidone ( Risperdal) Ziprasidone ( Geodon) Doctors usually first prescribe the newer ones because they have fewer and more tolerable side effects than older antipsychotics. Some of the medications are available by injection and only need to be taken once or twice a month. This can be easier to manage than remembering to take a daily pill. Psychotherapy: There are different types of counseling -- including individual, group, and family therapy â that can help someone who has a psychotic disorder. Most people with psychotic disorders are treated as outpatients, meaning they don't live in institutions. But sometimes people need to be hospitalized, such as if they have severe symptoms, are in danger of hurting themselves or others, or can't care for themselves because of their illness. Each person being treated for a psychotic disorder may respond to therapy differently. Some will show improvement quickly. For others, it may take weeks or months to get symptom relief. Some people may need to continue treatment for an extended period of time. Some, such as those who have had several severe episodes, may need to take medication indefinitely. In these cases, the medication usually is given in as low a dose as possible to minimize side effects. The depends on the type of psychotic disorder and the person who has it. But these disorders are treatable, and most people will have a good recovery with treatment and close follow-up care. No. But the sooner treatment starts, the better. It helps to prevent symptoms. Seeking help as soon as possible can help the person's life, family, and relationships. For people who are at high risk for psychotic disorders, such as those who have a family history of schizophrenia, avoiding drugs such as marijuana and alcohol may help to prevent or delay these conditions."
81,"Your eyes are burning, itchy, and tired. It's a common condition but rarely serious. You can take simple steps to prevent or ease this problem. It those tactics don't work, see your doctor. What you're feeling could be a sign of a deeper condition that requires treatment. This is especially important if you have headaches or other problems like: Eye discomfort Double vision A big change in vision Anything that requires intense eye use can cause fatigue. Some of the most common are: Reading Writing Driving If you look at bright light or spend time in a place that's too dim, it can also tire your peepers. Your eyes might get tired easily if you stare for long periods at a computer, smartphone, or game console. The eye doctor might call this computer vision syndrome or digital eye strain. It affects most people who use one. Some estimates say computer-related eye symptoms may be responsible for up to 10 million eye doctor visits a year. The problem is expected to grow as more people use smartphones and other handheld digital devices, which force your eyes to work harder than usual as they strain to focus on tiny words. Digital devices may also be linked to eye fatigue because you tend to blink less often when looking at a computer screen. People usually blink about 18 times a minute. This naturally refreshes the eyes. But studies suggest that people only blink about half as often while looking at a computer or other digital device. This can result in dry, tired, itchy, and burning eyes. Be on the lookout for: Sore or irritated eyes Trouble focusing Dry or watery eyes Blurred or double vision Increased sensitivity to light Pain in the neck, shoulders, or back These symptoms can lower your productivity. If you stay awake long hours working, you can make the problem worse. Sleep refreshes your eye with essential nutrients. Lack of sleep may lead to repeated eye irritation. Make some simple changes to: Your computer screen: Place it 20-26 inches away from your eyes and a little below eye level. Regularly clean off dust and fingerprints from the surface. Smudges can reduce contrast and create problems like glare and reflections. Choose screens that tilt and swivel. Use a glare filter for your screen. Your work environment: Change lighting to get rid of glare and harsh reflections. Use an adjustable chair. Place a document holder next to your computer screen. Your work habits: Try the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Post a note that says "" Blink"" on your computer as a reminder. Take regular breaks from computer work. Your eye-care routine: Apply a washcloth soaked in warm water to tired, dry eyes (keep your eyes closed). Use artificial tears to refresh your eyes when they feel dry. To help prevent dry eyes while indoors, use an air cleaner to filter dust and a humidifier to add moisture to the air. If you have eye fatigue or pain, see an eye doctor to make sure a deeper medical condition isn't to blame. If the problem doesn't go away, make an appointment for a full eye exam. The doctor can make sure your symptoms aren't linked to a problem like an eye muscle imbalance or dry eye. He can also tell if your glasses or contact lens prescription is up to date and good for computer use."
82,"Stress can hamper your diabetes care. For instance, if you have so much on your mind that you skip meals or forget to take your medicines, that will affect your blood sugar level. Life will always have challenges and setbacks, but you have the power to choose how you respond to it. Use these six tips as a start. 1. Keep a positive attitude. When things seem to be going wrong, it's easier to see the bad instead of the good. Find something to appreciate in each important area of your life, such as your family, friends, work, and health. That perspective can help you get through tough times. 2. Be kind to yourself. Do you expect too much from yourself? It's OK to say ""no"" to things that you don't really want or need to do. 3. Accept what you can't change. Ask yourself these three questions: "" Will this be important 2 years from now?"" "" Do I have control over these circumstances?"" "" Can I change my situation?"" If you can make things better, go for it. If not, is there a different way to handle it that would be better for you? 4. Talk to someone. You could confide in a trusted family member or close friend. There are also professionals who can listen and help you find solutions. Ask your doctor for recommendations if you'd like to see a psychologist or counselor. 5. Tap the power of exercise. You can blow off steam with hard exercise, recharge on a hike, or do a relaxing mind-body activity like yoga or tai chi. You'll feel better. 6. Take time to unwind. Practice muscle relaxation, deep breathing, meditation, or visualization. Your doctor may know of classes or programs that teach these skills. You can also check for apps that do that."
83,"If you're trying to fight off the itchy patches that come with psoriasis, you're probably no stranger to creams, gels, and ointments. There are lots out there, but one of the strongest weapons in your arsenal is something called a topical corticosteroid. It can control the inflammation that makes your skin look puffy and red. "" Topical"" is just a fancy word for something you put on your skin. You can't buy a corticosteroid like that without a prescription from your doctor. The two of you will work together to find the strength and dose that works best for you. Corticosteroids come in a wide variety of strengths. They're ranked on a scale of 1 through 7. If it's labeled ""1"" it means the drug is ""super potent"" or very strong. When it has a ""7"" it's got a rating of ""least potent"" or very weak. Your doctor will weigh several different things before he suggests a specific corticosteroid for you. He'll consider your age, how severe your disease is, and the part of your body that's got an outbreak. He'll also go over with you the potential side effects from the treatment. Weaker corticosteroids are best if you need to use it on sensitive areas such as your face, groin, or breasts. Your doctor may also prescribe a lower-strength version if you have to use it for a long time. Mild to mid-strength ones can be used for children. You may need a stronger one if you have a severe form of psoriasis. It's also a good choice for spots with thicker skin, such as your palms or the soles of your feet. Whether you get them depends a lot on the strength of the corticosteroid, how large an area you spread it on, and how long you use it. To lower your risk, your doctor may look for the weakest one that can get the job done in the shortest time. Some common side effects that could happen to you: Thinning of your skin Changes in skin coloring You bruise easily Stretch marks Skin gets reddish Broken blood vessels Increased hair growth in localized areas Infections You become sensitive to light Corticosteroids can be absorbed through your skin and sometimes cause health problems such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and a hormonal problem called Cushing's syndrome. A few simple tips can help you get the best results -- and keep you safe, too: Follow instructions. Don't wing it. Your doctor will tell you how often to apply the medicine. Don't overdo it. When you put it on your skin, use a small amount and only on the area that needs treatment. Skin only. Never use a topical corticosteroid on your eyes unless your doctor tells you to. It can cause glaucoma or cataracts. Keep an eye on the calendar. Use this treatment only for as long as your doctor says you should. Don't stop suddenly. If you do it can cause your psoriasis to flare up. To keep that from happening, your doctor will slowly decrease the amount you use."

You'll need to see your doctor to find out if you have it. Your doctor will give you a complete physical exam. You may get a throat culture to rule out strep throat, which has symptoms that are similar to mono. Your doctor may also take a sample of blood to check for abnormal white blood cells. You may also get a heterophile antibody test. It checks your blood for special antibodies that your body makes to fight off a viral infection. But it's not specific to mono. This test isn't always accurate, especially in younger children, and it takes several days for it to show the presence of the antibodies after a child starts to feel ill. The âmonospotâ is one test that checks for heterophile antibodies. The results of these tests are not always clear, so you may need even more tests. You may also get an EBV test if you don't seem to have a typical case of mono. This blood test checks for Epstein Barr virus. Doctors usually don't need EBV test results to diagnose mono. But it can help them find out if the Epstein Barr virus is to blame. It's a common virus, and although it can cause mono, you could have the virus and not be sick. Most people start to recover from mononucleosis within 2 weeks, though some symptoms, such as fatigue, can take 3-4 weeks or even longer to go away. So a common treatment plan for mono is rest with a gradual return to normal activity. The goal is to ease your symptoms and treat any complications that happen. In addition to rest, your doctor may prescribe ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the fever, sore throat, and other discomforts of the illness. In case mono has affected your liver, check with your doctor before you take acetaminophen. Don't give aspirin to children or teens. It's been linked to a disease called Reye's syndrome, a serious illness that can be life-threatening. Call 911 if you or your child is having any trouble breathing. If your sore throat is so severe that you have trouble breathing or eating, your doctor may give you prednisone, a steroid. Since your spleen, which is an organ in your abdomen, often becomes enlarged when you have mono, it's more likely to rupture. So you will need to avoid contact sports such as football and soccer, probably for about 3-4 weeks. Your doctor can let you know when it's OK to get back to those activities."
85,"Hand pain can happen for many reasons, from accidents to conditions that are ongoing. It can often be treated so that your symptoms ease up. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } This article looks at some of the most common causes of hand pain. This is also called de Quervain's tendinosis. It causes pain on the thumb side of the wrist. The pain may develop gradually or start suddenly. It can travel the length of the thumb and up the forearm. If you have de Quervain's tendinitis, it can be painful to: Make a fist Grasp or hold objects Turn your wrist The pain results from irritation or inflammation of the wrist tendons at the base of the thumb. Repetitive activities and overuse are often responsible for de Quervain's. New mothers can get it from holding their baby in an awkward position. Wrist fractures can also make you more likely to get de Quervain's. Pain relief treatments include: A splint to rest the thumb and wrist Anti-inflammatory medications Cortisone shots Surgery may be an option if symptoms remain severe after you have tried other treatments. This is one of the most common nerve disorders of the hand. It causes pain in the: Palm and some fingers of the hand Wrist Forearm Often the pain is worse at night than during the day. Carpal tunnel syndrome can also cause: Weakness Tingling Numbness You may especially feel it in your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. This can make it hard to grip objects. The discomfort happens when swelling constricts the median nerve. The median nerve controls sensation and muscle impulses in the thumb and most of the fingers (except for the pinkie finger and the half of the ring finger that's closest to the pinkie finger). The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is a structure made up of bones and connective tissues that is located at the base of the hand. It is in this narrow space that the median nerve is pinched by inflamed or irritated tendons or other swelling. Common treatments include: Resting the hand and wrist Anti-inflammatory or analgesic painkillers Wrist splints Steroid shots Physical therapy Your doctor may suggest surgery if your symptoms last for 6 months or more. A fracture, or a break in a bone, can cause a great deal of hand pain. Besides pain, after a fracture you may have: Stiffness Swelling Loss of movement If you have fractured a finger, for example, you may not be able to move it fully. Your injured finger could be swollen and in some cases slightly shorter than usual. There are several types of fractures: Simple (broken bone is aligned and stable) Complex (break may cause bone to shift or become displaced, making treatment more difficult) Comminuted (bones broken in more than one place) Compound (broken bone breaks through skin) Fracture treatment depends on the type of the break. Casts or splints are often used for simple breaks. You may need pins, wires, or plates to treat more complicated fractures. Surgery might also be needed to set the broken bone completely. This is a leading source of hand pain. It causes joints to lose the cartilage that allows them to move smoothly against each other. As the cartilage deteriorates, painful, sometimes debilitating, swelling begins to occur. In the hand, the areas where this most often occurs are the: Base of the thumb Middle joint of one or more fingers End joint, which is closest to the finger tip Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It causes progressive degeneration of cartilage. It can happen with aging or following an injury, such as a fracture or dislocation. When it affects the hand, it causes: Pain Swelling Stiffness Bony nodules may also form at the middle or end joints of the fingers. Osteoarthritis can also cause deep, aching pain at the base of the thumb. The hand may also become weaker, making everyday activities difficult. Treatment depends on the severity of the pain and disability. Treatment includes: Anti-inflammatory or analgesic painkillers Splints for the fingers or wrist Heat Physical therapy If these treatments do not provide relief, surgery may be recommended. Doctors call this stenosing tenosynovitis. It causes fingers or the thumb to lock in a bent position. It can be painful, especially when you bend or straighten the affected finger or thumb. The condition develops when the flexor tendons, which control the movements of the fingers and thumb, become irritated. This can make them thicken within the tendon sheath that surrounds the flexor tendons. Nodules may also form on the affected tendons. The sheath itself may thicken, too. All of this prevents the smooth movement of the tendons. Eventually, the tendon may become stuck when you try to straighten a bent finger or thumb. You may also feel a catching sensation when the finger or thumb locks in place, and then a pop as the tendon is released. Doctors don't know what causes trigger finger. You're more likely to get it if you have: Rheumatoid arthritis Gout Diabetes Women get the condition more often than men do. And trigger finger is more common in adults between ages 40 and 60. Rest, sometimes while wearing a splint, may fix the problem. Over-the-counter pain medications can ease the pain. Corticosteroid injections (steroid shots) often can help relieve symptoms. Your doctor may recommend surgery if other treatments fail."
86,"When you get a thyroid biopsy, your doctor will take a little bit of your thyroid or lumps (known as nodules) growing on it to test in a lab. Nodules are very common in the thyroid, which is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck. Although they can cause different problems, they're usually not cancer. Some conditions can make your thyroid grow in size. Doctors call this a âgoiter.â You may need treatment for it, but more often than not, it's not cancer either. Before you get a thyroid biopsy, you'll probably get blood tests to see how your thyroid is working and imaging tests, too. If they raise any concerns, your doctor will recommend a biopsy. Sometimes, a nodule or goiter just sits there and isn't dangerous. When they do cause problems, it could be something like: Cysts, fluid-filled nodules that can give you neck pain or make it hard to swallow. They're very rarely cancer but still might need treatment. Graves' disease, which causes your thyroid to grow and make too many hormones. Hashimoto's disease, where your thyroid is damaged by your immune system, so it makes fewer hormones than normal and then swells. Infection, where a virus causes pain and swelling in your thyroid. Large nodules or goiters that are an issue because of their size. They can push into surrounding body parts and make it harder to breathe or swallow. Toxic nodules or goiters, which are almost never cancer, can cause your thyroid to pump out too many hormones. Cancer, which makes up about 10% of cases. A biopsy helps your doctor find the cause of a nodule or goiter. But you don't need it for all thyroid problems. For example, your symptoms, blood tests, and imaging will be enough to tell if you have Graves' disease. Your doctor will likely want to check on any nodule bigger than about 1 centimeter (about half an inch), especially if imaging shows that the nodule is solid, has calcium on it, and doesn't have clear borders around it. You might also get a biopsy without a nodule if you're in a lot of pain and your thyroid is growing quickly. You'll almost always get fine needle aspiration biopsy, but there may be reasons to get other ones, as well. Fine needle aspiration ( FNA) biopsy. This test uses a small needle. You'll be awake, and the most you'll feel is a small pinch. So you probably won't need any numbing medicines. With the help of ultrasound imaging, your doctor places the needle into your neck to pull out a sample for testing. You may feel the needle move around a little. And your doctor might repeat it a few times to get at different parts of the nodule or goiter. Your doctor might take samples from lymph nodes near your thyroid as well. The procedure takes about half an hour. You may get a small bandage where the needle went in. Then, you can go on with the rest of your day. Core needle biopsy. This is like FNA, but with a bigger needle. If your doctor doesn't get clear answers from an FNA biopsy, this one might be a good backup plan. Researchers are still looking at when and how to best use it. Surgical biopsy. Doctors rarely use this method on the thyroid. It requires making an opening in your neck to remove the node. It may even mean removing half your thyroid. Because it's surgery, you'll get medicines to put you under during the operation. It also means a longer recovery. You can get your results in as fast as a few days, though it could take up to 2 weeks. Ask your doctor when you should find out. What happens next depends on what the biopsy showed. If it's not cancer and you don't have other symptoms, you and your doctor may do âwatchful waiting.â That means follow-up visits on a schedule to check on things, like a change to a nodule or a new one showing up. If it's cancer, you'll likely need surgery. Most thyroid cancers can be treated. In other cases, you may need treatment for an underactive or overactive thyroid. Or for large nodules that get in the way of breathing or swallowing. Sometimes, an FNA doesn't give a sure answer. Often, the first step is to repeat it. If the results still aren't clear, you and your doctor will talk about your options based on your symptoms and other test results. It could mean that you get another type of biopsy, thyroid surgery, or watchful waiting."
87,"Diets based on the glycemic index -- Sugar Busters, the Zone Diet, and Nutrisystem - are more famous than the original â G. I. Diet.â The glycemic index was designed to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. And what works to control blood sugar, the theory goes, should help you drop extra weight. Like its better-known children, the glycemic index diet focuses on carbs. It gets a little complicated, but here's the basic idea: Some foods -- like white bread, cookies, and white potatoes -- make your blood sugar rise quickly. On the glycemic index diet, you eat carbs that produce a steadier rise in blood sugar; and the fiber in those foods helps you feel full longer. You're not as hungry, and you feel more satisfied. Sticking to a low glycemic index diet may help prevent conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it's not certain that this diet can help you lose weight any better or faster than a low-fat, low-carb, generally healthy diet. One study showed that people on a low-glycemic diet lost more fat than those on a high-glycemic diet with the same calories. Overall, the scientific evidence is mixed and unable to show consistent findings. Foods on the glycemic index diet are scored on a scale of 0 to 100 based on how much they raise your blood sugar level. High- GI foods (70 or higher): white rice, white bread, pretzels, white bagels, white baked potatoes, crackers, sugar-sweetened beverages Medium- GI foods (56-69): grapes, spaghetti, ice cream, raisins, corn on the cob Low- GI foods (55 and under): oatmeal, peanuts, peas, carrots, kidney beans, hummus, skim milk, most fruits (except those listed above and watermelon) On the diet, you try to eat more foods in the low- GI category, and fewer in the high- GI group. You don't have to do any calorie counting or portion control, and you can eat a pretty varied diet. You also don't need to cut out almost all carbs. You do need to be selective about your carbs, checking the glycemic index value of the foods you eat. Limitations: The glycemic index diet can be confusing. Just because a food is low on the index doesn't mean it's healthy. And some high glycemic index foods offer a lot of nutrition. For example, parsnips have a higher glycemic index value (52) than vanilla cake (42). Also, the diet doesn't offer advice on non-carb foods. It's up to you to figure out how many calories and how much fat you're getting each day. And eating some foods in combination -- like a high glycemic index carb with protein and fat, for example -- can affect how much your blood sugar rises. Cooking and shopping: You can shop and cook like you normally would, but you need to use ingredients that are low on the glycemic index. Packaged foods or meals: None are required, but certain programs -- like Nutrisystem -- that follow the glycemic index diet do include packaged meals. In-person meetings: No. Exercise: Exercise is not part of this diet. Yes. People who are on vegetarian, gluten-free, and other diets that are restrictive can follow this plan. You can choose foods you like, but you may need to make substitutions. Your diet needs to be healthy, and that involves more than the glycemic index. Be wary of diets that recommend extreme approaches, like eating a lot of meat or other foods that are high in saturated fat. Cost: How much you spend depends on where you shop for groceries and the foods you buy. If you join a plan, you will have to pay the cost of packaged food. Support: Usually you'll do this program on your own. You can get food and menu ideas in books like The Glucose Revolution or Sugar Busters! Does It Work? The glycemic index diet is really not a weight loss diet. For people with diabetes who count carbs to manage their blood sugar, this diet will help you choose carbs wisely. Keep in mind that the glycemic index diet doesn't cover everything you eat or should eat for a healthy diet. Some higher-glycemic foods are still healthy for you, like sweet potatoes. And some lower-glycemic foods can pack a lot of calories if you eat too many, like nuts. So while the glycemic index may guide your choice of carbs, you'll have to decide how much of them to eat. And you'll have to monitor how much protein and fat you're getting, as well. There are other diet plans that remove the guesswork by putting all this information together, so those might work better for you. If you are at risk for diabetes, then incorporating the glycemic index may help you keep your blood sugars in check. Is It Good for Certain Conditions? It can help if you have diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends traditional carb counting for blood sugar control with the glycemic index information to help âfine tuneâ meal planning. This diet may also help if you are insulin-resistant or have prediabetes. If you have a combination of high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol, and are overweight, that may include you. Research suggests that people with insulin resistance lose weight more easily on a low-carb diet. The added benefit of better blood sugar control is you lower your odds of getting complications from diabetes, including heart, eye, and kidney disease. The Final Word The glycemic index diet was developed to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar, and that's what it's best for. For those with diabetes or prediabetes, this diet is an important piece in the big picture of taking charge of the food you eat and staying healthy and active."
88,"Acesulfame-k: An artificial sweetener used in place of sugar; it contains no carbohydrates or sugar; therefore, it has no effect on blood sugar levels. This sweetener is often used in conjunction with other artificial sweeteners in processed low-calorie foods. It is also used as a tabletop sweetener under the brand names Sunette, Sweet One, and Swiss Sweet. Acetone: A chemical formed in the blood when the body breaks down fat instead of sugar for energy; if acetone forms, it usually means the cells are starved. Commonly, the body's production of acetone is known as ""ketosis."" It occurs when there is an absolute or relative deficiency in insulin so sugars cannot get into cells for energy. The body then tries to use other energy sources like proteins from muscle and fat from fat cells. Acetone passes through the body into the urine. Acidosis: Too much acid in the body, usually from the production of ketones like acetone, when cells are starved; for a person with diabetes, the most common type of acidosis is called ""ketoacidosis."" Acute: Abrupt onset that is usually severe; happens for a limited period of time. Adrenal glands: Two endocrine glands that sit on top of the kidneys and make and release stress hormones, such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which stimulates carbohydrate metabolism; norepinephrine, which raises heart rate and blood pressure; and corticosteroid hormones, which control how the body utilizes fat, protein, carbohydrates, and minerals, and helps reduce inflammation. They also produce sex hormones like testosterone and can produce DHEA and progesterone. Adult-onset diabetes: A term for type 2 diabetes that is no longer used, because this type of diabetes is now commonly seen in children; ""non-insulin dependent diabetes"" is also considered an incorrect phrase in describing type 2 diabetes, because patients with this type of diabetes may at some point require insulin. Advantame: An FDA-approved sugar substitute similar to Aspartame; it can be used as both a tabletop sweetener and as an ingredient in cooking. Advantame can also be used in baked goods, soft drinks and other non-alcoholic beverages, chewing gum, candies, frostings, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings, jams and jellies, processed fruits and fruit juices, toppings and syrups. Adverse effect: Harmful effect. Albuminuria: When kidneys become damaged, they start to leak protein in the urine. Albumin is a small, abundant protein in the blood that passes through the kidney filter into the urine easier than other proteins. Albuminuria occurs in about 30%-45% of people who have had type 1 diabetes for at least 10 years. In people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the kidneys may already show signs of small amounts of protein spillage, called ""microalbuminuria."" This may be from the result of diabetes or from other diseases seen in conjunction with diabetes, like high blood pressure. Protein in the urine increases the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease. It also means that the person is at a particularly high risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. Alpha cell: A type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans; alpha cells make and release a hormone called ""glucagon."" Glucagon functions in direct opposition to insulin -- it increases the amount of glucose in the blood by releasing stored sugar from the liver. Anomaly: Birth defects; deviation from the norm or average. Antibodies: Proteins that the body produces to protect itself from foreign substances, such as bacteria or viruses. Antidiabetic agent: A substance that helps people with diabetes control the level of sugar in their blood (see insulin, oral diabetes medication). Antigens: Substances that cause an immune response in the body, identifying substances or markers on cells; the body produces antibodies to fight antigens, or harmful substances, and tries to eliminate them. Artery: A blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to other parts of the body; arteries are thicker than veins and have stronger, more elastic walls. Arteries sometimes develop plaque within their walls in a process known as ""atherosclerosis."" These plaques can become fragile and rupture, leading to complications associated with diabetes, such as heart attacks and strokes. Artificial pancreas: A glucose sensor attached to an insulin delivery device; both are connected together by what is known as a ""closed loop system."" In other words, it is a system that not only can determine the body glucose level, but also takes that information and releases the appropriate amounts of insulin for the particular sugar it just measured. The artificial pancreas can regulate the amount of insulin released, so low sugars would cause the device to decrease insulin delivery. Trials using an artificial pancreas are currently under way, and the hope is that this system will be commercially available within 5 years. Studies are also being conducted to develop a version of this system that can be implanted. Aspartame: An artificial sweetener used in place of sugar, because it has few calories; sold as '' Equal"" and "" Nutra Sweet."" Asymptomatic: No symptoms; no clear sign that disease is present. Atherosclerosis: A disease of the arteries caused by deposits of cholesterol in the walls of arteries; these plaques can build up and cause narrowing of the arteries or they can become fragile and break off, forming blood clots that cause heart attacks and stroke. The arteries that supply blood to the heart can become severely narrowed, decreasing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart, especially during times of increased activity. Autoantibody test: This blood test, called the zinc transporter 8 autoantibody ( Zn T8 Ab) test, is used along with other information and test results to determine if a person has type 1 diabetes and not another type of diabetes. Autoimmune disease: A disorder of the body's immune system in which the immune system mistakenly attacks itself; examples of these diseases include type 1 diabetes, hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease, and hypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto's disease. Autonomic neuropathy: Nerve damage to the part of the nervous system that we cannot consciously control; these nerves control our digestive system, blood vessels, urinary system, skin, and sex organs. Autonomic nerves are not under a person's control and function on their own. Background retinopathy: This is the mildest form of eye disease caused by diabetes; it can be associated with normal vision. With a longer duration of diabetes or with uncontrolled blood sugars, eye damage can progress to more serious forms. Basal rate: The amount of insulin required to manage normal daily blood glucose fluctuations; most people constantly produce insulin to manage the glucose fluctuations that occur during the day. In a person with diabetes, giving a constant low level amount of insulin via insulin pump mimics this normal phenomenon. Beta cell: A type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans; beta cells make and release insulin, which helps control the glucose level in the blood. Biosynthetic insulin: Genetically engineered human insulin; this insulin has a much lower risk of inducing an allergic reaction in people who use it, unlike cow (bovine) or pork (porcine) insulins. The manufacturers of synthetic insulin make it in a short-acting form, which works to cover mealtime increases in sugars; they also produce longer-acting insulins, which cover sugars between meals and when fasting, such as during the night. Blood glucose: See glucose. Blood glucose monitoring or testing: A method of testing how much sugar is in your blood; home blood-glucose monitoring involves pricking your finger with a lancing device, putting a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting the test strip into a blood-glucose-testing meter that displays your blood glucose level. Blood-sugar testing can also be done in the laboratory. Blood-glucose monitoring is recommended three or four times a day for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Depending on the situation, glucose checks before meals, two hours after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of the night, and before and after exercise, may be recommended. Blood pressure: The measurement of the pressure or force of blood against the blood vessels (arteries); blood pressure is written as two numbers. The first number or top number is called the systolic pressure and is the measure of pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and pushes more blood into the arteries. The second number, called the diastolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. The ideal blood pressure for non-pregnant people with diabetes is 130/80 or less. Brittle diabetes: When a person's blood sugar level often shifts very quickly from high to low and from low to high. Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN): A product of metabolism that is excreted in the urine; it is measured in the blood as an indirect measure of how well the kidney is functioning. Increased BUN levels in the blood may indicate early kidney damage, meaning the kidneys aren't effectively excreting BUN. Bunion: Bump or bulge on the first joint of the big toe caused by the swelling of a sac of fluid under the skin and abnormalities in the joint; women are usually affected because of tight fitting or pointed shoes or high heels that put pressure on the toes, forcing the outward movement of the joint. People with flat feet or low arches are also prone to bunions. Shoes that fit well and are padded can prevent bunions from forming. Bunions may lead to other problems, such as serious infection from the big toe putting pressure on other toes. Callus: A small area of skin, usually on the foot, that has become thick and hard from rubbing or pressure; calluses may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. Shoes that fit well can prevent calluses from forming. Calorie: Energy that comes from food; some foods have more calories than others. Fats have more calories than proteins and carbohydrate. Most vegetables have few. Carbohydrate: One of the three main classes of foods and a source of energy; carbohydrates are mainly sugars and starches that the body breaks down into glucose (a simple sugar that the body can use to feed its cells). Cardiologist: A doctor who takes care of people with heart disease; a heart specialist. Cardiovascular: Relating to the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). Certified Diabetes Educator ( CDE): A health care professional who is certified by the American Association of Diabetes Educators ( AADE) to teach people with diabetes how to manage their condition. Cholesterol: A waxy, odorless substance made by the liver that is an essential part of cell walls and nerves; cholesterol plays an important role in body functions such as digestion and hormone production. In addition to being produced by the body, cholesterol comes from animal foods that we eat. Too much cholesterol in the blood causes an increase in particles called LDL (''bad'' cholesterol), which increases the buildup of plaque in the artery walls and leads to atherosclerosis. Claudication: See intermittent claudication. Coma: An emergency in which a person is not conscious; may occur in people with diabetes because their blood sugar is too high or too low. Dawn phenomenon: A rise in blood sugar levels in the early morning hours. Dehydration: Large loss of body water; if a person with diabetes has a very high blood sugar level, it causes increased water loss through increased urination and therefore, extreme thirst. Diabetes: See type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA): A severe, life-threatening condition that results from hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), dehydration, and acid buildup that needs emergency fluid and insulin treatment; DKA happens when there is not enough insulin and cells become starved for sugars. An alternative source of energy called ketones becomes activated. The system creates a buildup of acids. Ketoacidosis can lead to coma and even death. Dietitian: An expert in nutrition who helps people plan the type and amount of foods to eat for special health needs; a registered dietitian ( RD) has special qualifications. Emergency medical identification: Cards, bracelets, or necklaces with a written message, used by people with diabetes or other medical problems to alert others in case of a medical emergency, such as coma. Endocrinologist: A doctor who treats people with hormone problems. Exchange lists: A way of grouping foods together to help people on special diets stay on the diet; each group lists food in a serving size. A person can exchange, trade, or substitute a food serving in one group for another food serving in the same group. The lists put foods into six groups: starch/bread, meat, vegetables, fruit, milk, and fats. Within a food group, one serving of each food item in that group has about the same amount of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and calories. Fasting plasma glucose test ( FPG): The preferred method of screening for diabetes; the FPG measures a person's blood sugar level after fasting or not eating anything for at least 8 hours. Normal fasting blood glucose is less than 100 milligrams per deciliter or mg/d L. A fasting plasma glucose greater than 100 mg/d L and less than126 mg/d L implies that the person has an impaired fasting glucose level but may not have diabetes. A diagnosis of diabetes is made when the fasting blood glucose is greater than 126 mg/d L and when blood tests confirm abnormal results. These tests can be repeated on a subsequent day or by measuring glucose 2 hours after a meal. The results should show an elevated blood glucose of more than 200 mg/d L. Fats: Substances that help the body use some vitamins and keep the skin healthy; they are also the main way the body stores energy. In food, there are many types of fats -- saturated, unsaturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and trans fats. To maintain your blood cholesterol and triglyceride (lipid) levels as near the normal ranges as possible, the American Diabetes Association recommends limiting the amount of saturated fats and cholesterol in our diets. Saturated fats contribute to blood levels of LDL (''bad'') cholesterol. The amount of saturated fats should be limited to less than 10% of total caloric intake, and the amount of dietary cholesterol should be limited to 300 mg/day. Fructose: A type of sugar found in many fruits and vegetables and in honey; fructose is used to sweeten some diet foods, but this type of sweetener is typically not recommended for people with diabetes, because it could have a negative effect on blood sugar. Gangrene: The death of body tissues, usually due to a lack of blood supply, especially in the legs and feet. Gastroparesis: A form of nerve damage that affects the stomach and intestines; with this condition, food is not digested properly and does not move through the stomach and intestinal tract normally. It can result in nausea and vomiting, because the transit time of food is slowed by nerve damage. This type of nerve damage can also cause a significant problem with low and erratic blood sugars. Gestational diabetes: A high blood sugar level that starts or is first recognized during pregnancy; hormone changes during pregnancy affect the action of insulin, resulting in high blood sugar levels. Usually, blood sugar levels return to normal after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Gestational diabetes can increase complications during labor and delivery and increase the rates of fetal complications related to the increased size of the baby. Glaucoma: An eye disease associated with increased pressure within the eye; glaucoma can damage the optic nerve and cause impaired vision and blindness. Glucagon: A hormone that raises the level of glucose in the blood by releasing stored glucose from the liver; glucagon is sometimes injected when a person has lost consciousness (passed out) from low blood sugar levels. The injected glucagon helps raise the level of glucose in the blood. Glucose: A simple sugar found in the blood; it is the body's main source of energy; also known as ""dextrose."" Glucose tolerance test: A test to determine if a person has diabetes; the test is done in a lab or doctor's office in the morning before the person has eaten. A period of at least 8 hours without any food is recommended prior to doing the test. First, a sample of blood is taken in the fasting state. Then the person drinks a liquid that has sugar in it. Two hours later, a second blood test is done. A fasting blood sugar equal to or greater than 126 mg/dl is considered diabetes. A fasting blood sugar between 100 mg/dl and 125 mg/dl is classified as impaired fasting glucose. If the two-hour test result shows a blood sugar equal to or greater than 200 mg/dl, the person is considered to have diabetes. A two-hour blood glucose between 140 mg/dl and 199 mg/dl is classified as impaired glucose tolerance. Glycated hemoglobin test ( Hb A1c): This is an important blood test to determine how well you are managing your diabetes; hemoglobin is a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues. It can also attach to sugar in the blood, forming a substance called glycated hemoglobin or a Hemoglobin A1 C. The test provides an average blood sugar measurement over a 6- to 12-week period and is used in conjunction with home glucose monitoring to make treatment adjustments. The ideal range for people with diabetes is generally less than 7%. This test can also be used to diagnose diabetes when the Hb A1c level is equal to or greater than 6.5%. High blood pressure: A condition when the blood flows through the blood vessels at a force greater than normal; high blood pressure strains the heart, harms the arteries, and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems; also called ""hypertension."" The goal for blood pressure in people with diabetes is less than 130/80. High blood sugar: See hyperglycemia. Home blood glucose monitoring: A way in which a person can test how much sugar is in the blood; also called ""self-monitoring of blood glucose."" Home glucose monitoring tests whole blood (plasma and blood cell components); thus, the results can be different from lab values, which test plasma values of glucose. Typically, the lab plasma values can be higher than the glucose checks done at home with a glucose monitor. Hormone: A chemical released in one organ or part of the body that travels through the blood to another area, where it helps to control certain bodily functions; for instance, insulin is a hormone made by the beta cells in the pancreas and when released, it triggers other cells to use glucose for energy. Human insulin: Bio-engineered insulin very similar to insulin made by the body; the DNA code for making human insulin is put into bacteria or yeast cells and the insulin made is purified and sold as human insulin. Hyperglycemia: High blood sugar; this condition is fairly common in people with diabetes. Many things can cause hyperglycemia. It occurs when the body does not have enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it does have. Hypertension: See high blood pressure. Hypoglycemia: Low blood sugar; the condition often occurs in people with diabetes. Most cases occur when there is too much insulin and not enough glucose in your body. Impotence: Also called ""erectile dysfunction;"" persistent inability of the penis to become erect or stay erect. Some men may become impotent after having diabetes for a long time, because nerves and blood vessels in the penis become damaged. It is estimated that 50% of men diagnosed with type 2 diabetes experiences impotence. Injection site rotation: Changing the areas on the body where a person injects insulin; by changing the area of injection, the injections will be easier, safer, and more comfortable. If the same injection site is used over and over again, hardened areas, lumps, or indentations can develop under the skin, which keep the insulin from being used properly. These lumps or indentations are called ""lipodystrophies."" Injection sites: Places on the body where people can inject insulin most easily. Insulin: A hormone produced by the pancreas that helps the body use sugar for energy; the beta cells of the pancreas make insulin. Insulin-dependent diabetes: Former term used for type 1 diabetes. Insulin mixture: A mixture of insulin that contains short-, intermediate- or long-acting insulin; you can buy premixed insulin to eliminate the need for mixing insulin from two bottles. Insulin pump: A small, computerized device -- about the size of a small cell phone -- that is worn on a belt or put in a pocket; insulin pumps have a small flexible tube with a fine needle on the end. The needle is inserted under the skin of the abdomen and taped in place. A carefully measured, steady flow of insulin is released into the body. Insulin reaction: Another term for hypoglycemia in a person with diabetes; this occurs when a person with diabetes has injected too much insulin, eaten too little food, or has exercised without eating extra food. Insulin receptors: Areas on the outer part of a cell that allow insulin in the blood to join or bind with the cell; when the cell and insulin bind together, the cell can take glucose from the blood and use it for energy. Insulin resistance: When the effect of insulin on muscle, fat, and liver cells becomes less effective; this effect occurs with both insulin produced in the body and with insulin injections. Therefore, higher levels of insulin are needed to lower the blood sugar. Insulin resistance syndrome or metabolic syndrome: This syndrome is defined by a cluster of medical conditions that raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. A diagnosis is important, because you can make health improvements that lessen the risk. Insulin resistance syndrome or metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when a person has 3 or more of the following: Blood pressure equal to or higher than 130/85 mm Hg Fasting blood sugar (glucose) equal to or higher than 100 mg/d L Large waist circumference (a waistline of 40 inches or more for men; 35 inches or more for a woman) Low HDL cholesterol (under 40mg/d L for men; under 50 mg/d L for women) Triglycerides equal to or higher than 150 mg/d L Insulin shock: A severe condition that occurs when the level of blood sugar drops quickly. Intermediate-acting Insulin: Covers insulin needs for about half the day or overnight; this type of insulin is often combined with rapid- or short-acting insulin. Includes NPH and Lente. Intermittent claudication: Pain in the muscles of the legs that occurs off and on, usually while walking or exercising; the pain results from atherosclerosis of the blood vessels feeding the muscles of the lower extremities. Claudication usually increases with age and is most common in people in their sixth or seventh decade of life. Risk factors for developing narrowing of the arteries that can cause claudication include smoking cigarettes, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Drugs are available to treat this condition. Jet injector: A device that uses high pressure to push insulin through the skin and into the tissue. Juvenile-onset diabetes: Former term used for type 1 diabetes. Ketoacidosis: See diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). Ketone bodies: Often simply called ketones, one of the products of fat burning in the body; when there is not enough insulin, your body is unable to use sugar (glucose) for energy and your body breaks down its own fat and protein. When fat is used, ketone bodies, an acid, appear in your urine and blood. A large amount of ketones in your system can lead to a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketones can be detected and monitored in your urine at home using products such as Ketostix, Chemstrips, and Acetest. When your blood sugar is consistently greater than 250 mg/dl, if you are ill or if you are pregnant and have diabetes, ketones should be checked regularly. Kidney disease (nephropathy): In a person with diabetes, nephropathy is any one of several conditions caused by changes in the very small blood vessels in the kidneys. These changes cause scarring of the kidneys, which can eventually lead to kidney failure. People who have had diabetes for a long time may develop nephropathy. An early sign of nephropathy is when proteins can be detected in the urine. Kidney threshold: See renal threshold. Lancet: A fine, sharp pointed needle for pricking the skin; used in blood sugar monitoring. Laser treatment: The use of a strong beam of light (laser) to heal a damaged area; a person with diabetes might receive laser treatments to heal blood vessels in the eye. Late-onset diabetes: Former term used for type 2 diabetes. Lipid: Another term for a fat or fat-like substance in the blood; the body stores fat as energy for future use, just like a car that has a reserve fuel tank. When the body needs energy, it can break down lipids into fatty acids and burn them like glucose. Excess amounts of fats in the diet can cause fat buildup in the walls of the arteries -- called ""atherosclerosis."" Excess amounts of calories from fats or other nutrients can lead to an increase in weight gain. Low blood sugar, low blood glucose: See hypoglycemia. Metabolism: All of the physical and chemical processes in the body that occur when food is broken down, energy is created and wastes are produced. Mg/d L (milligrams per deciliter): Measurement that indicates the amount of a particular substance such as glucose in a specific amount of blood. Mixed dose: A prescribed dose of insulin in which two types of insulin are combined and injected at once; a mixed dose commonly combines a fast-acting and longer-acting insulin. A mixed dose can either come in a pre-mixed syringe or mixed at the time of injection. A mixed dose may be prescribed to provide better blood sugar control. Nephropathy: Disease of the kidneys caused by damage to the small blood vessels or to the units in the kidneys that clean the blood; people who have had diabetes for a long time may develop nephropathy. Neurologist: A doctor who treats people who have problems of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and nerves). Neuropathy: Nerve damage; people who have had diabetes that is not well controlled may develop nerve damage. Non-insulin dependent diabetes: Former term for type 2 diabetes. Nutritionist: See dietitian. Obesity: A term uses to describe excess body fat; it is defined in terms of a person's weight and height, or his/her body mass index ( BMI). A BMI over 30 is classified as being obese. Obesity makes your body less sensitive to insulin's action. Extra body fat is thought to be a risk factor for diabetes. Ophthalmologist: A doctor who treats people with eye diseases. Optometrist: A person professionally trained to test the eyes and to detect and treat eye problems, as well as some diseases, by prescribing and adapting corrective lenses. Oral diabetes medications: Medications that people take to lower the level of sugar in the blood; oral diabetes medications are prescribed for people whose pancreas still produces some insulin. These medications are not used in diabetes during pregnancy. Pancreas: An organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is about the size of a hand; it makes insulin so the body can use sugar for energy. Peak action: The time when the effect of something is as strong as it can be, such as when insulin is having the most effect on blood sugar. Periodontal disease: Damage to the gums and tissues around the teeth; people who have diabetes are more likely to have periodontal disease than people who do not have diabetes. Peripheral neuropathy: A type of nerve damage most commonly affecting the feet and legs. Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD): An abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart, usually the hands and feet; often occurs as a result of decreased blood flow and narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis; people who have had diabetes for a long time may develop PVD. Podiatrist: A health professional who diagnoses and treats foot problems. Polydipsia: Excessive thirst that lasts for long periods of time; may be a sign of diabetes. Polyphagia: Excessive hunger and eating; may be a sign of diabetes. When insulin levels are decreased or there is insulin resistance, the cells of the body do not get enough sugar, and hunger develops. People with polyphagia often lose weight, even though they are eating more than normal, because the excess calories are lost in the urine as sugar (glucose). Polyunsaturated fat: A type of fat that can be substituted for saturated fats in the diet and can reduce LDL ''bad'' cholesterol. Polyuria: Increased need to urinate often; a common sign of diabetes. Protein: One of three main classes of food; proteins are made of amino acids, which are called the ""building blocks of the cells."" Cells need protein to grow and to mend themselves. Protein is found in many foods, like meat, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes, and dairy products. Rapid-acting Insulin: Covers insulin needs for meals eaten at the same time as the injection; this type of insulin is used with longer-acting insulin. Includes Humalog, Novolog, and Apidra. Rebound effect: See Somogyi effect. Regular insulin: A type of insulin that is rapid-acting. Renal: Relating to the kidneys. Retina: The center part of the back lining of the eye that senses light; it has many small blood vessels that are sometimes harmed when a person has had diabetes for a long time. Retinopathy: A disease of the small blood vessels in the retina of the eye. Risk factor: Anything that increases the chance of a person developing a disease or condition. Saccharin: An artificial sweetener that is used in place of sugar because it has no calories and does not increase blood sugar; it is sold as Sugar Twin and Sweet' N Low. Self-blood glucose monitoring: See home blood glucose monitoring. Short-acting Insulin: Covers insulin needs for meals eaten within 30-60 minutes; includes humulin or novolin, or Velosulin (in an insulin pump). Somogyi effect: Also called ""rebound effect,"" it occurs when there is an upward swing in blood sugar from an extremely low level of glucose in the blood to a very high level. It usually happens during the night and early morning hours. People who experience high levels of blood sugar in the morning may need to test their blood sugar levels in the middle of the night. If blood sugar levels are repeatedly low, addition of an evening snack or a lowering of insulin doses may be recommended. Sorbitol: A sugar -- produced from fruits -- that the body uses slowly; it is a sweetener used in diet foods and is called a ""nutritive sweetener"" because it has four calories in every gram, just like table sugar and starch. These compounds are used in many foods labeled as ''sugar free'' and ''no sugar added'' and can raise your blood glucose. Because a food is labeled ''sugar free,'' it doesn't necessarily mean carbohydrate-free. Stevia: A natural sugar substitute that has no calories; Truvia is the brand name for a sweetener made from the stevia leaf. Sucrose: Table sugar; a form of sugar that the body must break down into a more simple form before the blood can absorb it and take it to the cells. Sucralose: An artificial sweetener that is 600 times sweeter than sugar; can be used in cooking. Splenda is a brand name of sucralose. Sugar: A class of carbohydrates that tastes sweet; sugar is a quick and easy fuel for the body to use. Some types of sugar are lactose, glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Sulfonylureas: Pills or capsules that people take to lower the level of sugar in the blood; these oral diabetic medications work to lower your blood sugar by making your pancreas produce more insulin. Triglyceride: Fats carried in the blood from the food we eat; most of the fats we eat, including butter, margarines, and oils, are in triglyceride form. Excess triglycerides are stored in fat cells throughout the body. The body needs insulin to remove this type of fat from the blood. Type 1 diabetes: A type of diabetes in which the insulin-producing cells (called beta cells) of the pancreas are damaged; people with type 1 diabetes produce little or no insulin, so glucose cannot get into the body's cells for use as energy. This causes blood sugar to rise. People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. Type 2 diabetes: A type of diabetes in which the insulin produced is either not enough or the person's body does not respond normally to the amount present; therefore, glucose in the blood cannot get into the body's cells for use as energy. This results in an increase in the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. U-100: See unit of insulin. Ulcer: A break in the skin; a deep sore. People with diabetes may develop ulcers from minor scrapes on the feet or legs, from cuts that heal slowly, or from the rubbing of shoes that don't fit well. Ulcers can become infected and should be treated promptly. Ultralente insulin: A type of insulin that is long-acting; usually, the action of this type of insulin works for 25-36 hours after injection. This type of insulin has an onset of action four to five hours after injecting and works most powerfully at eight to 14 hours after injection. Other types of long-acting insulin include nsulin detemir ( Levemir) and iinsulin glargine ( Lantus).. Unit of insulin: The basic measure of insulin; U-100 is the most common concentration of insulin. U-100 means that there are 100 units of insulin per milliliter (ml) of liquid. For the occasional patient who has severe insulin resistance, insulin is available as a U-500 form. Unstable diabetes: See brittle diabetes. Urine testing: Checking urine to see if it contains ketones; if you have type 1 diabetes, are pregnant and have diabetes, or have gestational diabetes, your doctor may ask you to check your urine for ketones. This is an easy test done at home with a dipstick measure. Urologist: A doctor who specializes in treatment of the urinary tract for men and women, as well as treatment of the genital organs for males. Vaginitis: An inflammation or infection of the vaginal tissues; a woman with this condition may have itching or burning or vaginal discharge. Women who have diabetes may develop vaginitis more often than women who do not have diabetes. Vascular: Relating to the body's blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). Vein: A blood vessel that carries blood to the heart. Vitrectomy: A procedure in which the gel from the center of the eyeball is removed because it has blood and scar tissue that blocks vision; an eye surgeon replaces the clouded gel with a clear fluid. Xylitol: A nutritive sweetener used in dietary foods; it is a sugar alcohol that the body uses slowly, and contains fewer calories than table sugar."
89,"There isn't much you can do to stop a seizure once it starts. But you can help protect someone from harm during one. Some seizures are more dangerous than others, but most aren't an emergency. If you want to do something for the person, focus on keeping them safe. The type of seizure most people will think of is the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, better known as a grand mal seizure. They're frightening to watch, and someone who has one rarely knows or remembers what's happening. These seizures follow a pattern: The person seems to ""check out."" They won't answer if you talk to them. They won't react if you wave a hand in their face or shake them. They may collapse. Their muscles clench and they become as rigid as a board. ( This is the tonic phase. It lasts a few seconds.) Next comes a series of jerking movements. ( This is the clonic phase. It can last a few seconds or several minutes.) Eventually, the jerking stops and they're alert and can talk again, but they may be dazed or unsteady for a little while. Any generalized seizure can be dangerous because the person is unaware of their surroundings and can't protect themselves from harm. The uncontrolled thrashing raises their chances of getting hurt. Focal seizures are different. They're less intense and usually last no more than a minute or two. Part of their body, like an arm, might get stiff or go floppy. You may see repeated, rhythmic, or jerking movements in one place or that spread to different body parts. The person could zone out or stare at nothing. They may or may not realize what's happening but can't control it. When it's over, they won't remember a thing. It's all about taking precautions. For someone having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure: Give them room. Keep other people back. Clear hard or sharp objects, like glasses and furniture, away. Cushion their head. Loosen clothing around their neck, if you can safely. Don't try to hold them down or stop their movements. Don't put anything in their mouth. Contrary to popular myth, you can't swallow your tongue during a seizure. But putting something in their mouth could damage their teeth, or they might bite you. If their head isn't moving, turn it to one side. Look at your watch at the start of the seizure, so you can time its length. Remember, this probably isn't an emergency, although it may look like one. After the jerking stops, gently place them on their side, to help keep their airway clear. For milder seizures, like a bit of staring or shaking arms or legs, guide the person away from hazards, including traffic, stairs, and water. Don't leave someone who's had a seizure alone. Stay until they're fully aware of where they are and can respond normally when you talk to them. Speak calmly. Reassure them and explain what they missed if they're confused or frightened. Don't give them anything to drink or eat until they've completely recovered. Get medical help when: It's a child's first seizure. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. Another seizure begins soon after the first. The person doesn't ""wake up"" after the movements have stopped. The person was injured during the seizure. If you're concerned that something else may be wrong, or the person has another medical condition such as heart disease or diabetes, call a doctor."
90,"Drugs are usually the first choice of treatment, even in the late stages of atherosclerosis. Sometimes, though, more aggressive treatment is needed. Narrowed arteries can frequently be reopened with one of two treatments: stenting or bypass surgery. Because these atherosclerosis treatments come with risks, they are typically reserved for emergencies or when medications fail. A coronary angiogram is a special X-ray test that doctors use to identify coronary artery blockages and sometimes take action to open them up. In an angioplasty, a doctor first introduces a catheter (a narrow tube) into an artery in the leg or arm. The catheter is then moved to the area of concern. Usually this is the coronary arteries in the heart, or the arteries in the legs or brain. By injecting dye that is visible on live X-ray screens, the doctor can see blockages in the arteries. Using tiny tools on the catheter tip, he or she can often open blockages. A stent is a tiny cylinder of wire mesh. During an angioplasty, a balloon on the catheter tip is inflated inside a blockage to open it. Stents can be placed during this process and are left behind once the balloon and catheter are removed. Stents can relieve chronic symptoms of chest pain (angina), or reopen a blocked artery during a heart attack. Coronary angioplasty with stenting has a low complication rate. The recovery time is often less than one day. In bypass surgery, a surgeon ""harvests"" a segment of a blood vessel from the leg, arm, or chest. He or she sews this healthy vessel onto the coronary artery, rerouting blood around the clogged artery. Coronary artery bypass surgery -- or CABG (pronounced ""cabbage"") -- is the most commonly performed bypass surgery. CABG can provide relief from chest pain caused by atherosclerosis. Bypass surgery also leads to increased survival in people with diabetes or with multiple or severely blocked coronary arteries. As you would guess, CABG is major surgery. Although low overall, the risk of serious complications is similar to coronary stenting. The recovery time can take weeks, even months. Newer less-invasive forms of CABG, with shorter recovery times, are under evaluation. Which is the better treatment for the late stages of atherosclerosis -- stents or bypass surgery? Each procedure has advantages and disadvantages. Certain situations may make one procedure the clear choice, but often it's a judgment call. Living longer when you have multiple blockages. CABG is the best treatment for extending life in people with multiple severe blockages. CABG has been shown to extend life for patients with several patterns of severe blockages, and is clearly superior to stenting in these cases. Stenting has not been demonstrated to help people live longer. Pain relief. Sometimes treatment with drugs can't control chronic chest pain. Both CABG and stenting provide near-complete relief from angina more than 90% of the time. Angina often returns over time, though, which may lead to future procedures. Emergency treatment. During a heart attack, stents are usually better than CABG. Stents can be placed in minutes, without the risks and recovery time of major surgery. In rare circumstances, other tools and procedures may be used to help open arteries blocked by atherosclerosis plaques. Rotational atherectomy: A diamond burr rapidly spins and pulverizes plaque into tiny particles. The particles dissipate without causing major damage. Directional atherectomy: A rotating blade cuts slices of plaque, which are captured by the catheter and removed from the body. These procedures have good commonsense appeal, but they don't work as well as stenting or bypass surgery. They are rarely used, and only in special cases. Usually, atherectomy is used to improve the success of placing a stent. Stenting and coronary bypass surgery open blocked arteries, but they do nothing to prevent other atherosclerotic plaques from causing problems. After a procedure to open a blockage, it's more important than ever to reduce risk factors for atherosclerosis. After stenting or coronary bypass surgery, most people should take a daily regimen of anti-atherosclerosis medication that includes: A statin, to lower cholesterol levels An aspirin, to prevent blood clots Plavix (clopidogrel), Effient (prasugrel), or Brilinta (ticagrelor) also work to prevent clots, especially if a stent was placed. They are normally taken for one month up to a year depending on the type of stent. Blood pressure drugs, especially beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors Also important are three lifestyle habits proven to reduce heart disease: Exercise 30 minutes most days of the week Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily Most of all, don't smoke"
91,"When Essential Tremor significantly interferes with daily activities, long-term drug treatment is needed. Drugs most commonly used to treat the condition include beta-blockers (propranolol) and an epilepsy drug called primidone ( Mysoline). Topiramate ( Topamax), another drug used to treat epilepsy and migraine, helps some people. With the use of medication, people with essential tremor may see improvement in their ability to control their tremor and improvement in activities such as drinking from a cup or using food utensils. More specialized motor functions, such as being able to thread a needle, may still be too difficult. However, for most people, essential tremor is not disabling. Your health care provider will determine which treatment is best for you based on your medical history. The goal of treatment is to help provide maximum improvement in function while minimizing the side effects of the medication you are taking. For people with mild Essential Tremor, drug therapy is usually not necessary. Tremors may be lessened by minimizing exposure to emotional stress and avoiding substances, such as caffeine and nicotine, which may increase tremor. In social situations, a person with mild tremor can take a beta-blocker or drink a small amount of alcohol, if such treatments are approved by a doctor. Although alcohol may lessen the tremor, there is the danger of slowly increasing your intake. The beta-blocker propranolol ( Inderal) has been used to treat essential tremor for more than 40 years. Other beta-blockers such as metoprolol ( Lopressor) also may be effective. It is not clear how Inderal reduces tremors, but the drug may work by blocking nerve impulses to the muscles. Approximately 50% to 60% of people taking Inderal experience some improvement in function, but total tremor suppression usually is not achieved. The greatest improvement is in hand and voice tremors. The drugs may be taken once a day (for longer-acting formulation) or twice a day, depending upon the formulation used. Beta-blockers are not right for everyone with Essential Tremor. Side effects of beta-blockers may include: Slowing heart rate Drop in blood pressure Fainting Apathy Fatigue Erectile dysfunction Depression Some of these side effects may require that the treatment be stopped. Be sure to tell your doctor if you: Have asthma or other bronchial conditions (beta-blockers may cause or worsen asthma symptoms) Have coronary artery disease or certain heart arrhythmias Have depression Have kidney disease Have liver disease Have diabetes Are pregnant or nursing While you are taking Inderal, your health care provider will monitor your heart rate and blood pressure. In general, Inderal works over a long period of time to suppress tremors; however, nearly 10% of people will develop tolerance to the drug after a year. This means that the drug stops being effective when given in the same dose as when you began treatment. In this case your doctor will suggest another medication or treatment. Primidone ( Mysoline) is an anti-seizure drug that is also effective for treating essential tremor. It is most useful for people with hand tremor. Although it is not clear how it works, Mysoline appears to be as effective as Inderal, with significant suppression of tremor in most patients. However, as with Inderal, a percentage of people may develop tolerance to the treatment after about a year. In most cases, Mysoline is given to people who do not tolerate Inderal. Mysoline also can be given in addition to Inderal to improve symptoms. Mysoline may cause unwanted side effects in the short term (within the first few days of starting treatment); however, these side effects diminish with longer use. Side effects of Mysoline may include: Difficulty walking Dizziness Nausea Sleepiness Confusion Fatigue Serious complications with the drug are rare but could include blood cell and bone marrow problems. Your health care provider will check your blood counts every six to 12 months to screen for these problems. Mysoline has a drug interaction with phenobarbital, so the drugs should not be taken together. Before taking Mysoline, be sure to tell your doctor if you: Are pregnant or nursing Are taking any medications ( Mysoline may interact with several different types of drugs.) Have kidney or liver problems Have blood count problems In addition, you should avoid alcoholic beverages while taking Mysoline. Do not stop taking the drug suddenly or switch brands without first consulting with your health care provider. Topamax is widely used for epilepsy and migraine. Many doctors prescribe it for Essential Tremor. It is important to start with a very low dose and slowly increase the dose to avoid sleepiness. Many patients may experience a feeling of mental dullness or drowsiness and should consult with their doctor about adjusting the dose. As many as 30% to 40% of people do not tolerate this drug in higher doses. Experts use Neurontin for short-term treatment of Essential Tremor affecting the hands, although it is not known how the drug works. In most cases, it is not used in conjunction with other drugs. Side effects of Neurontin are rare but include: Sedation Walking difficulties Irritability Weight gain Some people with Essential Tremor report symptom relief after drinking a glass of wine or a cocktail. The effect usually lasts about an hour, but rebound tremors can occur after this time. It is generally not recommended that you attempt to treat essential tremor symptoms with alcohol. Benzodiazepines ( Ativan, Klonopin, Valium, and Xanax) may help people whose Essential Tremor is not improved by other drugs. These drugs appear to relieve tremors associated with emotional stress or anxiety. Side effects of benzodiazepines include confusion, memory loss, and sedation. For most people this is not a good long-term solution. Botox (subtype A) and Myobloc (subtype B) are the brand names for botulinum toxin, which can be used to treat some movement problems. The drugs work by weakening muscles to reduce tremor. The drug also can be used to treat voice or head tremors. This treatment involves an injection once every three months. Do not take this drug if you are pregnant or if you have myasthenia gravis, post-polio syndrome, or Eaton- Lambert syndrome. Side effects of Botox are rare, but may include excessive muscle weakness or loss of appetite. Currently, there is no evidence that alternative treatments are beneficial in treating Essential Tremor. Patients who have tremors that worsen with emotional stress may find relaxation therapies helpful at temporarily easing symptoms. Some herbal supplements may make tremor worse. Always consult your doctor before trying any alternative therapy."
92,"To check your child's tonsils, gently place the handle of a spoon, if possible, on his or her tongue and ask the child to say ""aaahhh"" while you shine a light on the back of the throat. If the tonsils look bright red and swollen, see your pediatrician or family doctor. Do not insist on doing this exam if you or the child is reluctant. Often tonsillitis due to a virus looks no different than one caused by bacteria. Your pediatrician will examine your child's tonsils and take a throat swab to check for strep throat. The test can be done with results available during the office visit. This is the rapid strep test. If this is negative a culture is done for confirmation which takes 24-48 hours. To check for a tonsillar abscess, the doctor will examine the tonsils and soft palate. Since most of the time infection is due to a virus and not a bacteria, antibiotics are not routinely needed. For a bacterial infection such as strep, the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic, usually for 10 days. Be sure to give your child the full course; if unchecked, strep bacteria can cause serious conditions such as an abscess or rheumatic fever (a heart condition). If the infection is due to strep, the contagious period is over after the first 24 hours of using antibiotics. If the throat culture is negative for bacteria, the infection is probably caused by a virus and requires only treatment for relief of symptoms. To ease pain, the doctor may also recommend acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil). Do not give your child aspirin, which has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a life-threatening condition. Gargling three times a day with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water) may relieve some of the pain. If your doctor discovers or suspects an abscess, you may need to be seen by an ear, nose, and throat doctor (called an ENT or otolaryngologist) to be evaluated for possible drainage of pus. Frequent cases of tonsillitis that affect your child's general health, interfere with school attendance, cause breathing problems (snoring), snoring, or difficulty swallowing may warrant surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy). This procedure is usually performed as outpatient surgery and your child can go home after a few hours of observation. Recovery is usually helped by rest and avoiding vigorous activity. Try to get your child to drink plenty of fluids, but don't force him or her to eat or drink. Older children should be given at least a pint of extra liquids per day. Although ice cream is usually the favorite food to cool the throat, it's okay to offer your child any foods he or she desires if it will make your child more comfortable and help him or her eat. Do only what your doctor advises to lower your child's fever. Hand washing remains crucial in preventing the spread of viruses and bacteria that cause tonsillitis. Avoid prolonged contact with anyone who has strep throat and has not been taking antibiotics for at least 24 hours. To be certain, avoid people who have been ill until such time as you are sure they no longer are. Tonsillectomy, the surgical removal of the tonsils, is one of the most commonly performed operations in children. Newer surgical techniques and advances in anesthesia have made this 20-minute operation much more tolerable and safer than ever before. The reasons for tonsillectomy have also changed. Until the 1980s, the most common reason for tonsillectomy was because of recurrent infection. In the last 30 years, although tonsillectomy is frequently performed for recurrent infections, the most common reason for removing tonsils is tonsil-enlargement (hypertrophy) causing obstructive symptoms such as snoring, sleep apnea, and difficulty swallowing."
93,"When you have ADHD, even simple tasks like grocery shopping or paying bills can sometimes feel overwhelming. Anyone can have mood swings, loss of focus, and trouble staying organized, but you might deal with these each day if you have ADHD. Your doctor can suggest medication or other treatment to help you focus better, but you can use a few tools and strategies to calm your busy mind and keep your emotions even. Make a schedule: Choose a time that's quiet and unhurried -- maybe at night before you go to bed -- and plan out the next day, down to the task. Use a reminder app, timer, or alarm to help you stick to that schedule. Alternate things you want to do with ones you don't to help your mind stay engaged. Be realistic about time: Your brain is wired differently than other people's, and it may take you longer to get things done. That's OK. Figure out a realistic time frame for your daily tasks -- and don't forget to build in time for breaks if you think you'll need them. Quiet your mind by quieting your space: When it's time to buckle down and get something done, take away the distractions. Use noise-canceling headphones to drown out sounds. Put your phone on silent. Work in a room with a door you can close. If you can do your job from home, set up the space in a way that helps you focus. Control clutter: Another way to quiet your brain is to clear your space of things you don't need. It can prevent distractions, and it can help you stay organized because you'll have fewer things to tidy up. Go paperless -- take your name off junk mailing lists and pay bills online. Get some organizational helpers like under-the-bed containers or over-the-door holders. Ask a friend to help if it seems like you're swimming in a sea of debris and you don't know where to start. Move your body: Exercise is good for everyone, but it can do more than improve your heart health if you have ADHD. Even a little regular exercise can ease ADHD symptoms. After you exercise, you'll feel more focused and have more energy to stay on task. Shoot for 20 to 30 minutes a day. If you work in an office, a brisk walk during lunch may be the ticket to beating your brain's afternoon slump. Learn to say no: Impulsive behavior can be a side effect of having ADHD. This means your brain might bite off more than it can handle. If you find yourself overwhelmed, try to say no to a few things. Ask yourself: Can I really get this done? Be honest with yourself and with others about what's possible and what's not. Once you get comfortable saying no, you'll be able to enjoy the things you say yes to even more. Reward yourself: Sticking to a task can be easier when there's a mood booster at the end. Before you tackle a project, decide on a reward for yourself once you're done. Positive reinforcement can help you stay the course."
94,"When you have type 2 diabetes, you want to get the most bang for your exercise buck. You'll need to fuel up the right way before, during, and after you work out. If you can manage your diabetes with diet and exercise alone, you don't need a pre-workout snack any more than someone without the disease. But if you take insulin or a drug that pushes your pancreas to make it, you might have to think before you snack. What to eat depends on a few things: How high your blood sugar is before you work out How long you'll be at it What time of day you plan to do it How your body reacts to exercise Check your blood sugar. If your reading is between 200 and 300 mg/dl and you've already eaten at least once that day, you probably don't need to eat anything. But you do need to check for ketones if it's over 250. Your body makes them when it burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. Don't exercise if you have them. If your reading is over 300, ask your doctor if exercise is OK. Otherwise, grab a snack with 15-30 grams of carbs. The lower your blood sugar is before you start and the longer you plan to work out, the larger your snack should be, up to 30 grams of carbs. You'll probably have to try a few options and amounts to see what works best. These snacks offer 15 grams of carbs with little prep time: 1 small piece of fresh fruit (4 ounces) 1 slice of bread (1 ounce) or 1 (6-inch) tortilla 1/2 cup of oatmeal 2/3 cup of plain fat-free yogurt or sweetened with sugar substitutes These have 30 grams of carbs: 1/2 peanut butter sandwich (1 slice whole wheat bread with 1 tablespoon peanut butter) and 1 cup milk 1 English muffin and 1 teaspoon low-fat margarine 3/4 cup whole grain, ready-to-eat cereal and 1/2 cup fat-free milk If your reading is below 150 mg/dl and you plan to work out for at least an hour, choose something with protein. These choices have it and less than 5 grams of carbs each: 15 almonds 1 tablespoon peanut butter 1 hard-boiled egg 1 piece of string cheese Many people with diabetes find that snacks with a ratio of 3 grams of carbs to 1 gram of protein work well. There's no need to take a protein supplement. Your food has enough. If you like to work out in the a.m., make sure you eat breakfast first, no matter what your blood sugar is. Exercising on an empty stomach in the morning can raise it. But food sends a signal to your pancreas to make insulin, which keeps it at a safe level. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, ask your doctor if you need to make adjustments for exercise. If you're going to head out for a bike trip, marathon, or day-long hike, take some snacks with you. Food may not be easy to carry around if you're in a race. Glucose gels and tablets or sports drinks can be good options. Count the carbs like you would with food. Tip: Your body will absorb carbs more quickly if they're in liquids and gels. This can come in handy if you're going full tilt. Check your blood sugar every hour. How many carbs your snacks should have depends on how much longer you plan to exercise and what your reading says. The idea is to eat enough carbs to keep you from having a low reading or just plain conking out, but not so many that your levels spike. It may take a few tries to figure out the right balance. Test again. If it's less than 100 mg/dl, have a snack. If your next regularly scheduled meal or snack is 30-60 minutes later, 15 grams of carbs should hold you. If your next meal or snack is more than an hour away, have about 15 grams of carbs and 7 or 8 grams of protein. Your sugar level can drop for up to 24 hours after moderate or intense exercise. If it's still below 100 mg/dl at bedtime, double up on your snack. If you take insulin, ask your doctor if it's OK to lower your dose at bedtime. Even if you don't need a snack right after you work out, you'll still need to build your energy back to help your muscles recover. The best time to eat is between 30 minutes and 2 hours after you're done."
95,"If you're one of the 100 million Americans in chronic pain, living a full and active life may seem out of your reach. But with the right treatment and support, it is possible. You've probably already visited your regular doctor, but there are also experts who specialize in treating pain who can work with your doctor and you to help you find relief. 1. Pain Medicine Specialists What they treat: Many different types of pain, including pain that's caused by surgery, injury, nerve damage, and conditions like diabetes. They also treat pain that doesn't have a clear cause. They use medications given by mouth or targeted injections. How to find one: Go to the websites of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (www.painmed.org) and the American Board of Pain Medicine (www.abpm.org) for directories of specialists. 2. Orthopedic Specialists and Surgeons What they treat: Injuries and diseases that affect your musculoskeletal system, which includes your bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Many specialize in certain parts of the body like the hips, knees, and shoulders. Once they diagnose your injury or disorder, they'll create a treatment plan that could include medicine. They might also recommend exercises (or refer you to a physical therapist) to help restore movement, strength, and function to your body and teach you how to prevent further issues. They are trained as surgeons, so if surgery is necessary, they can do it. How to find one: Go to either the website of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Medicine (www.aaomed.org) or the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (www.aaos.org). 3. Osteopathic Doctors What they treat: Although they're similar to medical doctors (they have also gone to medical school, but have DO after their names instead of MD), osteopathic doctors get extra training in the musculoskeletal system, which includes nerves, muscles, and bones. How to find one: Go to the website of the American Osteopathic Association (www.osteopathic.org). 4. Physiatrists or Rehabilitation Physicians What they treat: Injuries and conditions that affect how you move. They diagnose and treat pain related to nerves, muscles, and bones including carpal tunnel, neck and back pain, sports and work injuries, herniated discs, arthritis, pinched nerves, and concussions without the use of surgery. These specialists also treat post-surgery pain. How to find one: Go to the website of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (www.aapmr.org). 5. Rheumatologists What they treat: Rheumatic diseases, including arthritis, gout, and tendinitis, which can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints, muscles, and bones. Treatments may include medicines or anti-inflammatory or pain-blocking injections in your tendons or joints. How to find one: Go to the American College of Rheumatology's website (www.rheumatology.org). 6. Physical Therapists What they treat: These professionals work with people recovering from injury or surgery. Physical therapists may use massage, stretching, heat, ice, and exercise to help ease your pain and increase your mobility. How to find one: Go to the website of the American Physical Therapy Association (apta.org). 7. Acupuncturists What they treat: Acupuncturists are trained to work with a wide range of conditions causing pain, including headaches, knee pain, low back pain, neck pain, sciatica, sprains, and osteoarthritis. They insert very thin needles into specific points on your body, which may stimulate chemicals that help block pain signals. Although needles might sound scary, most people feel little or no discomfort. How to find one: Go to the websites of the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (aaaomonline.org), the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (www.nccaom.org), or the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (www.medicalacupuncture.org). 8. Chiropractors What they treat: Back pain is a common reason people seek out chiropractors, but these specialists treat pain from all kinds of conditions, injuries, and accidents -- even chronic headaches. They don't prescribe medicine, but they use hands-on techniques to offer relief. How to find one: Go to the American Chiropractic Association's website (www.acatoday.org) and search on their "" Find a Doctor"" page."
96,"Your diabetes can affect your teeth. Having uncontrolled diabetes can mean you're more likely to get gum disease or the other problems below. The good news: Good habits will help keep your mouth healthy. Diabetes can make you more likely to have cavities and fungal infections. Other potential problems include: Difficulty fighting off infections, including those that might lead to gum disease Slower healing time after dental surgery Dry mouth, called xerostomia, is common among people with diabetes. Saliva is important to oral health -- it helps wash away food particles and keep the mouth moist. When you don't produce enough moisture, bacteria thrive, tissues can get irritated and inflamed, and your teeth can be more prone to decay. Even so, you can protect your teeth and oral health. Here's how. Make sure you brush at least twice a day and floss once a day. Use an antibacterial mouth rinse twice a day to help curb bacteria that can cause plaque buildup on teeth and gums. Check your mouth for inflammation or signs of bleeding gums. If you notice either, let your dentist know as soon as possible. Have your teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months, or even every 3 or 4 months. Your dentist may suggest stepping up the cleaning schedule if you tend to build up plaque or tartar quickly. Make sure your dentist knows that you have diabetes. Give her the names of all prescription and over-the-counter drugs you take. Make sure your diabetes is well controlled. Your dentist may refer you to a periodontist -- a dentist who specializes in gum disease -- if your gum problems persist or seem to get worse."

Use cool compresses on the area or have the person take cool showers. Avoid strong soaps, detergents, and other chemicals. Stay in a cool room. Have the person wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothes. For a rash, apply calamine lotion. Call or see a doctor if home treatment doesn't help or symptoms get worse. Talk to the doctor about an alternative medicine and what drug(s) to avoid in the future. Serious symptoms may require a hospital stay."
98,"Younger women usually don't think about getting breast cancer. After all, under 7% of all breast cancer cases happen in women under 40. But it can happen at any age, and it's important to be aware of your risk factors, regardless of your age. The following put you at higher risk: A personal history of breast cancer or some noncancerous breast diseases A family history of breast cancer, particularly in a mother, daughter, or sister History of radiation treatments to the chest before age 40 Having a specific genetic defect such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation Getting your period before age 12 For some women, your age when you had your first child Other risk factors include heavy alcohol use, high intake of red meat, dense breasts, obesity, and race. Some studies suggest that taking birth control pills in the previous 10 years slightly increases the risk for developing breast cancer. Other studies, however, show no such effect. Hormone replacement therapy with estrogens and progestins has been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer development. Diagnosing breast cancer in women under 40 years old is more difficult, because their breast tissue is generally denser than in older women. By the time a lump in a younger woman's breast can be felt, the cancer may be advanced. In addition, breast cancer in younger women can be aggressive and less likely to respond to treatment. Women who are diagnosed at a younger age also are more likely to have a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Delays in diagnosing breast cancer can cause problems. Many younger women ignore the warning signs -- such as a breast lump or unusual nipple discharge -- because they believe they're too young to get breast cancer. They may assume a lump is a harmless cyst or other growth. Some doctors may also dismiss breast lumps in young women as cysts. In general, regular mammograms aren't recommended for women under 40 years of age, in part because breast tissue tends to be dense, making mammograms less effective. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 40 to 44 should have a choice to start yearly screening mammograms if they would like. Women ages 45 through 54 should have a mammogram each year and those 55 years and over should continue getting mammograms every 1 to 2 years.. Most experts believe the low risk at that age doesn't justify the exposure to radiation or the cost of mammography. But mammograms may be recommended for younger women with a family history of breast cancer and other risk factors. The American Cancer Society ( ACS) recommends that all women know how their breasts look and feel and report any changes to their doctor. The ACS states that research has not shown a clear benefit of performing regular breast self-exams. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of breast self-exam. Regular breast exams done at least every 3 years by your doctor are recommended for women beginning at age 20. Expert groups don't all agree when women should start getting mammograms and you should discuss with your doctor what's right for you. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every 2 years from ages 50 through 74 and also that the decision to start yearly screening mammograms before age 50 should be an individual one.. Talk to your doctor about when you should begin to have mammograms. For younger women, digital mammography may be an alternate to a standard mammogram. Digital mammography is better able to see abnormalities in dense breast tissue. Treatment decisions are made based whether or not it has spread beyond the breast, as well as the woman's general health and personal circumstances. Treatment options include: Surgery: either a lumpectomy, which involves removing the tumor and some surrounding tissue, or a mastectomy, which is the removal of a breast. Radiation is generally used following a lumpectomy, and chemotherapyand hormone therapy often are recommended after surgery to help destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent a return. Breast cancer treatment can affect your sexuality, fertility, and pregnancy. If you'd like to have children, talk to your doctor it before you begin treatment."
99,"Periodic limb movement disorder ( PLMD) is repetitive cramping or jerking of the legs during sleep. It is the only movement disorder that occurs only during sleep, and it is sometimes called periodic leg (or limb) movements during sleep. "" Periodic"" refers to the fact that the movements are repetitive and rhythmic, occurring about every 20-40 seconds. PLMD is also considered a sleep disorder, because the movements often disrupt sleep and lead to daytime sleepiness. PLMD may occur with other sleep disorders. It is often linked with restless legs syndrome, but they are not the same thing. Restless legs syndrome is a condition involving strange sensations in the legs (and sometimes arms) while awake and an irresistible urge to move the limbs to relieve the sensations. At least 80% of people with restless legs syndrome have PLMD, but the reverse is not true. When PLMD was first described in the 1950s, it was called nocturnal myoclonus. Nocturnal means night, and myoclonus is a rapid, rhythmic contraction of a group of muscles similar to that seen in seizures. PLMD movements are not myoclonus, however, and the original name is not used today. PLMD can occur at any age. Like many sleep disorders, PLMD is more common in middle-aged and older people. Persistent sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness are not part of normal aging. Periodic limb movement disorder can be primary or secondary. Secondary PLMD is caused by an underlying medical problem. Primary PLMD, on the other hand, has no known cause. It has been linked to abnormalities in regulation of nerves traveling from the brain to the limbs, but the exact nature of these abnormalities is not known. Secondary PLMD has many different causes, including the following. Many of these are also causes of restless legs syndrome. Diabetes mellitus Iron deficiency Spinal cord tumor Spinal cord injury Sleep apnea syndrome - Breathing difficulties that disrupt sleep, causing daytime sleepiness and a number of other problems Narcolepsy - A sleep disorder involving excessive sleepiness and overpowering urge to sleep during waking hours Uremia - Build-up of waste products in the blood because of poor kidney function Anemia - Low level of hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen in the blood Medication - Neuroleptics and other antidopaminergic agents such as Haldol, dopaminergic agents such as Sinemet (despite the fact that Sinemet is often a treatment for PLMD), or tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline ( Elavil) Withdrawal from sedative medications such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines (such as Valium) The most common symptoms noted by people with PLMD are not leg movements but poor sleep and daytime sleepiness. Many people with PLMD are unaware of their leg movements unless their bed partner tells them. Leg movements involve one or both limbs. Typically the knee, ankle, and big toe joints all bend as part of the movements. The movements vary from slight to strenuous and wild kicking and thrashing. The movements last about 2 seconds (and thus are much slower than the leg jerks of myoclonus). The movements are rhythmic and repetitive and occur every 20-40 seconds. In most people with PLMD, poor sleep and daytime sleepiness are the most bothersome symptoms. Many people do not link their sleep problem with leg movements. Sleep disturbance has many different causes. Depending on how you describe your symptoms, your health care provider may ask you many detailed questions. These questions concern your medical problems now and in the past, family medical problems, medications you take, your work and travel history, and your habits and lifestyle. A detailed physical examination will look for signs of an underlying cause for your sleep problem. There is no lab test or imaging study that can prove that you have PLMD. However, certain tests can identify underlying medical causes such as anemia, other deficiencies, and metabolic disorders that could cause PLMD. You may have blood drawn to check your blood cell counts and hemoglobin, basic organ functions, chemistry, and thyroid hormone levels. You also may be checked for certain infections that could cause secondary PLMD. A urine sample may be collected to check for traces of drugs that can cause sleep problems. Polysomnography (sleep lab testing) is the only way to confirm that you have PLMD. As you sleep in the lab, your leg movements can be documented. At any time during your evaluation, your health care provider may refer you to a neurologist (a specialist in disorders of the nervous system). This specialist can help rule out other neurological problems and confirm the diagnosis of PLMD. Treatment does not cure the disorder but usually relieves symptoms. Treatment involves medication that either reduces the movements or helps the person sleep through the movements. Therapy does not cure PLMD but relieves symptoms. Note that many of the medications used to treat PLMD are the same as those used to treat restless legs syndrome. Benzodiazepines: These drugs suppress muscle contractions. They are also sedatives and help you sleep through the movements. Clonazepam ( Klonopin), in particular, has been shown to reduce the total number of periodic limb movements per hour. It is probably the most widely used drug to treat PLMD. Dopaminergic agents: These drugs increased the levels of an important neurotransmitter (brain chemical) called dopamine, which is important in regulating muscle movements. These medications seem to improve the condition in some people but not in others. Widely used examples are a levodopa/carbidopa combination ( Sinemet) and pergolide ( Permax). Anticonvulsant agents: These medications reduce muscle contractions in some people. The most widely used anticonvulsant in PLMD is gabapentin ( Neurontin). GABA agonists: These agents inhibit release of certain neurotransmitters that stimulate muscle contractions. The result is relaxation of contractions. The most widely used of these agents in PLMD is baclofen ( Lioresal). Your health care provider will ask you to return for one or more follow-up visits after trying his or her recommendations. It is very important that your bed partner understand the nature of PLMD and that you are not intending to injure him or her with your movements. See your health care provider regularly for proper care of any medical or mental problems. Primary PLMD may be chronic (permanent). Many people with primary PLMD have improved nighttime sleep (remission) but experience one or more relapses over time. Secondary PLMD may cease with treatment of the underlying cause.

100,"Can't go? You're not alone. About 20% of Americans have occasional constipation -- bowel movements less than three times a week. Or if they do poop, the output is hard, small, and painful to produce. Sometimes, a medical disorder like irritable bowel syndrome can cause constipation. Those issues often need care and treatment from your doctor. But for many people, the problem will be short-term and easy to fix. To figure out what has you stopped up, ask yourself these questions: Is it time to fiber up? Moving your bowels regularly takes fiber -- lots of it. We're talking about 3 to 5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day. Go easy on meat and dairy and load up on produce. Just be sure you add it to your diet gradually. Skip fast and prepared foods. They may be quick and easy, but they're almost always low in fiber. How are my fluid levels? To move waste through your intestines, you gotta drink up! If you don't drink enough water, you can get backed up. Am I active? It's as simple as this: Moving your body helps move your bowels, so too much time sitting can lead to trouble on the throne. Are supplements the problem? Iron or calcium supplements can cause constipation in some people. It's more likely with calcium carbonate supplements than with calcium citrate. If you take calcium or iron supplements, take extra care to eat enough fiber, drink plenty of water, and stay active. If that doesn't help, talk to your doctor about other options to get you going or whether you can get these nutrients through your diet instead. Am I stressed? When your brain's stress response systems get flipped on, it causes changes in your body. The digestive system is especially sensitive to stress, and constipation can be one response. Whether it's for business or pleasure, travel is stressful. When it disrupts your regular routines, especially eating patterns, your pooping can get off-schedule as well. Do I ignore the urge? Maybe you're too busy to stop every time your body signals it's time to poop. Maybe you don't like using public restrooms, or any except your own at home. Here's the problem with ignoring the urge: Sooner or later, you may stop feeling the signals. Does pregnancy play a role? Overall, women get constipated more often than men. That's especially true during pregnancy, when hormone changes can easily throw off your digestive system. Add the pressure a growing baby puts on your plumbing, and it's no surprise you have trouble going. Problems with pooping are also common after childbirth. What about my age? The chance of having trouble moving your bowels goes up as you get older, so make a point to get more exercise, drink more water, and eat more fiber. Are my medications part of the problem? Pain relievers, iron supplements, some antidepressants, and diuretics are just a few common drugs that can have this effect. Also on the list are meds for diabetes and Parkinson's disease, plus some blood pressure treatments. Over-the-counter medications like antacids can also stop things up. Could it be a more serious problem? It's rare, but possible. Discuss it with your doctor. If you've ruled out other causes, he may want to explore: Problems with the muscles that squeeze your colon. Hormone diseases like diabetes or an over- or underactive thyroid gland. Diseases that affect the nerves around your colon or rectum, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injuries. Colon trouble. Tumors and other things that block your colon or rectum can prevent poop from moving out of your body."
101,"Costochondritis is an inflammation of the junctions where the upper ribs join with the cartilage that holds them to the breastbone, or sternum. The condition causes localized chest pain that you can reproduce by pushing on the cartilage in the front of your ribcage. Costochondritis is a relatively harmless condition and usually goes away without treatment. The cause is usually unknown, but may happen from increased activity involving the arms. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } . Costochondritis (with unknown cause) is a common cause of chest pain in children and adolescents. It accounts for 10% to 30% of all chest pain in children. Annually, doctors evaluate about 650,000 cases of chest pain in young people ages 10 to 21. The peak age for the condition is ages 12-14. Costochondritis is also considered as a possible diagnosis for adults who have chest pain. Chest pain in adults is considered a potentially serious sign of a heart problem by most doctors until proven otherwise. Chest pain in adults usually leads to a battery of tests to rule out heart attack and heart disease. If those tests are normal and your physical exam is consistent with costochondritis, your doctor will diagnose costochondritis as the cause of your chest pain. It is important, however, for adults with chest pain to be examined and tested for heart disease before being diagnosed with costochondritis. It is often difficult to distinguish between the two without further testing. The condition affects females more than males (70% versus 30%). Costochondritis may also occur as the result of an infection or as a complication of surgery on your sternum. Tietze syndrome is often referred to as costochondritis, but the two are distinct conditions. You can tell the difference by noting the following: Tietze syndrome is rare. It usually comes on abruptly, with chest pain radiating to your arms or shoulder and lasting several weeks. Tietze syndrome is accompanied by a localized swelling at the painful area (the junction of the ribs and breastbone). Costochondritis is an inflammatory process but usually has no definite cause. Repeated minor trauma to the chest wall, overuse of the arms, or viral respiratory infections can commonly cause chest pain due to costochondritis. Occasionally, costochondritis as a result of bacterial infections can occur in people who use IV drugs or who have had surgery to their upper chest. After surgery, the cartilage can become more prone to infection, because of reduced blood flow in the region that has been operated on. Different types of infectious diseases can cause costochondritis. Viral: Costochondritis commonly occurs with viral respiratory infections because of the inflammation of the area from the viral infection itself, or from straining from coughing. Bacterial: Costochondritis may occur after surgery and be caused by bacterial infections. Fungal: Fungal infections are rare causes of costochondritis. Chest pain associated with costochondritis is usually preceded by exercise, minor trauma, or an upper respiratory infection. The pain, which may be dull, usually will be sharp and located on your front chest wall. It may radiate to your back or abdomen and is more common on your left side. There can be pain with a deep breath or cough. The most common sites of pain are your fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. This pain increases as you move your trunk or take deep breaths. Conversely, it decreases as your movement stops or with quiet breathing. The reproducible tenderness you feel when you press on the rib joints (costochondral junctions) is a constant feature of costochondritis. Without this tenderness, a diagnosis of costochondritis is unlikely. Tietze syndrome, on the other hand, exhibits swellings at the rib-cartilage junction. Costochondritis has no noticeable swelling. Neither condition involves pus or abscess formation. Tietze syndrome usually affects the junctions at the second and third ribs. The swelling may last for several months. The syndrome can develop as a complication of surgery on your sternum months to years after the operation. When costochondritis occurs as a result of infection after surgery, you will see redness, swelling, or pus discharge at the site of the surgery. Call the doctor for any of the following symptoms: Trouble breathing High fever Signs of infection such as redness, pus, and increased swelling at the rib joints Continuing or worsening pain despite medication Nausea Sweating Dizziness Go to a hospital's emergency room if you have difficulty breathing or any of the following symptoms occur. These symptoms are generally not associated with costochondritis: High fever not responding to fever-reducers such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil) Signs of infection at the tender spot, such as pus, redness, increased pain, and swelling Persistent chest pain of any type associated with nausea, sweating, left arm pain, or any generalized chest pain that is not well localized. These may be signs of a heart attack. If you are not sure what is causing your condition, always go to the emergency room. There is no specific test for diagnosing costochondritis. Personal history and a physical exam are the mainstays of diagnosis. However, tests are sometimes used to rule out other conditions that can have similar symptoms but are more dangerous, such as heart disease. The doctor will seek to reproduce tenderness over the affected rib joints, usually over the fourth to sixth ribs in costochondritis, and over the second to third ribs in Tietze syndrome. In costochondritis with unknown causes, there is no significant swelling of costochondral joints. There is swelling and tenderness of the rib-cartilage junctions in Tietze syndrome. Although some doctors use the terms costochondritis and Tietze syndrome interchangeably, Tietze syndrome has a sudden onset without any preceding respiratory illness or any history of minor trauma. In Tietze syndrome, there is frequently radiation of pain to arms and shoulders, as well as pain and tenderness associated with swelling at the spot that hurts. Blood work and a chest X-ray are usually not helpful in diagnosing costochondritis. However, after sternum surgery, or for people at risk for heart disease, doctors will be more likely to do tests if you have chest pain and possible costochondritis to be certain you do not have any infection or other serious medical problems. To determine if infection is the cause of chest pain, doctors will: Look for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pus, and drainage at the site of surgery Order a more sophisticated imaging study of the chest called a gallium scan, which will show increased uptake of the radioactive material gallium in an area of infection Check the white blood cell count to see if it is elevated, a sign of infection Order a chest X-ray if pneumonia is a suspected cause of chest pain Order an ECG and other tests if a heart problem is suspected Costochondritis is a less common cause of chest pain in adults but occurs fairly frequently in people who have had cardiac surgery. The diagnosis can only be reached after excluding more serious causes of chest pain that are related to the heart and lungs. The appropriate studies, such as ECG, chest X-rays, blood test for heart damage, and other studies will be done as indicated. Any chest pain in adults is taken seriously and not ignored. If you are concerned, consult with your doctor. The following home remedies may provide relief from costochondritis: Taking pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or naproxen ( Aleve) as needed Using local heat or ice to relieve pain Avoiding unnecessary exercise or activities that make the symptoms worse; avoiding contact sports until there is improvement in symptoms, and then returning to normal activities only as tolerated Doing stretching exercises Costochondritis responds to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen ( Advil or Motrin) and naproxen ( Aleve). You may be given a local anesthetic and steroid injection in the area that is tender if normal activities become very painful and the pain does not respond to drugs. Infectious (bacterial or fungal) costochondritis should be treated initially with intravenous (in the vein or IV) antibiotics. Afterward, antibiotics by mouth or by IV should be continued for another two to three weeks to complete the therapy. Surgical removal of the sore cartilage may be required if there is no response to medical therapy for costochondritis. Your doctor will refer you to a surgeon for consultation should this option be considered necessary. You should see a doctor during recovery, and then once a year. Infectious costochondritis requires long-term observation. Because inflammatory costochondritis has no definite cause, there is no good way to prevent it. Noninfectious costochondritis will go away on its own, with or without anti-inflammatory treatment. Most people will recover fully. Infectious costochondritis responds well to IV antibiotics and surgical repair, but recovery may take a long time."
102,"You want to have a child, but you have endometriosis. Can you get pregnant? The short answer is yes, but it might be difficult. Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases, and it's the leading cause of infertility. It affects about 5 million women in the United States, many in their 30s and 40s. Nearly 2 of every 5 women who can't get pregnant have it. It's a painful condition in which tissue that should be growing inside the uterus grows on the outside. These growths can block your fallopian tubes or cover your ovaries. The good news is that there are treatment options, but each has different rates of success. The growths are benign, meaning they are not cancerous. But when they interfere with your reproductive organs, your ability to get pregnant can become an issue: When endometrial tissue wraps around your ovaries, it can block your eggs from releasing. The tissue can block sperm from making its way up your fallopian tubes. It can also stop a fertilized egg from sliding down your tubes to your uterus. A surgeon can fix those problems, but endometriosis can make it hard for you to conceive in other ways: It can change your body's hormonal chemistry. It can cause your body's immune system to attack the embryo. It can affect the layer of tissue lining your uterus where the egg implants itself. There are several treatment options for endometriosis. First, your doctor can surgically remove the endometrial tissue. This clears the way for the sperm to fertilize the egg. If surgery isn't an option, you might consider intrauterine insemination ( IUI), which involves placing your partner's sperm directly in your uterus. Your doctor may consider pairing IUI with something called âcontrolled ovarian hyperstimulationâ -- using medicine to help your ovaries produce more eggs. Women who use this technique are more likely to conceive than those who don't get help. In vitro fertilization ( IVF) is also another option. It can increase your chances of conceiving, although the statistics on IVF pregnancies vary. One study showed that women's odds of getting pregnant by IVF were four times greater if they had Gn RH agonist (hormone) treatment beforehand, but it cautioned that more research is needed."

Without treatment, it will get worse over time and eventually overwhelm your immune system. Most people don't know right away when they've been infected with HIV, but a short time later, they may have symptoms. This is when your body's immune system puts up a fight, typically within 2 to 6 weeks after you've gotten the virus. It's called acute retroviral syndrome or primary HIV infection. The symptoms are similar to those of other viral illnesses, and they're often compared to the flu. They typically last a week or two and then completely go away. They include: Headache Fatigue Aching muscles Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes A red rash that doesn't itch, usually on your torso Fever If you have symptoms like these and might have been exposed to someone with HIV in the past 2-6 weeks, you should go to a doctor and ask that you get an HIV test, even if you have had a negative test in the past. You may be shocked to learn that you have HIV, but fortunately, a combination, or ""cocktail,"" of medications (called HIV drugs, or antiretroviral therapy) can help fight HIV, keep your immune system healthy, and prevent spreading the virus to others. If you take these medications and have healthy habits, your HIV infection will likely not progress further. After your immune system loses the battle with HIV, the flu-like symptoms will go away. Doctors may call this the asymptomatic or clinical latent period. Most people don't have symptoms you can see or feel. You may not realize you're infected and can pass HIV on to others. This stage can last 10 years or more. During this time, untreated HIV will be killing CD4 T-cells and destroying your immune system. Your doctor can check how many you have with blood tests ( normal number of CD4 cells iscounts are between 450 and 1,400 cells per microliter). But without treatment, the number of CD4 cells will As the number drops, and you will vulnerable to other infections. The key is not to let this phase go on for long. Fortunately, if you start HIV drugs during this phase, they willa combination, or ""cocktail,"" of medications can help fight HIV, rebuild your immune system, and prevent spreading the virus. If you're takeing your medications, keep your doctor appointments, and have healthy habits, you should be able to lead a healthy life. AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection. This is usually when your CD4 T-cell number drops below 200. You can also be diagnosed with AIDS if you have an "" AIDS defining illness"" such as Kaposi's sarcoma (a form of skin cancer) or pneumocystis pneumonia (a lung disease). If you didn't know you were infected with HIV earlier, you may realize it after you have some of these symptoms: Being tired all of the time Swollen lymph nodes in your neck or groin Fever that lasts for more than 10 days Night sweats Unexplained weight loss Purplish spots on your skin that don't go away Shortness of breath Severe, long-lasting diarrhea Yeast infections in your mouth, throat, or vagina Bruises or bleeding you can't explain People with AIDS who don't take medication only survive about 3 years, even less if they get a dangerous infection. But HIV can still be treated at this stage. If you start on HIV drugs, stay on them, follow your doctor's advice regarding other conditions you may have, and have But with the right treatment and a healthy lifestyle, you can live a long time."
104,"HIV gets passed from person to person in blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), fluids from the vagina and rectum, and breast milk. So you're at risk when body fluids from someone who's infected could get into and mix with yours. Some things you do now can raise your chances of getting HIV, but you can't change things you were born with or happened in the past. One of the most common ways you can get HIV is by having vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV. You could pass HIV during oral sex, too, but that's less common. It's also risky when you don't know whether or not your partner is HIV-positive, because they could be. The more sexual partners you have, the more your odds of catching HIV go up. Using condoms, barriers, and dental dams will help a lot to keep you safe, but they're not perfect. Your choice of partner also matters. Having sex with someone who has a higher chance of getting (and therefore having) HIV -- a sex worker or an IV drug user, for example -- raises your chances as well. The other big risk is reusing needles, syringes, or other equipment an HIV-positive person used to inject drugs, whether they were prescribed by a doctor or illegal. You shouldn't even reuse your own. You could also get HIV from a needle used for piercing or tattooing if it wasn't sterilized after piercing or tattooing someone with HIV. An accidental stick from a contaminated needle or medical device could cause HIV, but that's very rare. Because these can weaken your judgment, you may be more likely to do other risky things, such as having unprotected sex. An STD such as herpes, chlamydia, syphilis, or gonorrhea may cause changes in the tissue of the vagina or penis that make it easier for HIV to pass to you while you're having sex. A mother infected with HIV can give her baby the virus before or during birth, or by breastfeeding. This is one reason why pregnant women should get tested for HIV. It's possible if you had a blood transfusion or were given blood products before 1985. Since then, all blood in the United States and Western Europe gets tested for HIV. Some people have fewer copies of a gene that helps to fight HIV. We might someday have a test that can tell you if you're more likely to get HIV and develop AIDS, but there isn't one yet."

For many years, the only treatment options available for people with missing teeth were bridges and dentures. But, today, dental implants are available. Dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth. There are many advantages to dental implants, including: Improved appearance. Dental implants look and feel like your own teeth. And because they are designed to fuse with bone, they become permanent. Improved speech. With poor-fitting dentures, the teeth can slip within the mouth causing you to mumble or slur your words. Dental implants allow you to speak without the worry that teeth might slip. Improved comfort. Because they become part of you, implants eliminate the discomfort of removable dentures. Easier eating. Sliding dentures can make chewing difficult. Dental implants function like your own teeth, allowing you to eat your favorite foods with confidence and without pain. Improved self-esteem. Dental implants can give you back your smile and help you feel better about yourself. Improved oral health. Dental implants don't require reducing other teeth, as a tooth-supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant, more of your own teeth are left intact, improving long-term oral health. Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth, improving oral hygiene. Durability. Implants are very durable and will last many years. With good care, many implants last a lifetime. Convenience. Removable dentures are just that; removable. Dental implants eliminate the embarrassing inconvenience of removing dentures, as well as the need for messy adhesives to keep them in place. Success rates of dental implants vary, depending on where in the jaw the implants are placed but, in general, dental implants have a success rate of up to 98%. With proper care (see below), implants can last a lifetime. Embed Asset Override In most cases, anyone healthy enough to undergo a routine dental extraction or oral surgery can be considered for a dental implant. Patients should have healthy gums and enough bone to hold the implant. They also must be committed to good oral hygiene and regular dental visits. Heavy smokers, people suffering from uncontrolled chronic disorders -- such as diabetes or heart disease -- or patients who have had radiation therapy to the head/neck area need to be evaluated on an individual basis. If you are considering implants, talk to your dentist to see if they are right for you. In general, dental implants are not covered by dental insurance at this time. Coverage under your medical plan may be possible, depending on the insurance plan and/or cause of tooth loss. Detailed questions about your individual needs and how they relate to insurance should be discussed with your dentist and insurance provider. The first step in the dental implant process is the development of an individualized treatment plan. The plan addresses your specific needs and is prepared by a team of professionals who are specially trained and experienced in oral surgery and restorative dentistry. This team approach provides coordinated care based on the implant option that is best for you. Next, the tooth root implant, which is a small post made of titanium, is placed into the bone socket of the missing tooth. As the jawbone heals, it grows around the implanted metal post, anchoring it securely in the jaw. The healing process can take from six to 12 weeks. Embed Asset Override Once the implant has bonded to the jawbone, a small connector post -- called an abutment -- is attached to the post to securely hold the new tooth. To make the new tooth or teeth, your dentist makes impressions of your teeth, and creates a model of your bite (which captures all of your teeth, their type, and arrangement). The new tooth or teeth is based on this model. A replacement tooth, called a crown, is then attached to the abutment. Instead of one or more individual crowns, some patients may have attachments placed on the implant that retain and support a removable denture. Your dentist also will match the color of the new teeth to your natural teeth. Because the implant is secured within the jawbone, the replacement teeth look, feel, and function just like your own natural teeth. Most people who have received dental implants say that there is very little discomfort involved in the procedure. Local anesthesia can be used during the procedure, and most patients report that implants involve less pain than a tooth extraction. Embed Asset Override After the dental implant, mild soreness can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications, such as Tylenol or Motrin. Dental implants require the same care as real teeth, including brushing, flossing, rinsing with an antibacterial mouthwash, and regular dental check-ups."
106,"Lots of men hate the idea of using incontinence products -- so-called adult diapers, urine collection bags, and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male incontinence, these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options. Incontinence pads and other absorbent products. While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, knowing you're protected can provide you with a sense of security. Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a drip collector -- an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases, an incontinence pad inserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger guard or pair of absorbentunderwear may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you. External catheters. Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like condoms. The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer. Drainage bags. These are just the plastic bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. Underpads. These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. Urinals and other toilet substitutes. When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, plastic urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinence, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom. Penile clamps. They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps -- also called ""external compression devices"" -- can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time. Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet. If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help. Some guys don't want to try urinary incontinence products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems. Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by. They may not be a long-term solution, but they can vastly improve your quality of life right now."
107,"Cold sweats, trembling hands, intense anxiety, a general sense of confusion -- these are signs of low blood sugar. Your doctor may call it hypoglycemia. It often happens when you take too much insulin. Hypoglycemia happens to many people with diabetes. It can be serious. Thankfully, most insulin problems can be avoided if you follow a few simple rules. Several things can put too much insulin in your system. It most often happens when you: Misread the syringes or vials: This is easy to do if you're unfamiliar with a new product. Use the wrong type of insulin: Let's say you usually take 30 units of long-acting and 10 units of short-acting insulin. It's easy to get them mixed up. Take insulin, but don't eat: Rapid-acting and short-acting insulin injections should be taken just before or with meals. Your blood sugar rises after meals. Taking rapid-acting or short-acting insulin without eating could lower your sugar to a dangerous level. Inject insulin in an arm or leg just before exercise . Physical activity can lower your blood sugar levels and change how your body absorbs insulin. Inject in an area that isn't affected by your exercise. If you have low blood sugar because of an insulin overdose, you may have: Anxiety Confusion Extreme hunger Fatigue Irritability Sweating or clammy skin Trembling hands If your blood sugar levels continue to fall, you could have seizures or pass out. Don't panic. Most insulin overdoses can be treated at home. Follow these steps if you're able: Check your blood sugar. You'll need to know where you're starting from. Drink one-half cup of regular soda or sweetened fruit juice, and eat a hard candy or have glucose paste, tablets, or gel. If you skipped a meal, eat something now. Something with 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrates should raise your blood sugar. Rest. Get off your feet and take a break. Recheck your blood sugar after 15 or 20 minutes. If it's still low, take another 15 to 20 grams of a quick-acting sugar, and eat something if you can. Pay attention to how you feel for the next few hours. If you still have symptoms, check your sugar again an hour after eating. Keep snacking if your sugar is low. Get medical help if your sugar level stays low after 2 hours or if your symptoms don't get better. Don't worry about pushing your sugar too high if it's only for a short time. One high level won't hurt you, but a very low level can. If you're unconscious or too confused or are having seizures, those around you will need to take control. Give your family and friends these instructions: If you lose consciousness, they should call 911 immediately. They may need to inject you with something called glucagon. It's an insulin antidote. If you're prone to low blood sugar, ask your doctor if you should have glucagon on hand at home. If you're alert enough to follow instructions, they should give you sweet juice to drink. If your symptoms don't steadily improve during the next hour, they should call 911. There are things you can do to prevent an overdose: Keep a consistent schedule. It'll make it much easier for you to stay on track. Eat something at every mealtime. Even if you're not hungry, have some bread, a glass of skim milk, or a small serving of fruit. Never skip meals when you've taken insulin. Be prepared. Expect that you'll have insulin complications at some point. Pack hard candies in your bag and your partner's. Keep some in the car and in your travel bag, too. Make sure friends and family know the way you react to hypoglycemia. It'll help them take action if your low blood sugar levels make you confused. Wear a medical alert bracelet. Make sure it says you use insulin."
108,"Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer. It's usually found on areas of the body damaged by UV rays from the sun or tanning beds. Sun-exposed skin includes the head, neck, chest, upper back, ears, lips, arms, legs, and hands. SCC is a fairly slow-growing skin cancer. Unlike other types of skin cancer, it can spread to the tissues, bones, and nearby lymph nodes, where it may become hard to treat. When caught early, it's easy to treat. Certain things make you more likely to develop SCC: Older age Male Fair-skinned Blue, green, or gray eyes Blonde or red hair Spend time outside; exposed to the sun's UV Rays Tanning beds and bulbs Long-term exposure to chemicals such as arsenic in the water Bowen's disease, HPV, HIV, or AIDS Exposed to radiation Inherited DNA condition .image-container-right { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; } @media screen and (min-width: 25rem) { .image-container-right { float: right; margin-left: 2rem; width: 17.5rem; } } Full size image. SCC usually begins as a dome-shaped bump or a red, scaly patch of skin. It's usually rough and crusty, and can bleed easily when scraped. Large growths may itch or hurt. It may also pop through scars or chronic skin sores, so check for any changes and report them to your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist who specializes in skin conditions. He will ask about your medical history, your history of severe sunburns or indoor tanning, any pain or symptoms you're having, and when the spot first appeared. You'll have a physical exam to check the size, shape, color, and texture of the spot. The dermatologist will also look for other spots on your body and feel your lymph nodes to make sure they aren't bigger or harder than normal. If your doctor thinks a bump looks questionable, he'll remove a sample of the spot (a skin biopsy) to send to a lab for testing. Squamous cell carcinoma can usually be treated with minor surgery that can be done in a doctor's office or hospital clinic. Depending on the size and location of the SCC, your doctor may choose to use any of the following techniques to remove it: Excision: cutting out the cancer spot and some healthy skin around it, then stitching up the wound Surgery using a small hand tool and an electronic needle to kill cancer cells Mohs surgery: excision and then inspecting the excised skin using a microscope; this requires stitching up the wound Lymph node surgery: remove a piece of the lymph node; uses general anesthesia Dermabrasion: ""sanding"" your affected area of skin with a tool to make way for a new layer Cryosurgery: freezing of the spot using liquid nitrogen Topical chemotherapy: a gel or cream applied to the skin, sometimes with microneedling Targeted drug treatment Photodynamic therapy (a photosensitizing solution applied to your skin then activated with a light or daylight, or sometimes with intense pulsed light) Ablative and nonablative lasers, or chemical peels Superficial radiation therapy Avoid the sun during peak hours. Use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily, even when it's cloudy and raining, to exposed skin, and reapply frequently when outside. Wear clothing to cover exposed areas. Avoid tanning beds. If you've been diagnosed with skin cancer, you're more likely to get it again -- so visit your doctor for regular skin checks. There are preventive supplements such as nicotinamide (vitamin B) and Heliocare (polypodium leucotomos fern extract)."
109,"Goodpasture syndrome is a rare but serious autoimmune disease that attacks the lungs and kidneys. The disease occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly produces antibodies against collagen in the lungs and kidneys. Collagen is a protein that helps form connective tissue. Goodpasture syndrome initially causes vague symptoms such as fatigue. But it can rapidly involve the lungs and kidneys. It is almost always fatal if it is not quickly diagnosed and treated. Researchers do not fully understand why the immune system attacks collagen in the lungs and kidneys. Goodpasture syndrome can run in families. So some researchers believe it may have a genetic component. Other factors that may increase the risk of Goodpasture syndrome include: Exposure to certain chemicals, such as hydrocarbon solvents and the weed killer paraquat Exposure to metallic dust Use of certain drugs, such as cocaine Tobacco smoking Viral infections Goodpasture syndrome usually affects young men. It more often occurs among whites, and it most commonly affects people who are: Between ages 20 and 30 Older than age 60 The first signs of Goodpasture syndrome may include: Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Difficulty breathing Pale skin Because Goodpasture syndrome may rapidly involve the lungs, initial symptoms such as shortness of breath can quickly progress to a persistent cough, sometimes with blood. When Goodpasture syndrome affects the kidneys, symptoms may include: Blood in the urine Foamy urine Swelling in the legs High blood pressure Burning or difficulty when urinating Back pain below the ribs Swelling of the hands and feet Although Goodpasture syndrome may cause life-threatening bleeding in the lungs, it usually does not result in long-term lung damage. The most serious consequence of Goodpasture syndrome is kidney failure, which may require either dialysis or a kidney transplant. See your doctor at once if you develop the characteristic symptoms of Goodpasture syndrome. He or she may order the following diagnostic tests: Urinalysis. High levels of protein and high numbers of red blood cells in urine may indicate kidney damage. Blood test. A blood sample can be analyzed for the presence of antibodies that attack the lungs and kidneys. Chest X-ray. Results can identify lung damage. For example, abnormal white patches are associated with lung bleeding. Biopsy. A small sample of kidney or lung tissue may need to be removed to check for the presence of Goodpasture syndrome antibodies. An analysis of kidney tissue can also identify the extent of any kidney damage. Goodpasture syndrome requires prompt and aggressive treatment in order to: Fight harmful antibodies Control fluid buildup Control high blood pressure Prevent serious lung and kidney damage Treatment usually includes oral immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. These drugs decrease the immune system's production of Goodpasture syndrome antibodies. In some cases, intravenous corticosteroids may be needed to control bleeding in the lungs. Depending on the patient's response to therapy, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs may continue for six to 12 months. Treatment of Goodpasture syndrome also usually includes a procedure called plasmapheresis. This helps remove harmful antibodies from the blood. During this procedure, about 300 milliliters of blood at a time are drawn from the body and placed in a centrifuge. The centrifuge separates the red and white blood cells from the plasma, the component that contains Goodpasture syndrome antibodies. Then the red and white blood cells are mixed into a plasma substitute and returned to the body. Usually, plasmapheresis is continued daily for several weeks. Goodpasture syndrome may last several weeks or as long as two years. Until the disease runs its course, some patients may need to be placed on supplemental oxygen or a ventilator. Other patients may require blood transfusions. Although kidney failure is a common complication of Goodpasture syndrome, less than 30% of surviving patients need long-term dialysis."
110,"Every organ and tissue in your body needs oxygen to work. Red blood cells are the transport system that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. When you have anemia, your body doesn't have enough of these blood cells. You get iron deficiency anemia when your body is low in iron. You need iron to make hemoglobin -- a protein that helps your red blood cells carry oxygen. Without enough oxygen in your blood, and you may feel tired, weak, and short of breath. Your doctor will find out why your iron is low. Usually, you can treat iron deficiency anemia with supplements. Once your iron levels increase, you should start to feel better. It can happen if you don't eat enough foods containing iron, your body can't properly absorb iron, you lose iron through your blood, or you're pregnant. Your diet is low in iron. How much iron you need depends on your age and gender. Men need at least 8 milligrams (mg) daily. Women ages 50 and younger need more -- 18 mg. Your body can't absorb iron. Iron from the foods you eat is absorbed in your small intestine. Conditions like celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease can make it harder for your intestines to absorb iron. Surgery such as gastric bypass that removes part of your intestines, and medicines used to lower stomach acid can also affect your body's ability to absorb iron. Blood loss. Some conditions can make you bleed inside your body, including: Peptic ulcer Hernia Uterine fibroids Colon polyps Women with heavy periods can become low in iron. Also, injuries and frequent blood donations can cause it. Pregnancy. When you're expecting, you need extra iron to nourish your growing baby. If you don't get enough iron from your diet or supplements, you can become deficient. Mild iron deficiency anemia often isn't noticeable. When it gets more severe, you may have these symptoms: Tiredness or weakness Pale or yellow skin Shortness of breath Dizziness Headaches Fast heartbeat Chest pain Cold feet and hands Brittle, cracked nails and hair loss Pica (cravings for things that aren't food, like dirt, starch, clay, or ice) Sore and swollen tongue Restless legs syndrome (an urge to move your legs while you're in bed) Because these can also be symptoms of other conditions, see your doctor to get a diagnosis. Your doctor will do one or more of these blood tests to find out if you have iron deficiency anemia. Complete blood count ( CBC). This test checks to see how many red blood cells you have. Peripheral blood smear. This test looks at the size and shape of your red blood cells. In iron deficiency anemia, red blood cells are smaller than usual. Hematocrit. This test shows how much of your blood is made up of red cells. Hemoglobin. This test shows the amount of this protein in your blood. If you have anemia, your hemoglobin will be low. Serum iron. This test shows how much iron is in your blood. Ferritin. This test shows how much iron is stored in your body by measuring this protein. Transferrin and total iron-binding capacity ( TIBC). These tests show how much of a protein called transferrin is free to carry iron through your body. Reticulocyte count. This test shows how many reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) you have in your blood. If you have iron deficiency anemia, your reticulocyte count is usually low because you're not making many new red blood cells. If blood tests show you have iron deficiency anemia, you might need other tests like these to see what's causing it. Endoscopy. Your doctor uses a tube with a camera on one end to look inside your esophagus or colon. Endoscopy can find bleeding in your GI tract from ulcers, polyps, or other growths. Pelvic ultrasound or uterine biopsy. If you bleed a lot during your monthly periods, this test can find the cause. Fecal occult blood test. This test looks for tiny amounts blood in your poop to check for cancer and other causes of bleeding in your intestines. You can treat iron deficiency anemia by taking iron supplements. Most people take 150 to 200 milligrams (mg) each day, but your doctor will recommend a dose based on your iron levels. Take vitamin C, too. It helps your body absorb the iron. You might need to take iron supplements for a few months or more to get your levels back up to normal. If your intestines don't absorb iron well, you can take iron straight into your bloodstream through an intravenous tube ( IV). But be warned: Iron supplements can cause constipation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, and dark poop. Your symptoms should start to go away after about a week. Your doctor will check your blood to see if your anemia has improved. You can also get more iron in your diet by eating more of these foods: Beef, pork, liver, chicken, turkey, duck, and shellfish Leafy greens such as broccoli, kale, turnip greens, and collard greens Peas, lima beans, black-eyed peas, and pinto beans Iron-enriched cereals and other grains Dried fruits, such as prunes and raisins If supplements don't help with your symptoms or your anemia is severe, you might need a transfusion of red blood cells. Or, if you have an ulcer, tumor, or other growth, it may need to be treated with medicines or surgery."
111,"Ameloblastoma is a rare kind of tumor that starts in your jaw, often near your wisdom teeth or molars. It's made from cells that form the enamel that protects your teeth. The tumor can cause pain or swelling and can change the look of your face. If it goes untreated for a long time, it may become cancerous and spread to your lymph nodes or lungs. Anyone can get one of these growths, but they're most often seen in adults ages 30 to 60. In the United States, between 300 and 600 cases are diagnosed every year. The tumors usually grow slowly over many months or even years. For a while, the only symptom may be swelling in the back of your jaw. You also might have tooth or jaw pain. Some people don't have any symptoms. It's found when they have an imaging scan done for some other reason. Occasionally, ameloblastomas grow quickly and painfully. This can uproot and move your teeth. They also can spread to your nose, eye socket, or skull. In rare cases, they can grow so large that they block your airway, make it difficult to open and close your mouth, or affect how your body takes in nutrients from food. Doctors aren't sure what causes ameloblastomas or why certain people get them. They do know they're more common in men than in women, and certain genes seem to play a role. An injury to your jaw or an infection in your mouth also might raise your risk. And scientists think some viruses or a lack of protein or minerals in your diet may be linked to them as well. Dentists often spot these tumors on X-rays -- they can look like soap bubbles on film. They also can be diagnosed with the following: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make images of your mouth. CT (computerized tomography) scan: Several X-rays are taken from different angles and put together to show more detailed information. Your doctor may want to take a small sample of tissue to look at under a microscope. To take the sample, he'll use a needle or make a small cut. This is called a biopsy, and it can confirm it's an ameloblastoma and help determine how fast it's growing. Drugs and radiation don't seem to have much effect on most non-cancerous ameloblastomas, so they're usually treated with surgery. To make sure the tumor cells don't grow back, your doctor will take out the tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it. Part of your jaw may need to be removed, as well as some of the arteries and nerves that affect your face. Your doctor will recommend surgery to re-create your jaw using bone from somewhere else in your body or artificial bone. You also may need rehabilitation to learn how to smile and chew again. After surgery, you'll have a CT scan to make sure the tumor is gone. You should have follow-up scans for the next 5 years or so to make sure it's not growing back. If a tumor does come back, it's more likely to become cancer. If it spreads to other parts of your body, radiation is usually recommended to slow or stop its growth. Scientists hope to find new treatments that can shrink these tumors without surgery. They're testing drugs that fight cancers linked to similar problem genes to see if they have the same effects on ameloblastomas."
112,"It's normal to sweat when you're nervous or hot, but if you're soaking through your shirt and socks at the end of each day, you may have a real medical problem called hyperhidrosis. Instead of trying to cover up heavy sweating, see your doctor. Excessive sweating isn't normal, and it's not something you have to live with. It can be treated. If you're embarrassed to talk about your problem or don't know how to begin the conversation with your doctor, here are a few tips to ensure that your first appointment is no sweat. How do you know that you have a problem with excessive sweating? Here are a few clues: You produce so much sweat that you soak through your shirt, pants, or socks You sweat even when it is cool outside or you aren't exercising You sweat at night, especially if you soak through your sheets You have other symptoms, such as chest pain or heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fever, or unintentional weight loss A number of different doctors treat hyperhidrosis. You can start by seeing your primary care doctor or call for an appointment with a dermatologist. When you go in for your first doctor's visit, it helps to know a little bit about your sweating patterns and what seems to trigger heavy sweating. In the days or weeks before your appointment, keep a diary of the following information: How many times a day do you have to change your clothes? How many times a day do you bathe or shower, and what type of soap do you use? What methods have you tried (such as antiperspirants or absorbent foot pads) to control excessive sweating? How has heavy sweating affected your life -- for example, have you had to change social plans, lost friends, or been affected at work because of hyperhidrosis? Do you experience any skin irritation at the site of the heavy sweating? How does heavy sweating affect you emotionally? Do you ever get sad or angry because of it? Your doctor will ask you about your sweating -- when it occurs, and what seems to trigger it. You'll also be asked about your medical history, including any medical conditions you have and medicines you are taking. The doctor will do a medical exam, which may include: Lab tests and other tests to check for conditions that can cause hyperhidrosis, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, and diabetes. Tests for hyperhidrosis. The starch-iodine test uses a mixture of iodine and starch, which turns blue in areas where your body is sweating excessively. The paper test uses a special type of paper applied to the affected area to measure the volume of sweat you are producing. Based on your health history and exam, your doctor will determine whether you have primary hyperhidrosis or secondary hyperhidrosis. Primary hyperhidrosis is the most common cause of excessive sweating. It's not due to any medical condition -- it is the condition. Primary hyperhidrosis tends to start in childhood and run in families, and it usually causes heavy sweating on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and armpits. Secondary hyperhidrosis is caused by a medical condition (such as cancer or an infection) or medication (which can include antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs). Sweating can occur over wider areas of your body. Knowing which kind of sweating problem you have can help your doctor find the right treatment for it. That treatment may involve antiperspirants, iontophoresis (a technique that uses a low current passed through water to treat heavy sweating of the hands and feet), or Botox injections to block the nerve signals that trigger your sweat glands. If sweating is due to another condition, then treating the primary condition may help with symptoms. Discuss all of your options with your doctor. Make sure you fully understand them, and their possible side effects, before you begin hyperhidrosis treatment. Also ask your doctor whether your health insurance will cover the cost of treatment. Some insurance companies and policies will pay for all or part of hyperhidrosis treatments, and it's important to know how much of your treatment you will need to cover yourself. Keep in close touch with your doctor while you are undergoing treatment for excessive sweating. If your hyperhidrosis isn't responding to antiperspirants, iontophoresis, or Botox, the next step may be to try oral medication or surgery."
113,"D-mannose is a simple sugar found in many fruits. It is related to glucose. It also occurs naturally in some cells in the human body. Other names for D-mannose are: Carubinose D-manosa Mannose Seminose D-mannose is used to treat a rare disease called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1b. This disease is passed down through families. It makes you lose protein through the intestines. Some reports say D-mannose slows down this protein loss and makes your liver work better. It may also reduce bleeding disorders and low blood sugar in people with this disease. Preliminary clinical trails in Europe show that D-mannose may also treat or prevent urinary tract infections ( UTIs). Research suggests the supplementstops certain bacteria from sticking to the bladder walls. Scientists think that the bacteria stick to the sugar instead. This helps the bacteria leave the body through your urine. Fewer bacteria in the bladder lowers your risk of a urinary tract infection. Some studies suggest D-mannose may play a useful role as a ""prebiotic."" Prebiotics are substances that may help your body by stimulating the growth of ""good"" bacteria in your digestive system. In some lab studies and studies in mice, D-mannose components were shown to increase the growth of ""good"" bacteria. This suggests D-mannose may have some use for people with dysbiosis, an imbalance in good and bad bacteria. D-mannose supplements are taken by mouth. D-mannose is found naturally in high amounts in many fruits. Such fruits include: Apples Oranges Peaches Some berries such as blueberries and cranberries D-mannose appears to be generally well tolerated in people. You should be cautious about using D-mannose if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, because there has not been enough study on its safety in these circumstances. Side effects of D-mannose may include: Bloating Loose stools D-mannose supplements should be used with caution if you have diabetes. It may make it harder to control your blood sugar. High doses of D-mannose may cause kidney damage. Always tell your doctor about any supplements you are taking, including natural ones and those bought without a prescription. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with any medications. Supplements are not regulated by the FDA."
114,"Perhaps the shaking began recently. Or maybe it's growing worse. It probably started gradually. It may have happened when you were stressed or angry. Or illness could have brought it on. Whatever the cause, âtremorâ is the name experts give to those shaky hands (and sometimes voice, head, mouth, and feet). They're more common than you might think, and the causes and outcomes can be quite varied. Essential Tremor is the most common tremor disorder. It usually starts in your hands, but it can move to your arms, head, voice, or other body parts. ET is different because it affects your hands when they're already moving. Most other forms of tremor take place when you're still. It could result from a gene (your doctor may call this a mutation). That means if one of your parents has a tremor, you're more likely to get one, too. Toxins in the environment cause some cases. But more research is needed to better understand the connections. Age is another risk factor. Although Essential Tremor can happen at any age, it's more likely in people over 40. Your odds go up as you get older. ET isn't life-threatening, but it can get more severe over time. Stress, fatigue, and too much caffeine can worsen it. At some point, eating, drinking, writing, and all the other daily tasks you do with your hands can become a bigger challenge. This condition can be hard to treat. There are medications, but none works consistently. Surgery is an option, as is a treatment called deep brain stimulation, in which doctors implant a device in your brain to help control the tremors. If shaky hands are a problem for you, ask your doctor if this might help. Learn more about deep brain stimulation to treat essential tremor. Tremor is an early sign of Parkinson's disease, which affects 10 million people worldwide. Not everyone who has this disease gets shaky, but most people in the early stages will have slight movement in a hand, foot, or even a single finger Most of the time, the tremor affects only one side of your body. Most often, it happens when you relax your muscles. That's why it's called a resting tremor. When you move, the shaking stops. Even a little flex of your fingers can help. As with other types of tremors, stress or excitement can make it worse. As you live with the disease, the tremor may spread from one side of your body to the other. Learn more about Parkinson's tremors. This disease, which targets your immune system, brain, nerves, and spinal cord, can also make your hands shake. You're most likely to have a tremor in your hand or foot. MS can cause a variety of tremors. The most common, like Essential Tremor, happens when you're already moving. Learn more about tremors with multiple sclerosis. Tremor is one of the first signs. If you weren't too hooked, the shakes may last just a few days. If you drank a lot, or for a long time, they can go on for a year or even longer. Learn more about alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Shaky hands don't always mean you're ill. Sometimes a tremor is your body's response to something: Drugs : The most common culprits are medications that block a brain chemical called dopamine. It moves information from one part of your brain to another. These drugs are used to keep your mood even. The tremors will go away when you stop taking the drugs. B12 deficiency: Without it, your nervous system won't work like it should. You can find it in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and milk products. If you're getting so little that your hands shake, your doctor will give you a shot. Caffeine: A cup of coffee or tea may cause your hands to shake. Stress: From financial and job worries to relationship problems and health concerns, stress worsens tremors. Intense anger, extreme hunger, or sleep deprivation can all make your hands shake. This is known as physiologic tremor. Low blood sugar: Your doctor will call this hypoglycemia. It triggers your body's natural stress response and makes you shaky. An overactive thyroid: This gland is in your neck, just above your collarbone. When it's in overdrive, your whole body speeds up. You may have trouble sleeping, your heart may beat faster, and your hands might shake. Nerve damage: Injury, disease, or a problem with your central nervous system can also cause tremors. Your doctor will call this peripheral neuropathy. It can affect your hands and feet. Because the causes and treatments vary widely for different types of tremors, it's important to talk with your doctor about your history and symptoms."
115,"Arthritis treatment may include physical therapy and/or occupational therapy. People with arthritis often have stiff joints -- largely because they avoid movements that can increase pain. By not moving arthritic joints, however, the stiffness and pain only get worse. Therefore, people with arthritis often benefit from physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you how to work out stiffness without further damaging your joint. Physical therapy also is useful after an injury, such as from a fall, and after joint surgery, especially for artificial joint replacement. Occupational therapy can teach you how to reduce strain on your joints during daily activities. Occupational therapists can show you how to modify your home and workplace environments to reduce motions that may aggravate arthritis. They also may provide splints for your hands or wrists, and recommend assistive devices to aid in tasks such as driving, bathing, dressing, housekeeping, and certain work activities. The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty. Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint. Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to use walking aids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary. If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: You gain education about your type of arthritis, so that you can be well informed. You gain foot-care advice, including information on well-fitting shoes with shock-absorbing outer soles and sculptured (orthotic) insoles molded exactly to the contour of each foot. You will learn therapeutic methods to relieve discomfort and improve performance through various physical techniques and activity modifications. You'll learn several techniques, including: Rest. Bed rest helps reduce both joint inflammation and pain, and is especially useful when multiple joints are affected and fatigue is a major problem. Individual joint rest is most helpful when arthritis involves one or only a few joints. Custom splints can be made to rest and support inflamed joints and a soft collar can support the neck while you are sitting or standing. Thermal modalities. Applying ice packs or heating pads, as well as deep heat provided by ultrasound and hot packs, can help relieve local pain. Heat also relaxes muscle spasm around inflamed joints. Heating joints and muscles with a warm bath or shower before exercising may help you exercise more easily. Exercise . Exercise is an important part of arthritis treatment that is most effective when done properly every day. Your doctor and therapist will prescribe a program for you that may vary as your needs change. Preoperative programs of education and exercise, started before joint replacement surgery, are continued at home. They may be changed in the hospital after surgery to fit new needs during the rehabilitation period. These exercises may be added to your usual exercise regimen, and you may find your ability to exercise has improved after surgery. There are ways to reduce the stress on joints affected by arthritis while participating in daily activities. Some of these include: Controlling your weight to avoid putting extra stress on weight-bearing joints such as the back, hips, knees, and feet. Being aware of body position, using good posture to protect your back and the joints of your legs and feet. When possible, sit down to do a job instead of standing. Change position often since staying in one position for a long time tends to increase stiffness and pain. Conserving energy by allowing for rest periods, both during the workday and during an activity. Respecting pain. It is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Don't try an activity that puts strain on joints that are already painful or stiff. An occupational therapist can show you ways to do everyday tasks without worsening pain or causing joint damage. Some joint protection techniques include: Using proper body mechanics for getting in and out of a car, chair or tub, as well as for lifting objects. Using your strongest joints and muscles to reduce the stress on smaller joints. For example, carrying a purse or briefcase with a shoulder strap rather than with your hand. Distributing pressure to minimize stress on any one joint. Lifting dishes with both palms rather than with your fingers and carrying heavy loads in your arms instead of with your hands. If your hands are affected by arthritis, avoid tight gripping, pinching, squeezing, and twisting. Ways to accomplish the same tasks with alternate methods or tools can usually be found. If you have arthritis, many assistive devices have been developed to make activities easier and less stressful for the joints and muscles. Your therapist can suggest devices that will be helpful for tasks you may find difficult at home or at work. A few examples of helpful devices include a bath stool for use in the shower or tub, grab bars around the toilet or tub, and long-handled shoehorns or sock grippers. Your therapist can show you catalogs that have a wide variety of assistive devices."
116,"If you have neck pain, you want to get rid of it as soon as you can. One of the ways to do that is through exercise. What should you do? More importantly, what shouldn't you do? As long as your doctor says it's OK, you should start as soon as possible to ease stiffness and pain. Resting for too long, usually anything more than a couple of days, will make it harder to get moving again. Don't exercise if you have severe neck pain or weakness in your hands or arms. If you get it while you exercise, stop right away and call your doctor. These simple ones can help: Neck Tilt: From the sitting position, tilt your head down so your chin touches your chest. Hold this position for 5 seconds. Return to the starting position and repeat. Do this five times. Side-to- Side Neck Tilt. From the same starting position, tilt you neck toward one shoulder, leading with your ear. Hold for 5 seconds and then return to the starting position. Do this five times on each side. Neck Turn. Look straight ahead, then turn your head to one side, keeping your chin at the same level. Do this five times on each side. Neck Stretch. Holding the rest of your body straight, push your chin forward, stretching your throat. Hold for 5 seconds. From the same starting position, push your chin backward and hold for 5 seconds. Do the forward and backward stretch five times each. If any of these exercises cause severe pain or weakness in your hands or arms, stop right away and talk with your doctor. Neck pain is common but usually not serious. Your pain should ease within 2 weeks. Full recovery should take 4-6 weeks. As your neck starts feeling better, you can do more of what you're used to. Even if the pain leaves, don't stop exercising. You should keep doing the moves for 6-8 weeks, even if you stop hurting. This will help keep your neck pain from coming back. You can work your neck muscles like any other muscles. Stretches work, but you can also do simple exercises like the ones below. They can improve your neck strength and your range of motion. With each of these exercises, start with five repetitions of each and see if you can build up to 10. Check with your doctor before you start. Rotations: Stand or sit with your back and your head squarely over your shoulders. Then, turn your head as far you can comfortably to one side. Hold it for up to 30 seconds. Then turn your head to the other side, and hold it for up to 30 seconds. Shoulder Circles: Standing, raise your shoulders straight up and move them in a circle one way. Lower your shoulder and repeat in the other direction. Resistance Exercises: Standing or sitting, put your left hand on the side of your head above your ear. Gently press your head against your hand while holding your head straight. Do the same thing with your right hand. Head Lifts. Lying on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, lift and lower your head. Make sure you don't raise your shoulders as you do this. You can also do these lying on your side and on your stomach. Core exercises can help with your neck pain. Your core is your abdomen, back, and buttocks. If your core is strong and you're holding your head upright as much as possible, your neck won't have to work as hard."
117,"Three of the more common skin conditions that people experience are blisters, corns, and calluses. Blisters: A blister is a bubble on the skin surface that often contains a clear liquid, although it may also contain blood or pus. Blisters can form when the skin is repeatedly rubbed; for instance, when your shoes rub the same spot on your foot, when you wear shoes that don't fit properly, or when you wear shoes without socks. Corn: A corn is a build-up of hard skin near a bony area of a toe or between toes. Corns may be caused by pressure from shoes that rub against the toes or cause friction between the toes. Callus: A callus is a build-up of hard skin, usually on the underside of the foot. Calluses are caused by an uneven distribution of weight, generally on the bottom of the forefoot or heel. Calluses also can be caused by improperly fitting shoes or by a skin abnormality. It's normal to have some calluses on the soles of your feet. Blisters The skin covering the blister helps protect it from infection. Your health care provider may recommend you ""pop"" the blister with a sterile needle to allow the skin to re-attach. However, don't cut the skin away unless it is already torn and drying out. Keep the blister clean. Gently wash the area with mild soap and water or a cleansing towel and then apply antibacterial cream to the blister. Cover it with gauze and secure it with hypoallergenic tape to help protect the skin and prevent infection. Change the dressing at least once a day and wear different shoes until the blister heals. Keep the wound covered with antibacterial ointment and a bandage until it is healed. Corns Don't try to cut the corn or remove it with a sharp object. After you take a bath or shower, while your skin is still soft, use a pumice stone or an emery board to smooth and gently remove the build-up of tissue. Move the emery board or pumice stone in one direction only. You can also use cushioned or medicated pads. Calluses Don't try to cut the callus or remove it with a sharp object. After your bath or shower, use a pumice stone to gently remove the build-up of tissue. You can use cushioned pads, donut pads and insoles to keep the pressure off the callus area. Your health care provider may prescribe medications to soften the calluses. To prevent blisters, corns, or calluses on the skin: Wear shoes that fit properly and comfortably Wear socks with shoes Use foot powder to help keep your feet dry Wear gloves when you are doing manual labor or working with your hands"
118,"When you feel like you're coming down with a cold, you don't need a crystal ball to figure out what's next. Sneezing and coughing, for sure. Maybe a headache, sore throat, or a runny nose. But for some folks, that's not all. Achy muscles can be a problem, too. Want some relief? You don't have to look much further than your neighborhood pharmacy. These are medications you can get without a prescription from a doctor. Some good choices for pain relief are acetaminophen or NSAIDs like aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs can lower your fever and ease muscle aches. Some people find that one medicine works better for them than another. Many OTC cold medicines have either acetaminophen or ibuprofen in them. NSAIDs work by cutting down how much your body makes of a hormone-like substance that causes pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen affects the areas of your brain that receive ""pain messages."" Many symptoms of these two illnesses are similar. But there are some key differences: A fever, headache, and other aches and pains are common with the flu but less so with colds. People who have colds usually have a stuffy nose and sore throat. That's less common when you have the flu. Flu symptoms often hit suddenly, which makes you weaker and weaker. A dry cough and fatigue can last 2 to 3 weeks. Some signs that your flu is getting worse include: A high fever Shaking chills Shortness of breath If you take them properly and follow the label instructions, OTC painkillers are safe for most people. But if you need pain relief for more than 10 days, talk to your doctor. Although they're usually safe, side effects can occur and may be quite serious for some people. For instance, if you use blood-thinning medicine or have active stomach or bowel ulcers, don't take aspirin or other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Children and teens with chickenpox, the flu, or a fever shouldn't take aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a potentially serious medical condition. And the FDA and drugmakers say that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines should not be given to children under age 4. Some doctors say that people with asthma should avoid aspirin because they get short of breath. NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen, may also cause stomach upset. They can also cause fluid buildup, leading to swelling (edema) as well as kidney and liver failure. People with asthma are at higher risk for serious allergic reactions to NSAIDs. These pain relievers can also increase blood pressure, especially if you already have high blood pressure. Acetaminophen is easier on the stomach than NSAIDs, but it can cause liver damage if you take more than it says on the instructions, particularly if you drink alcohol. You shouldn't take it if you already have liver disease or if you regularly drink moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol. Since combination cold medicines often have a pain reliever in them, usually acetaminophen or ibuprofen, be careful that you don't take another painkiller on top of that. Read the ingredients label to see which pain reliever is in your cold medicine. If it's one that's not safe to take with your medical condition, look for another. To be safe, talk with your doctor about any OTC drugs you're thinking of using."
119,"Also called a K-pouch, a continent ileostomy is a connection of the end of the small intestine, called the ileum, to the skin of your abdomen. A surgeon makes it so that waste can leave your body, because it can't leave the usual way. Unlike other ileostomies, the K-pouch has a valve that the surgeon makes. She sews the intestine in a special way so that waste material doesn't leak out. Instead, you insert a tube called a catheter when it's time to empty the pouch. As the pouch fills with what's in your intestines (such as liquids and partly digested food), pressure builds up on the pouch and its many stitches. Without relief, the pouch could tear or develop a hole, or the valve could slip or leak. How often to drain the pouch varies from person to person, but there are some general guidelines. Right after the operation, you will have what doctors call an indwelling catheter, meaning the surgeon will leave a tube in the pouch to drain continuously. This will last for about 3 to 4 weeks to allow the pouch to mature. After that, you will drain the pouch several times per day. The number of times you need to drain the pouch each day becomes less over time. Talk with your doctor, surgeon, or enterostomal therapist ( ET), a nurse who specializes in the care of stomas. Most likely, you will have met them before the operation. They can remind you of how to take care of your stoma, ostomy, or pouch. Constant drainage is best during the first 3 to 4 weeks for a new pouch. If the catheter or tube accidentally falls out before that time, you can put it back in with these simple steps: Relax your abdominal muscles. It may be helpful to bend your knee as you do that. Relubricate the catheter with water-soluble lubricant. Don't use Vaseline or other products containing petroleum jelly. Reinsert the catheter up to the preset mark. If you find this hard to do, relax, change positions and try again. During this initial period, you will need to irrigate the catheter several times a day with 1 ounce of tap water and let it drain off. If, at any time, you think pouch drainage has stopped, do these four things: Irrigate the catheter. Pinch the catheter between your finger and thumb and check to see if a fluid or air column is moving up and down. Check for fluid return. Wiggle the catheter in and out about an inch. If you still think pouch drainage has stopped, remove the catheter in case food particles or debris has blocked it. Flush the catheter with cool tap water, then reinsert it. After the first 3 to 4 weeks, you can stop the continuous draining and start draining several times per day, or as instructed by your health care provider. Though you usually make this change after seeing your doctor for the first time after the operation, sometimes your doctor will tell you to start doing the following earlier: Drain the pouch every 2 hours during the day while you are awake. Drain at bedtime and first thing in the morning. Don't drink or eat within 2 hours of bedtime. During the night, you will usually set the catheter to constant drainage. You may also set your alarm clock to wake you to empty the pouch. Over the next several weeks, you can wait longer between pouch drainages. At night, you may be able to stop the constant drainage and go for longer periods without needing to drain the pouch. Three months after surgery, there are usually no specific restrictions. You'll probably need to empty the pouch four to six times per day and use irrigation two of these times. But anytime you feel full or bloated, drain the pouch. And do it before you work out or go to bed. You'll need to keep the skin around the catheter clean and protected, and make sure the catheter is open and draining. First, gather these supplies: Washcloths or paper towels Soap that isn't oily Plastic bag or newspaper Dressing Irrigation supplies: tap water, bulb syringe, and basin Wash your hands with soap and warm water, and dry them with a clean towel. Irrigate the catheter. To do this: Remove the dressing over the stoma and throw it out. Separate the catheter from the drainage bag and drain the contents of the catheter into the basin. Collect 1 ounce of tap water into the bulb syringe. Tip: Mark this spot on the bulb syringe with permanent marker or nail polish for accurate, easy measurement. To insert the ounce of tap water into the catheter, slowly squeeze the bulb syringe to release the water. While you hold the syringe bulb down with your thumb, pinch the catheter and separate the bulb syringe from the catheter. Unpinch the catheter and drain its contents into the basin. Don't withdraw the fluid from the catheter into the syringe. If the fluid you just put in seems to take a long time to come back out, or if mucus blocks the catheter, irrigate again as needed until stool flows freely through the catheter. If water doesn't go in or come back out, the tube may be blocked. You may have to remove the catheter from the stoma and rinse it with cool tap water to clean any mucus built up inside the catheter. Then reinsert the catheter. Don't put in more than 2 ounces of water without the pouch contents emptying. When the stool flow has stopped, reconnect the catheter. Cleanse the skin around it and the stoma. Use a non-oily soap and warm water to do that. Rinse, and pat dry with a soft towel or paper towel. Put two layers of ""split"" dry gauze dressing around the catheter and over the stoma. Secure with tape as needed. Throw out the trash. Wash the basin and the bulb syringe with soap and warm water. Let the supplies air dry, or dry with a clean towel. Wash, rinse, and dry your hands. Check the catheter often to be sure drainage flows freely through the tube. Irrigate it twice a day, or as instructed by your ET nurse or doctor. You should also inspect your stoma daily. It should look shiny, moist, and red. If you see any changes, tell your doctor. If your stool becomes too thick and movement through the catheter slows down or has problems, you may need to drink more water, juice, or other beverages that don't have caffeine. Go for 10-12 glasses -- 8 ounces each -- per day. Never take laxative preparations. They can cause diarrhea and lead to dehydration."
120,"Endometriosis is a common and painful disease that affects about 5.5 million women in North America and is one of the top three causes of infertility in women. During a normal menstrual cycle, the lining of your uterus -- called the endometrium -- begins to thicken in preparation for becoming pregnant. If you don't become pregnant that month, your body sheds the endometrium during menstruation and the process starts over. In endometriosis, for reasons that researchers don't entirely understand, tissue very similar to the endometrium begins to grow outside the uterus in various places that it shouldn't. It can appear in or on the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the various structures that support the uterus, and the lining of the pelvic cavity. Sometimes, it's found in other places as well, including the cervix, vagina, rectum, bladder, bowel, and elsewhere. The problem is that this tissue behaves like normal endometrial tissue -- it builds up and breaks down with your menstrual cycle -- but it can't be shed like normal endometrial tissue during your period. As a result, the rogue tissue causes irritation and inflammation. This buildup of tissue can prevent the eggs from getting out of the ovaries or being fertilized by sperm. It can also scar and block the fallopian tubes, preventing the egg and sperm from meeting. In addition to fertility problems, some common signs and symptoms of endometriosis include: Pelvic pain Painful intercourse Painful urination Painful bowel movements Severe abdominal pain Lower back pain Heavy periods or spotting between periods Fatigue Some women with endometriosis do not have symptoms. Most women who have endometriosis can conceive normally. But if you're having problems getting pregnant, endometriosis may be the cause. To find out, your doctor may suggest a laparoscopy. In this procedure, a surgeon inserts a small camera through a tube into your abdomen to check for abnormal endometrial tissue. The surgeon might want to confirm the diagnosis with a biopsy. If you've been diagnosed with endometriosis, you have several treatment options, depending on the severity of the disease. Medication, either alone or in combination with surgery, can often decrease inflammation and reduce pain. If you and your doctor opt for surgery, the surgeon can attempt to remove as much of the diseased tissue as possible. In some women, surgery significantly improves their chances of getting pregnant. You should know, however, that pregnancy rates tend to be lower for women with severe endometriosis. Because some women with endometriosis have ovulation problems, another treatment option is the use of fertility drugs such as Clomid to induce ovulation. Injectable hormones also may be prescribed for the same reason. Once you begin to successfully ovulate, your doctor may suggest trying artificial insemination, in which sperm is inserted directly into your uterus. Keep in mind that some standard treatments for endometriosis can either prevent pregnancy or, in the case of the hormone Danocrine, cause serious birth defects. Make sure your doctor knows that you are trying to conceive if you're being treated for endometriosis. Problems with the fallopian tubes also account for a significant percentage of infertility cases. Sometimes, the tubes may be blocked or they may be scarred as a result of disease or infection. When an egg is released from one of the ovaries, it travels through one of the fallopian tubes, which are narrow ducts that connect the ovaries to the uterus. Normally, the egg will join with the sperm in the fallopian tubes during conception and the now-fertilized egg will continue on to the uterus. However, the fallopian tubes are extremely fragile. If they are blocked, there's no way for the egg to become fertilized by the sperm. The fallopian tubes can be damaged by diseases such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, infections and sexually transmitted diseases. To determine whether your fallopian tubes are blocked, your doctor may suggest a laparoscopy or a hysterosalpingogram ( HSG). In an HSG test, liquid dye is inserted by catheter through the vagina (cervix) into the uterus. Then, X-rays are taken to see if there is a blockage or if the dye flows freely into the abdomen. Another method of HSG uses saline and air rather than dye and ultrasound instead of X-ray. If you have problems with your fallopian tubes, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct the damage or unblock the tubes. If you're ovulating normally, your doctor might also consider assisted reproduction techniques that bypass the fallopian tubes entirely. These can include intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI), artificial insemination directly into the uterus ( IUI) and in vitro fertilization ( IVF)."
121,"When you get a proctoscopy, a doctor uses a special metal or plastic scope, called a proctoscope, to check the inside of your rectum. The rectum is the 8-inch muscular tube that connects your large intestine (colon) to the anus, the opening of the intestine that leads out of the body. There are several reasons. Your doctor may need to look for diseases of the rectum or anus, to check on abnormal results of a barium enema, or to look for causes of rectal bleeding. You may also get proctoscopy to track the growth of polyps (benign growths on the lining of the intestine) or to check for a return of rectal cancer if you've already had surgery for cancer. Before you get a proctoscopy, your doctor will usually ask you to use an enema (medication inserted into the rectum in order to cleanse the bowel) the night before the procedure. Ask for specific instructions. Or you may get an enema in the doctor's office just before the test. You'll probably get a proctoscopy in your doctor's office. You will remove your clothing below the waist and lie on your side on a table. The doctor will insert a gloved finger into your anus to check for tenderness or blockage. The doctor will then insert a lubricated proctoscope into your rectum and pump air in to expand the rectum. You may feel some fullness, like you need to pass a stool. Your doctor also may use special tools to remove growths or to take a sample of tissue -- called a biopsy -- for further testing. When the exam is over, your doctor will gently withdraw the scope. Most people don't need anesthesia for this procedure. You may feel some pressure or cramping while the scope is in place. But you should not feel any pain. It's not unusual to feel and hear some air escaping during this procedure. This is normal and expected, so don't be embarrassed. If you continue to have cramps after the procedure, passing gas may help. Walking around the room after the test may help you to pass the gas. The proctoscopy test usually takes from 5 to 15 minutes."
122,"Sulfa drugs can treat a range of health problems from eye infections to rheumatoid arthritis ( RA). But if you get a rash or more serious reaction when you take one of these drugs, you may have a sulfa allergy. Sulfa drugs, also called sulfonamides, include antibiotics and other types of drugs. Allergies happen most often with antibiotics. Around 3% of people have some type of reaction to them. Tell your doctor right away if you think you're having a reaction to a sulfa drug. She'll decide whether to take you off the drug and how to treat your symptoms. If you're allergic to sulfa drugs, or any other medication, you may have one or more of these symptoms: Skin rash or hives Itching Breathing problems Swelling The reaction can also cause these serious skin reactions: Sulfonamide drug hypersensitivity syndrome: Rash, fever, and organ problems begin within 1 to 2 weeks after you start the drug. Drug eruption: Red or swollen, rounded patches form in 30 minutes to 8 hours. Stevens Johnson syndrome: This potentially life-threatening reaction causes skin to blister and peel off. Other reactions to sulfa drugs include headache, trouble sleeping, cloudy urine (crystalluria), and low blood counts. Rarely, a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis happens. Sulfa antibiotics have been widely used for more than 70 years. In fact, the first antibiotic was a sulfa drug introduced in 1936. Today, these drugs include burn creams, vaginal suppositories, and eye drops as well as medications for many types of infections. If you've had an allergic reaction to one sulfa antibiotic, you're probably allergic to all of them. Here are a few examples of common sulfa drugs that could cause problems: Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ( Bactrim, Sulfatrim): a sulfa combination drug that can be taken in liquid or pill form for many types of infections Sulfacetamide ( BLEPH-10): drops for eye infections Sulfadiazine silver ( Silvadene): cream to prevent and treat burn infections Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine): pills for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease Even if you're allergic to antibiotics that have sulfa, you might be able to take some other types of sulfa drugs without a reaction. Ones that may be safe to take include: Glyburide ( Glynase, Diabeta), a drug for diabetes Celecoxib ( Celebrex), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine ( NSAID) Sumatriptan ( Imitrex, Sumavel Dosepro, Zecuirty), a migraine drug Water pills, or diuretics, including furosemide ( Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide ( Microzide) But be sure to tell your doctor if you have a sulfa allergy before taking any of these. A sulfa allergy sounds like a sulfite allergy, but they're very different. Sulfa drugs treat health conditions. Sulfites are preservatives used in many foods, drinks (especially wine), and medications. Sulfites can trigger asthma symptoms and on rare occasions can cause anaphylaxis. It's common for people who have asthma to be sensitive to sulfites. But it's unusual for other people. Sulfa drugs and sulfites are not related. Neither are their allergies. There's no need to give up dried fruit, wine, or other items that contain sulfites if you're sensitive to sulfa drugs."
123,"Your pelvis is the lower part of your belly, below your navel and between your hips. There are a lot of organs in this tight space -- your bladder, cervix, intestines, rectum, urethra, uterus, and vagina. Sometimes, the muscles and other kinds of tissue that hold everything in place get stretched out, weak, or torn. When that happens, some of your body parts can drop down below where they're supposed to be. Some of your body tissue can stick out of your vagina. This is called prolapse. It can affect all the organs in your pelvis. Nearly half of all women between ages 50 and 79 have at least a little bit of pelvic organ prolapse ( POP). It doesn't always cause symptoms, so you could actually have it and not know it. Men can get POP, too, if their bladders or rectums drop down. If you delivered a baby through your vagina (not by C-section), you have the biggest risk for POP. The more times you give birth, the higher your risk. But just because you've had babies, doesn't mean you're going to have a prolapse. Other things can raise your risk, like: Having surgery or radiation on your pelvic area Breaking your back or the bones in your pelvis Chronic constipation, because of the pushing and straining Chronic cough (it puts pressure on your pelvic organs) Obesity Doing a lot of heavy lifting over and over Getting older Having family members who have it Being white Having a hysterectomy Giving birth for the first time at a young age Smoking Pelvic organ prolapse is rarely life threatening. But it can cause a few problems, such as: Bladder control problems (urinary incontinence) A kink in the urethra, the tube that carries your urine outside your body. This can make it hard to pee. Bowel control problems (fecal incontinence), with liquid or solid stools coming out Problems having bowel movements when stools get trapped Pain during sex Urinary tract infections Kidney damage if it blocks your pee There are things you can to do tighten your pelvic muscles and reduce your risk. For instance, Kegel exercises can help strengthen the nerves and muscles in your pelvis. Making certain lifestyle changes might help, too. If you're overweight, for example, try to shed some pounds. Overweight women are more likely to get POP than those who maintain a healthy weight. Drink lots of fluids and eat high-fiber foods. This will help you to avoid constipation. Remember, constantly pushing and straining will only make the prolapse worse. Try not to lift anything heavy. If you must, learn to lift the right way --with your legs, not your back or abs. If you smoke, stop. Smoking increases your risk of POP. And see a doctor about any health issues you might have, like a cough that won't go away. Coughing puts pressure on your pelvic muscles and can make your prolapse worse."
124,"When you touch your breasts, do you notice that they feel lumpy or rope-like? Do they sometimes feel swollen or more tender to the touch, especially in the outer, upper parts? If so, you might have a very common condition doctors call âfibrocystic breast changes.â This term refers to two naturally occurring conditions in your breasts: fibrous tissue and benign (non-cancerous) cysts. â Fibrosisâ means you have a lot of breast tissue that's scar-like. It feels firm or rubbery. A cyst is a fluid-filled lump or sac that can move around in your breasts. If fluid builds up, it can stretch the surrounding tissue. It's not harmful, but it can hurt. Aside from a difference in the way your breast tissue feels, you might notice that: Changes are similar in both breasts Dark brown or green discharge leaks from your nipples Lumps change size during your menstrual cycle Pain or discomfort increases before your period Yes. About half of women in their 20s to 50s will have fibrocystic breast changes. It's rare after menopause, but it can happen if you're having hormone therapy. This means hormones like estrogen might play a part, since they affect breast tissue. But doctors aren't exactly sure what causes these changes. The condition used to be known as âfibrocystic breast disease.â But since it's a normal part of life for many women -- and not really a disease -- medical professionals now call them âchanges.â No. Fibrocystic breast changes aren't harmful. And your chances of getting cancer don't increase because you have them. But it can make it tricky to feel for new lumps or changes in your breasts when you do self-exams. That's why you really need to know what's normal for your breasts. When you notice something different, have your doctor check it out right away. Your doctor will first do a mammogram, or an ultrasound, if you're younger. She might be able to evaluate your breasts from the shape, density, and other signs from the images. If she needs more information to decide, she'll do a biopsy. This means getting a sample of your breast tissue. It's usually done in an office or clinic with a needle. Some women need surgery. The biopsy will show if a lump is a cyst or solid. It'll tell your doctor if the growth is cancerous. You usually won't need any -- unless your doctor finds it's cancer. If it's a cyst, your doctor can puncture and drain it. This can lessen pain and pressure, but the fluid can come back. Sometimes, cysts go away on their own. Some women find relief if they avoid caffeine. This is found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and sodas. Studies haven't proven a link, but if you have fibrocystic breasts, you might try cutting back to see if it helps. Your doctor may also recommend minor lifestyle changes to help your symptoms, such as: Cut salt from your diet to help reduce breast swelling at the end of your menstrual cycle. Take a diuretic, a drug that helps drain fluid from your body. Ask your doctor before taking any vitamin or herb supplements said to help symptoms. They can have side effects. Some doctors treat severe cases with prescription hormones like birth control pills or tamoxifen, a medication most often used to treat breast cancer. These can have serious side effects, too. Fibrocystic breast changes can be painful. Try these tips to ease discomfort: Avoid contact sports and activities that could impact your breasts Press heat or ice to painful areas Take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen Wear a good quality, supportive bra that fits well. Keep it on at night if needed."
125,"After you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise, your doctor probably started you on medication. If you're on just one medicine, it's probably metformin, a pill or liquid that cuts down how much glucose your liver makes. Even if you change your lifestyle and take your medicine as directed, your blood sugar may still get worse over time. That doesn't mean you've done something wrong. Diabetes is progressive, and many people eventually need more than one drug. When you take more than one drug to control your type 2 diabetes, that's called combination therapy. Diabetes medicines are divided into two types: insulin, and non-insulin. Most people with type 2 start with non-insulin ones. Non-insulin meds are split into six categories, based on how they work. They are: Metformin, which works in your liver Thiazolidinediones (or glitazones), which improve sugar removal from your blood Secretagogues, which help your pancreas make more insulin Starch blockers, which slow down how your body absorbs sugar from food Incretin-based therapies, which help your liver make less sugar and also slow how you absorb food. They can be pills or shots. Amylin analogs, injectable drugs that work much like incretin-based therapies. Some pills include two types of medication. These are called combination oral medicines. If one medicine isn't enough to control your type 2 diabetes, you and your doctor should work together to find the best mix for you. Usually, you'll keep taking metformin and add something else. What that is may depend on your situation. Some drugs control blood sugar spikes (your doctor may call this hyperglycemia) that come right after meals, for instance. Others are more effective at stopping drops in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) between meals. Some may help with weight loss or cholesterol, as well as your diabetes. The decision may also rest on whether you take medicine for something else. You and your doctor may also want to consider possible side effects. Cost may be an issue as well. You'll need to see your doctor more often when you start taking a new combination of drugs. You might find that adding a second drug doesn't bring your blood sugar under control. Or the combination of two drugs might work only for a short time. If that happens, your doctor might consider a third non-insulin drug, or you may start insulin therapy. You can't take insulin by mouth, because your stomach juices keep it from working properly. You might inject it using a syringe or a pen. Some people use an insulin pump. Insulin can be long-lasting or fast-release. Your doctor will decide what kind works best for you."
126,"What would you do if you cut your finger while chopping vegetables? How would handle a stovetop burn, a spider bite, or a child's scrape from a fall? Minor injuries happen every day, and most are easy to treat at home. But to handle them quickly and calmly, you need to know what to do and have the right supplies. How do I make a first aid kit? A well-stocked first aid kit is a must-have for treating minor injuries at home and on the go. You can buy a first aid kit or put one together on your own. Keep your supplies in a sturdy, clear plastic box so you can see what's inside. What should be in my first aid kit? Adhesive tape Alcohol wipes Allergy medicine Aloe vera gel Antibiotic ointment Bandages in different sizes Calamine lotion Cold packs Elastic bandages Gauze rolls and pads Hand sanitizer (for your travel first aid kit) Hydrocortisone cream Latex-free gloves Pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen Saline wound wash Scissors and tweezers Where should I store my first aid kit? You don't want to go searching for supplies when there's a minor accident to tend to. Your kit should be easy to find. But it should be kept in a high, childproof cabinet, far away from kids' prying fingers. Keep one full-sized kit in a central spot at home, such as your kitchen or bathroom. Then put a smaller kit in your car or purse for when you're on the road. How often should I check my first aid kit? Items can run out if you use them often, and medicines can expire if you rarely need them, so go through everything in your kit, and replace any empty or out-of-date items at least once a year. How do I treat a minor cut or scrape? Follow these steps to keep cuts clean and prevent infections and scars. Wash your hands. First, wash up with soap and water so you don't get bacteria into the cut and cause an infection. If you're on the go, use hand sanitizer. Stop the bleeding. Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few minutes. Clean the wound. Once you've stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don't get soap in the cut, because it can irritate the skin. And don't use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irritate the cut. Remove any dirt or debris. Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut. Do I need to bandage a cut or scrape? You don't need to bandage every cut and scrape. Some heal more quickly when left uncovered to stay dry. But if the cut is on a part of the body that might get dirty or rub against clothes, put on a bandage to protect it. Change the bandage every day or whenever it gets wet or dirty. How long should a cut or scrape be covered? Once a solid scab has formed, you can take off the bandage. When do I need to call my doctor? Check with your doctor or go to the emergency room if: The cut is deep, long, or the edges are jagged. You may need stitches and a tetanus shot. The cut or scrape is from a dirty or rusty object. You may need a tetanus shot. The injury is from an animal or human bite. You can't stop the bleeding with direct pressure. You can't get dirt out of the wound. The cut is on your face or near a joint, like on your fingers. The skin around the cut gets red and swollen or develops red streaks. Pus drains from the cut. You have a fever of more than 100.4 F (in either an adult or child). How do topical antibiotic ointments work? Topical antibiotics are medicines you put on your skin to kill bacteria. Most cuts and scrapes will heal without ointment, but they can reduce scars and help the wound heal faster. If you do use an antibiotic ointment, apply it to your skin one to three times a day and then cover with a clean bandage. When should I use gauze and tape? Gauze and tape work best for large cuts and scrapes that bandages won't cover. Ask your pharmacist which type of gauze is best for you. How should I apply gauze and tape? Wash your hands with soap and water. You can also wear gloves. Gently wash the wound with a wet piece of gauze or washcloth. Place a piece of clean gauze over the wound. Apply tape around the edges of the gauze to hold it in place. How do I prevent scars? When your body heals after a cut, scrape, or burn, sometimes a scar can be left behind. Depending on the injury, some scars are small, and others are bigger and more noticeable. To prevent scars, follow these tips: Wear helmets, kneepads, and other protective gear to avoid injury. Treat any cuts or other wounds right away. Keep the wound moist (try an antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly) while it heals. Don't pick at the scab. Consider covering your cut with silicone gel sheeting, a clear, sticky pad that can speed healing. If the scar isn't fading, ask your doctor about creams or ointments to make it less obvious. How do I treat a nosebleed? Nosebleeds usually look a lot worse than they are. Most of the time you can stop the flow with a few simple steps: Lean the head slightly forward, so blood doesn't run down the throat. With a tissue or washcloth, gently press the nostrils together to stop the bleeding. Hold the nose for at least 5 minutes. Then check to see if the bleeding has stopped. If it hasn't stopped, gently squeeze for another 10 minutes. Call the doctor or go to an emergency room if: The bleeding hasn't stopped after 15 to 20 minutes or keeps starting again. The bleeding is fast and there's a lot of blood. The bleeding is from an injury to your nose or face. You feel faint or weak. How do I remove a splinter? Splinters are more of an annoyance than real health problem, but if you've got one stuck in a finger or toe, you'll want to get it out. How you remove a splinter depends on how deep it is. If the splinter is sticking out of the skin: Wash the skin around the splinter with soap and water. Clean a pair of tweezers with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. Grab the end of the splinter with the tweezers. Pull it out at the same angle as the splinter went in. Clean the skin again with soap and water. If the splinter is under the skin: Wash the skin around the splinter with soap and water. Clean a needle and tweezers with alcohol. Gently scrape away the skin above the splinter with the needle until you can see the top of the splinter. Grab the end of the splinter with the tweezers and pull it out at the same angle it went in. Clean the skin again with soap and water. How do I treat animal bites and scratches? Sometimes a seemingly friendly dog or cat can bite or scratch. If you or your child gets a bite, follow these steps to treat the wound: Hold a towel or gauze to the area to stop the bleeding. Clean the wound with soap and water. Cover it with a clean bandage or gauze pad. When should I see a doctor for an animal bite? For any animal bite, you may need an antibiotic to prevent infection. So it's always a good idea to call your doctor, especially if you have medical conditions that weaken your immune system. Also, you should call your doctor or head to the emergency room if: The bite was caused by an animal you don't know, or by any wild animal like a raccoon, skunk, or bat. You may need a tetanus or rabies vaccine. The bite is large, or it doesn't stop bleeding after you've held pressure on it for 15 minutes. It may need to be closed with stitches. You think the bite may have damaged a bone, tendons, or nerves, because you can't bend or straighten the body part or you've lost feeling in it. The wound is red, swollen, or oozing fluid. How do I treat bee, wasp, and other insect stings? Here's what to do: If the insect has left behind a stinger, remove it from the skin so less of the venom gets into your body. You can scrape out the stinger with the edge of a credit card or the dull edge of a knife. Don't squeeze the stinger. You might release more of the venom into your skin. Once the stinger is out or if there is no stinger, wash the area around the sting with soap and water. Hold an ice pack or cool washcloth to the sting to stop it from swelling. Spread calamine lotion or baking soda mixed with water to relieve pain. To prevent itching, use a spray or cream containing hydrocortisone or antihistamine. How do I treat a mosquito bite? Here's what to do: Apply firm pressure to the bite for 10 seconds to help stop the itch. Use a baking soda paste or hydrocortisone cream 4 times a day to relieve itching. Don't have either on hand? Holding ice or a wet washcloth on the bite will also help. Take an antihistamine if the bite is very itchy. What are the signs that my child is allergic to the insect? It's normal for the skin around the insect sting to swell up and get red. But call 911 or go to the emergency room if you see any of these signs of an allergic reaction: Dizziness Hives -- red, itchy bumps on the skin Stomach cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea Swelling of the tongue Trouble breathing, wheezing Anyone who has allergies to bees, wasps, or other stinging insects should keep an epinephrine auto-injector at home, work, and school in case of a sting. How do I treat a spider bite? For most of the harmless types of spiders you'll find at home, treatment is pretty simple: Wash the area with soap and water. Hold an ice pack or cool washcloth to the bite to relieve pain and bring down swelling. How do I know if a spider is poisonous? Spiders might be creepy and crawly, but most of them aren't poisonous. The poisonous spiders to watch out for are the brown recluse and black widow. Here's how to spot them: Brown recluse spiders are about 1/2-inch long. They're brown and have a mark in the shape of a violin on their back. Black widow spiders are black with a red hourglass-shaped mark on their stomach. What should I do for a poisonous spider bite? If you think you were bitten by a poisonous spider like a brown recluse or black widow, call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Look for these signs: A red or purple color around the bite Pain in the bite area Swelling around the bite Muscle pain and cramps Fever Chills Rash Stomach pain Nausea and vomiting Trouble breathing What are the different types of burns? Grabbing a hot pot or splashing boiling water on your skin are just two common causes of burns around the house. When you get a burn, first check to see which type it is. Some are more serious than others. First-degree burns are painful but minor. They turn red and may swell. Second-degree burns form blisters. The skin may be very red and painful. Third-degree burns make the skin look white or charred. The burns may not hurt because nerves have been damaged. When should I see a doctor? Serious burns need to be treated by a doctor or in a hospital. Call for medical help if: You have a third-degree burn. The burn is larger than 2 to 3 inches. The burn is on your face, hands, feet, or over a joint like your shoulder or knee. The burn goes all the way around a hand, arm, foot, or leg. The pain gets worse instead of better. The burn was caused by electricity or a chemical. You see fluid or pus oozing from the burn. How do I treat burns? You can treat minor first-degree burns and small second-degree burns at home. Here's what to do: Place the burned area under running cool water for at least 5 minutes to reduce swelling. Apply an antiseptic spray, antibiotic ointment, or aloe vera cream to soothe the area. Loosely wrap a gauze bandage around the burn. To relieve pain, take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Never put butter on a burn or pop any blisters that form. You could damage the skin and cause an infection. How do I treat a sunburn? Always wear sunscreen when you're outdoors to protect your skin from the sun. If you stay outside for too long without protection, you can get a red, itchy burn that may blister. As soon as you spot a sunburn, head inside to treat it. Soothe your burned skin with a cool, damp washcloth. Or take a cool shower or bath. Pat your skin dry afterward. Be gentle -- your sunburn may be sore. Apply an aloe vera lotion. Or use a hydrocortisone cream to relieve the itch. Do not use lotions that contain petroleum, benzocaine, or lidocaine. These ingredients can irritate the skin even more. If the sunburn is really sore, take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen to relieve the pain. A sunburn can dry out your body. Drink extra water so you won't get dehydrated. Give your sunburn time to heal. Cover your burned skin with clothing and a hat to protect it when you go outside. See a doctor if you have blisters on the sunburn, or you get a fever or chills. Don't pop the blisters. They could get infected. How do I treat a rash from poison ivy or other poisonous plants? When you touch poison ivy -- or poison oak or sumac -- the rash that appears on your skin is caused by an oil in the plant. The rash may itch and blister. But it should go away on its own within a few weeks. Treat the rash and itch at home with these steps: Wash your skin. To get as much of the oil off as possible, clean your skin with soap and lukewarm water. Wash everything. Clean anything the plant touched -- your clothes, gardening tools, even your pet. The oil can stick to these objects and cause a rash if you touch them again. Bathe in oatmeal. Run a warm bath and add some colloidal oatmeal or baking soda to ease the itch. You can also apply a cool, wet washcloth to your skin. Apply calamine or hydrocortisone cream. These products will also relieve the itch. If creams and lotions aren't enough to soothe itchy skin, ask your doctor whether you should take an antihistamine or steroid medicine by mouth. Don't scratch! Though the rash might itch, resist the urge to scratch or pick at the blisters. You could get an infection. When should I get medical help for poison ivy, oak, or sumac? Go to the emergency room if you have: Trouble breathing or swallowing Rashes or blisters on a large part of your body, or on your face or genitals Swelling, especially of the eyes An itch you can't relieve, no matter what medicine or lotion you use A fever over 100 F A rash that hasn't gone away after a few weeks What's the difference between a sprain and strain? Sprains and strains are common injuries. Here's how to tell the difference: A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough tissue that connects bones and supports the joints. You're most likely to get a sprain in the wrist or ankle. Sprains cause pain, bruising, and swelling. You may have trouble moving the joint. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, the thick tissue that attaches muscles to bones. You're most likely to get a strain in your back or hamstring muscles. Strains cause pain, weakness, swelling, and muscle cramps. You may have trouble moving the muscle. How do I treat sprains and strains? For a mild sprain or strain: Rest the limb to give it a chance to heal. Hold ice on the area for 20 minutes at a time, four to eight times a day, to bring down swelling. Don't use heat -- it could make the area swell even more. Wrap an elastic bandage or splint around the sprain or strain. Put a pillow under the injured body part to keep it raised. Take over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen to relieve the pain. For a more severe sprain or strain, where there's a lot of pain, swelling, and you have trouble moving around, see your doctor. You may need crutches or physical therapy. Emergencies Call 911 for any medical emergency, including when a person has: Chest pain A serious allergic reaction Bleeding that won't stop Trouble breathing What should I do when I call 911? Tell the operator: The type of emergency The telephone number you're calling from The address where the emergency is happening Details about the person's condition -- what happened to them, the type of injuries they have, and what has been done so far to treat them The 911 operator might tell you step by step how to help the person who has been injured. DO NOT HANG UP until the operator hangs up. How can I prepare for an emergency? Keep a fully stocked first-aid kit in your home and car. Have up-to-date copies of each person's medical history in your home and car. Post an emergency contact sheet next to each phone in the house. Show it to everyone who spends time in your home, including family members and babysitters. Make sure your children know what number to dial -- 911 -- and what they should tell the operator. Emergency Contact Sheet FOR AN EMERGENCY: DIAL 911 Poison Control Center: 800-222-1222 Police: Fire: Hospital name: Phone: Doctor's name: Phone: Dentist's name: Phone: Pharmacy name: Phone: Health insurance plan: Policy number: Phone: Emergency Contact 1 Name: Relationship: Phone: Emergency Contact 2 Name: Relationship: Phone: Family contact information Home phone: Address: Parent name: Cell number: Work number: Medical Conditions: Allergies/ Other info: Parent name: Cell number: Work number: Medical Conditions: Allergies/ Other info: Child's name: Child's date of birth: Medical Conditions: Allergies/ Other info: Child's name: Child's date of birth: Medical Conditions: Allergies/ Other info: Child's name: Child's date of birth: Medical Conditions: Allergies/ Other info:"
127,"Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) is a common, and very contagious, virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children before their second birthday. For most babies and young children, the infection causes nothing more than a cold. But for a small percentage, infection with RSV can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening problems such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways of the lungs. RSV infection can cause cold-like symptoms, including a cough and runny nose, which usually last 1 to 2 weeks. When to see a doctor: Call your baby's doctor if you notice any of the following RSV symptoms: A high-pitched whistling or wheezing noise when they breathe Being unusually upset or inactive A cough with yellow, green, or gray mucus Trouble breathing or pauses in their breaths Refusing to breastfeed or bottle-feed Signs of dehydration: lack of tears when crying, little or no urine in their diaper for 6 hours, and cool, dry skin If your baby is very tired, breathes rapidly, or has a blue tint to their lips or fingernails, call 911 or go to the ER immediately. Respiratory syncytial virus spreads through the air, like after a cough or a sneeze, and through direct contact like touching. The chance of a severe infection is highest for: Babies born prematurely Children younger than 2 who were born with heart or lung disease Infants and young children whose immune systems are weakened because of illness or medical treatment Children under 8 to 10 weeks old To diagnose RSV, your child's doctor will probably look at their medical history and do a physical exam, including listening to their lungs. Your doctor might do some tests if your child is very sick or in order to rule out other problems. Tests for RSV include: Blood and urine tests to look for a bacterial infection and make sure your child isn't dehydrated Chest X-rays to look for any signs of pneumonia Tests of material scraped out of your child's nose or mouth Steps you can take to try to avoid and prevent RSV include: Avoid kissing your baby if you have cold symptoms. Clean and disinfect hard surfaces. Don't let anyone smoke around your baby. If possible, keep your baby away from anyone, including siblings, with cold symptoms. Keep your baby away from crowds. Ask people to wash their hands before they touch your baby. Limit the time high-risk babies and young children stay in day care, particularly from late fall to early spring, when RSV is most common. Wash your hands often, especially after contact with anyone who has cold symptoms. There's no vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus. But a medication called palivizumab may prevent RSV infections and protect high-risk babies from serious complications of RSV infection. If your baby is at high risk, your doctor may give them a monthly shot of it during peak RSV season. Although palivizumab may help prevent serious complications of RSV infection, doctors don't use it to treat RSV. No medication treats the virus itself. So caring for a baby with RSV infection involves treating the symptoms and how it affects your baby's respiratory system. Most babies and young children can be cared for at home: Remove sticky nasal fluids with a bulb syringe and saline drops. Use a cool-mist vaporizer to keep the air moist and make breathing easier. Give your little one fluids in small amounts throughout the day. Use non-aspirin fever-reducers such as acetaminophen. Check the label and follow all directions carefully. Babies with more serious cases may need to go to a hospital, where their treatment may include: Oxygen IV fluids Medications to open their airways"
128,"You have a terrible headache. How do you know if it's something serious? Some of the symptoms of a migraine can be very much like those of a stroke. If you think there's even the slightest chance you're having a stroke, call 911 right away. Early treatment can limit the damage to your brain and possibly save your life. If you're over 40 and have never had a migraine, assume your pain is something more serious. People who get migraine typically have it most of their lives. It's rare to have your first symptoms when you're older. If you get migraine and your aura symptoms or headaches seem different than what you've typically experienced,, get checked out. Most people with migraine have similar symptoms each time. During a stroke, blood flow to part of your brain is cut off. Cells there don't get enough oxygen and start to die. There can be two causes. Either a blood vessel is blocked, for instance with a blood clot, or a blood vessel tears or bursts and causes bleeding in or around the brain. A sudden severe headache can be a sign of a stroke. Other common symptoms are: Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of your body Trouble speaking or trouble understanding others Vision problems in one or both eyes Sudden dizziness or loss of balance or coordination Confusion The kind of stroke that tends to be mistaken for a migraine is called a transient ischemic attack, or TIA. It's also known as a ""mini stroke"" because blood flow to your brain is cut off only for a short time. Symptoms are less severe than with a regular stroke and may last less than an hour. Migraine is a disease that causes recurrent attacks of head pain together with other symptoms such as a bad headache that often comes with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch. The pain may throb or pulse, and you usually feel it on one side of your head around your eye or temple. A migraine with aura is the kind that can be confused with a stroke. An aura affects your senses and usually happens before the headache. You may see light flashes, zig-zagged lines, or blind spots, or you might feel tingling or numbness in your arms, legs, or face. You might have ringing in your ears or trouble speaking. Sometimes, you'll have those symptoms but never get a headache. That tends to happen more often as you get older. It can be hard to tell the difference between a migraine with aura and a TIA. Here's what to look for: With a stroke, symptoms usually come on suddenly. With a migraine, they happen gradually; the headache usually starts small and gets more painful. A stroke is more likely to have what are called ""negative"" symptoms such as you might lose sight in one eye or lose feeling in one of your hands or feet. A migraine is more likely to have ""positive"" symptoms. That means added sensations, like flashes in your vision or tingling in your skin. If you're young, it's more likely to be a migraine. If you're older, it's more likely to be a stroke, especially if you've never had a migraine before or you have high blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat. Doctors aren't sure exactly how migraine and strokes are linked. They do know that people who get migraine with aura are about twice as likely to have a stroke as people who don't get migraine at all. The risk goes way up if you're also a young woman who smokes and takes birth control pills. A migraine without aura don't seem to affect your chances of having a stroke. But they may make you more likely to have other heart-related problems. One theory about the connection has to do with damage to the cells that line the blood vessels. Some research has found that a migraine can cause inflammation inside your arteries. That can make them stiff and cause your blood to clot more easily. Both of those increase your chances of a stroke. It's possible to have a stroke while you're having a migraine, but that doesn't mean the migraine caused the stroke. A stroke can trigger migraine symptoms, including the aura. Certain medications for migraine headaches, including ergot alkaloids and triptans, can narrow your arteries. If you've had a stroke, you shouldn't take those. In general, medicines and lifestyle changes (like quitting smoking) that lower your risk of a stroke may also keep you from having migraine."
129,"Hypnosis -- or hypnotherapy -- uses guided relaxation, intense concentration, and focused attention to achieve a heightened state of awareness that is sometimes called a trance. The person's attention is so focused while in this state that anything going on around the person is temporarily blocked out or ignored. In this naturally occurring state, a person may focus his or her attention -- with the help of a trained therapist -- on specific thoughts or tasks. Hypnosis is usually considered an aid to psychotherapy (counseling or therapy), because the hypnotic state allows people to explore painful thoughts, feelings, and memories they might have hidden from their conscious minds. In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain. Hypnosis can be used in two ways, as suggestion therapy or for patient analysis. Suggestion therapy: The hypnotic state makes the person better able to respond to suggestions. Therefore, hypnotherapy can help some people change certain behaviors, such as stopping smoking or nail biting. It can also help people change perceptions and sensations, and is particularly useful in treating pain. Analysis: This approach uses the relaxed state to explore a possible psychological root cause of a disorder or symptom, such as a traumatic past event that a person has hidden in his or her unconscious memory. Once the trauma is revealed, it can be addressed in psychotherapy. The hypnotic state allows a person to be more open to discussion and suggestion. It can improve the success of other treatments for many conditions, including: Phobias, fears, and anxiety Sleep disorders Depression Stress Post-trauma anxiety Grief and loss Hypnosis also might be used to help with pain control and to overcome habits, such as smoking or overeating. It also might be helpful for people whose symptoms are severe or who need crisis management. Hypnosis might not be appropriate for a person who has psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, or for someone who is using drugs or alcohol. It should be used for pain control only after a doctor has evaluated the person for any physical disorder that might require medical or surgical treatment. Hypnosis also may be a less effective form of therapy than other more traditional treatments, such as medication, for psychiatric disorders. Some therapists use hypnosis to recover possibly repressed memories they believe are linked to the person's mental disorder. However, the quality and reliability of information recalled by the patient under hypnosis is not always reliable. Additionally, hypnosis can pose a risk of creating false memories -- usually as a result of unintended suggestions or the asking of leading questions by the therapist. For these reasons, hypnosis is no longer considered a common or mainstream part of most forms of psychotherapy. Also, the use of hypnosis for certain mental disorders in which patients may be highly susceptible to suggestion, such as dissociative disorders, remains especially controversial. Hypnosis is not a dangerous procedure. It is not mind control or brainwashing. A therapist cannot make a person do something embarrassing or that the person doesn't want to do. The greatest risk, as discussed above, is that false memories can potentially be created and that it may be less effective than pursuing other, more established and traditional psychiatric treatments. Hypnosis is performed by a licensed or certified mental health professional who is specially trained in this technique."
130,"If your doctor suspects sarcoidosis, he or she will do the following: Review your medical history Perform a physical exam Order chest X-rays and blood tests that may aid in the diagnosis In 90% of people with sarcoidosis, chest X-rays show abnormalities. Bloodwork cannot be used to diagnose sarcoidosis, but you may see a low white count (5% - 10%), high calcium in the blood or urine, and elevated ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) levels and inflammatory markers. Your doctor may also order pulmonary-function tests, which measure how well your lungs are working. To be sure about the diagnosis, your doctor will likely recommend a tissue biopsy. She will be looking for non-necrotizing granulomas (nodular inflammation with immune cells), or other diseases, which which may resemble sarcoidosis on a chest X-ray. Many people with sarcoidosis have mild symptoms and do not require any treatment. Often, the disease gets better on its own. However, for patients with more pronounced symptoms, corticosteroid drugs, such as prednisone, or other immunosuppressive medications, are the recommended therapy. The main goals of treatment are to keep the patient comfortable by reducing symptoms and reducing inflammation, which may maintain proper functioning of any affected organs. At this time, there is no treatment available to reverse the pulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs) that may accompany severe sarcoidosis. There is no known way to prevent sarcoidosis."
131,"Your doctor has medicines to treat the red, painful bumps that come from blocked hair follicles causing hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS). A few home remedies can also help clear your skin and prevent new breakouts. Relief for the bumps could be as simple as making a few changes in your life or to your daily routine. Here are some things to try. Lose extra weight. Sometimes it works even better than medicine for clearing up blocked hair follicles. You don't have to lose a lot to see a difference. Trim just 10% of your body weight. Quit smoking. Another reason to kick the habit. Smoking doesn't cause blocked hair follicles, but it can irritate your skin. When you quit, you'll probably notice fewer flare-ups. Wear loose clothes. Bumps often form in areas where your skin rubs together, such as your armpits or between your buttocks. Tight clothes cause even more friction and irritation. Wear loose-fitting ones, including underwear, to ease pressure on the bumps. Natural fabrics such as cotton are better than man-made ones like polyester and nylon. Stay cool. Blocked hair follicles can flare up when you get overheated or you sweat. If the bumps are under your arms, use an antiperspirant to stay dry. Just be careful which kind you choose. Some have chemicals that irritate your skin even more. Ask your doctor to recommend a gentle, scent-free product. Don't shave. Shaving under your arms or anywhere else you have bumps can trigger breakouts. Your doctor can suggest a gentler way to remove hair. Take care of yourself. Eat a balanced diet, get enough sleep, exercise, and avoid stress to help prevent flare-ups. Ask about supplements. Scientists have done a few studies on how supplements like zinc, vitamin B12, copper, and niacinamide (vitamin B3) affect HS. Zinc might help the condition, but researchers need more evidence to know for sure. Talk to your doctor before you take any vitamin or supplement to make sure it's safe. Keep the area clean. Blocked sweat glands can get infected if you have bacteria on your skin. Try these ways to avoid infections: Clean yourself with an antibacterial wash. Or try an acne treatment to cut the amount of bacteria on your skin. Take a bleach bath. Mix about 1/2 cup of bleach into the tub water. Soak your body (but not your head) for 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse off with warm water and pat your skin dry. If your bumps get irritated and sore, try these things to feel better: Wet a washcloth in hot water. Hold this warm compress to the area for 10 minutes to bring down swelling. Or, seep a tea bag in hot water and hold it on the area for 10 minutes. If the sores are on your buttocks, try a sitz bath. Run a few inches of warm water in the tub. Sit in the water for 10 to 15 minutes. Take an over-the-counter NSAID pain reliever, such as ibuprofen. They should be just one part of your treatment. Your doctor will also prescribe medicines to clear up breakouts and prevent new ones. Call your doctor if your treatment doesn't work and the bumps still bother you."
132,"There are four stages of syphilis. What symptoms you have depends on which stage of the disease you're in. But the stages can overlap, and symptoms don't always develop in the same order. You could even be infected with this sexually transmitted disease ( STD) and not have any signs of it for years. But even if you don't have symptoms, you can still pass it on to your sexual partner. If you think you have it or have been exposed to syphilis, get treated right away. The stages of syphilis are called âprimary,â âsecondary,â âlatent,â and âtertiary (late).â This article deals with the symptoms typical of each stage. Symptoms for the first stage normally appear 10 days to 3 months after you're exposed to syphilis. You might notice that the lymph nodes near your groin are enlarged. Typically, the first visible sign of syphilis is a small, painless sore (doctors call it a âchancreâ) on the skin (you may develop several sores). It normally appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. The sore won't hurt, and it may be hidden inside your rectum or vagina. You might not even know you have it. The sore will heal on its own in about 3 to 6 weeks. But this doesn't mean the infection is gone. It means you're about to enter the second stage of syphilis. About 2 to 10 weeks after the first sore appears, you may develop the following: A skin rash that causes small, reddish-brown sores Sores in your mouth, vagina, or anus Fever Swollen glands Weight loss Hair loss Headache Extreme tiredness (fatigue) Muscle aches If you don't get treatment right away, your symptoms will go away only to come back. This could happen for up to a year. Even if your symptoms don't return, the infection is still alive in your body. Syphilis will get worse, and you can still infect your sexual partner. If you're not treated for secondary syphilis, the disease may progress to the latent (hidden) phase. Not everyone who has syphilis will go through this stage. If you do, you won't have any symptoms, maybe for years. In some cases, symptoms will never return. But the infection isn't gone; the bacteria remain dormant in the body. Some latent cases may progress to the tertiary stage of the disease. This is the final, most severe stage of syphilis. It can appear 10 to 30 years after the initial infection. You might experience permanent organ damage and death. Complications may include: Brain (neurological) problems Stroke Infection and inflammation of membranes around the brain and spinal cord Numbness Deafness Visual problems or blindness Personality changes Dementia Heart valve disease Aneurysm Inflammation of blood vessels You can pass this STD on to your unborn child or to your baby during childbirth. Doctors call this congenital syphilis. If not treated there is a high risk of stillbirth and infant death. Most babies born with syphilis have no symptoms. Some may have a rash on the palms of their hands or the soles of their feet. Eventually, babies can develop complications of many organs including: Enlarged liver Jaundice Discharge from nose Swollen glands Bone abnormalities Brain (neurological) problems See your child's pediatrician right away if she develops an unusual discharge, sore, or rash near her groin."
133,"Purring is the most common sound cats make. Yet we know less about it than meowing, chirping, chattering, hissing, and growling. Yes, cats purr when they're content. When yours is curled up in the sun, you may hear a gentle rumble as he breathes in and out. Touch him, and you feel a little quiver. It's almost as if he's sending out waves of calm. But you shouldn't assume that sound means your cat is in a good mood. Or that it's the only time you'll hear it. Cats purr to communicate other emotions and needs, too. What if you pick your cat up and hold him? Does he purr because he likes it -- or because he's nervous? Although you'll never know exactly what yours is saying when he purrs, research from animal experts, along with considering the situation, lets you make an informed guess. Your cat looks relaxed: Perhaps she's on her back, eyes half-closed, tail mostly still. If she's purring, it's safe to assume she's in her happy place. That noise is a big smile. Some cats purr when it's mealtime. British researchers studied the sounds that house cats make when they're hungry and when food isn't on their minds. The purrs don't sound the same. When cats purr for food, they combine their normal purr with an unpleasant cry or mew, a bit like a human baby's cry. Experts believe that we're more likely to respond to this sound. They've found that people can tell the difference between the purrs, even if they aren't cat owners. Kittens can purr when they're only a few days old. It's probably a way to let their mothers know where they are or that they're OK. Purring also helps a kitten bond with its mother. Mama cats use it like a lullaby. Even though purring takes energy, many cats purr when they get hurt or are in pain. So what makes the effort worth it? It might simply be a way for a cat to soothe itself, like a child sucks their thumb to feel better. But some research suggests that purring actually helps cats get better faster. The low frequency of purrs causes a series of related vibrations within their body that can: Heal bones and wounds Build muscle and repair tendons Ease breathing Lessen pain and swelling This might explain why cats are able to survive falls from high places and tend to have fewer complications after surgeries than dogs."
134,"Female hormones and migraine headaches are linked. That's one of the reasons why women are three times more likely to get migraines than men. For many women, menopause brings a welcome end to these headaches. But the hormonal changes leading up to menopause can sometimes make things worse before they get better. Still, no matter when in life you have migraines, the right treatment can help prevent the headaches or make the pain go away. People who get migraines describe them as an intense pulsing or throbbing type of pain, often on one side of the head. Along with the pain they can also have symptoms like: Flashing lights or ""aura"" Nausea Sensitivity to light Vomiting When you have one, you may be unable to do your normal activities. Many people get migraines from time to time. But some, usually women, have them as often as 15 or more days each month. These headaches are triggered by things like: Bright lights Foods or drinks Hunger Lack of sleep Stress Strong scents A drop in the female hormone, estrogen, can also set off migraines. That's why women who get migraines often have headaches right before their period, when estrogen levels are low. During pregnancy, estrogen levels rise, bringing many women a break from these headaches. But they often start up again after the baby is born. As you get closer to menopause, your hormone levels can swing up and down, and your periods may get more irregular. If your migraines are tied to your menstrual cycle, they may become as unpredictable as your periods. Some women get migraines for the first time, or their headaches get more intense, in the years just before menopause. Others find that their migraines become less frequent and less intense. Women who had their uterus and ovaries removed with surgery often have more of a problem with migraines than those who go into menopause naturally. You have many options for relieving migraines. Sometimes a few simple lifestyle changes can help: Keep a diary of what you eat, and try to avoid foods that trigger your migraines. Some of these may include: aged cheese, chocolate, or artificial sweeteners. Eat meals at regular times. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Cut stress using relaxation methods such as deep breathing, exercise, or massage. You can also try medicines to relieve your headaches. Migraine drugs fall into two categories. Medicines that help prevent migraines from starting: Antidepressants: venlafaxine ( Effexor), amitriptyline ( Elavil) Anti-seizure drugs: divalproex sodium ( Depakote), topiramate ( Topamax), valproate sodium ( Depacon), valproic acid ( Depakene and Stavzor) Blood pressure medicines: beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers CGRP inhibitors: erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy), block the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide molecules Medicines that relieve a migraine once it has already started: Pain relievers: acetaminophen ( Panadol, Tylenol), aspirin, ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil), naproxen ( Aleve) Triptans: eletriptan ( Relpax), frovatriptan ( Frova), rizatriptan ( Maxalt), sumatriptan ( Alsuma, Imitrex, Treximet), zolmitriptan ( Zomig) For some women, taking the same female hormones used to treat menopause symptoms like hot flashes can also help prevent migraine pain. But hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) doesn't work for everyone. And some women find that the hormones make their headaches worse. HRT has been linked to greater risks of heart disease and breast cancer. Talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you. If so, ask for the lowest possible dose of hormones needed to control your symptoms. You can get the hormones through a patch or gel that you rub on your skin. Once estrogen production stops and periods end, you may get a reprieve from your migraine pain. Sometimes, though, menopause doesn't spell the end of migraines. If you can't take medication or wish not to, a device might be worth considering. Cefaly is a portable headband-like device gives electrical impulses on the skin at the forehead. This stimulates a nerve associated with migraine headaches. Cefaly is used once a day for 20 minutes, and when it's on you may feel a tingling or massaging sensation. Spring TM may be another option. You hold it at the back of your head at the first sign of a headache, and it gives off a magnetic pulse that stimulates part of the brain. In addition, there is a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator called gamma Core. When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain. If you're getting regular migraines before, during, or after menopause, talk to your doctor. Together you can find a treatment that helps prevent or relieve your headache pain."
135,"If you get an aneurysm, it means you have a bulge in the wall of an artery. It happens when the pressure of blood passing through has forced a weakened part of the artery to balloon outward. Aneurysms can happen in any blood vessel, but they usually form in the belly or chest portions of your aorta -- the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart -- or in arteries that nourish your brain. Aneurysms there are serious, while those in other areas, such as your leg, are often less hazardous. The most serious threat of an aneurysm is that it will burst and cause a stroke or massive bleeding, which can be life-threatening. A large aneurysm can affect your circulation and lead to blood clots. It's important to get it diagnosed and treated early. Aneurysms often have mild symptoms or none at all, so routine exams can help your doctor check for warning signs. Aortic aneurysm . As the name suggests, this type happens in your aorta. It can be linked with hardening of the arteries, also known as atherosclerosis. It may be an inherited condition or a complication of high blood pressure or smoking. Cerebral aneurysm. Also known as a berry aneurysm, you get this kind in the wall of a blood vessel in your brain. Smoking raises your risk of getting one. Ventricular aneurysm. This is a bulge in the wall of your heart. A previous heart attack is the most common cause. In rare cases, a severe chest injury can also lead to it. Any condition that causes your artery walls to weaken can bring one on. The most common culprits are atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. Deep wounds and infections can also lead to an aneurysm. Or you may be born with weakness in one of your artery walls."
136,"It's easy to measure your waist. And it's not just about your clothing size. Your waist circumference is a clue to whether you're at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease. And all you need is a tape measure. Start at the top of your hip bone, then bring the tape measure all the way around your body, level with your belly button. Make sure it's not too tight and that it's straight, even at the back. Don't hold your breath while measuring. Check the number on the tape measure right after you exhale. For your best health, your waist should be less than 40 inches around for men, and less than 35 inches for women. If it's larger than that, you may want to talk with your doctor about what your next steps are, including losing weight. You can't spot-reduce your waist, or any other part of your body. Crunches will strengthen your abs, but to lose inches around your waist, it will probably mean eating fewer calories and burning more off through exercise."
137,"Antidepressants are some of the best treatments we have for depression. But these drugs don't cure depression in the way that antibiotics cure infections. Instead, they can help ease the symptoms. You will probably need to continue medication even after you feel better. The American Psychiatric Association recommends that people keep taking their medicine for four to five months after they recover from a first episode of depression and often longer (sometimes even indefinitely) for people who have had multiple previous depressions. This helps reduce the risk of relapse. Depression can sometimes be like other chronic illnesses, like diabetes or heart disease, that need ongoing treatment. This is called maintenance treatment. Here is a rundown of some of the most common medicines used to treat depression and prevent it from coming back. Newer Antidepressants. In the past two decades, many new types of antidepressants have become available, each working in slightly different ways: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) affect the activity of a chemical in your brain called serotonin. This class of antidepressants include citalopram ( Celexa), escitalopram ( Lexapro ), fluoxetine ( Prozac ), fluvoxamine ( Luvox), paroxetine ( Paxil), sertraline ( Zoloft). vilazodone ( Viibryd) and vortioxetine ( Trintellix, former called Brintellix) are newer medicines that bind to the serotonin reuptake receptor (the same one as with SSRIs as well as other types of serotonin receptors that may have unique effects. Side effects of most SSRIs are generally mild. They include stomach upset, sexual problems, insomnia, dizziness, weight change, and headaches. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) affect the action of both serotonin and another brain chemical, norepinephrine. This class includes desvenlafaxine ( Khedezla or Pristiq), duloxetine ( Cymbalta), levomilnacipran ( Fetzima), and or venlafaxine ( Effexor). Side effects are usually mild. They include upset stomach, sleep problems, sexual problems, headache, anxiety, and dizziness, and weakness. Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors ( NDRIs) affect norepinephrine and a different chemical in the brain, dopamine. This class of drugs includes bupropion ( Wellbutrin). Side effects are usually mild, and include upset stomach, headache, sleep problems, tremor, and anxiety. Wellbutrin may be less likely to cause sexual side effects or weight gain than other antidepressants. You cannot take this medication if you have had seizures before. Noradnergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants ( Na SSAs) also affect serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain. This class of drugs includes mirtazpine ( Remeron). Side effects are usually mild, and include upset stomach, sleepiness, weight gain, anxiety, and dizziness. Older Antidepressants Some of the first medicines used to treat depression were tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs). Both types affect the availability of certain neurotransmitters (chemicals in the brain) that are thought to play a role in depression. While these medicines can be very effective in some forms of depression, doctors usually no longer use them as first-line treatments because of concerns about side effects. They can have more severe safety risks due to certain drug or food interactions and also can be very dangerous in overdose. However, they are still the right choice for some people with depression -- especially if newer antidepressants don't help. Other Medicines Other drugs that are not actually antidepressants can also help. For instance, some people recovering from depression will benefit from drugs for anxiety or insomnia. In addition, certain atypical antipsychotics -- (primarily used for schizophrenia or bibolar disorder) such as aripiprazole ( Abilify), brexipipzole ( Rexulti) or ( Seroquel XR) -- have been shown to enhance the effect of antidepressant medicines for depression when an antidepressant alone isn't fully effective. While not classified as a medication by the FDA, l-methylfolate ( Deplin) has proven successful in treating depression. Considered a medical food or nutriceutical, it is a prescription strength form of the vitamin B known asfolate and helps regulate the neurotransmitters that control moods. It has been effective in treating treatment resistant depression. Unfortunately, finding the right medicine and the right dose isn't always simple. People have very different reactions to these drugs. There's no way for your doctor to predict how well a medicine will work for you. You may even find that a medicine that used to help just doesn't anymore. You may have to put up with some trial and error. While antidepressants usually begin to show significant effects within a few weeks, it can take several months before you feel the full effects of a new drug, so don't give up. Over time, your doctor may want to increase or decrease the dose, depending on how you're doing. If you've given a depression drug a chance and it still isn't helping, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you try another antidepressant. With time, you should be able to find a medicine or a combination of medicines that helps. Don't ever stop taking a medicine without your doctor's approval, even if you're feeling better. Stopping a medicine suddenly can trigger a relapse or, with some antidepressants, flu-like symptoms and nausea or dizziness caused by sudden discontinuation of the drug. Your doctor will want you to check in on a regular basis, especially soon after starting a new medicine, to see how you're doing and monitor the effects of medication. Take advantage of these appointments to talk about any issues you have with your medication."
138,"Genital herpes can be a confusing disease. Symptoms can look like other conditions, or there may be no symptoms at all. How can you to tell if you have it? These questions and answers will help. Unless no one has ever kissed you, and unless you've never had sex, it is possible that you've picked up a herpes virus. Oral herpes, usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1), shows up as cold sores or fever blisters on the mouth. Even a casual peck on the lips from someone with a cold sore can give you the virus. That's why it's so common: As many as 50% to 80% of adults in the U. S. have oral herpes. Genital herpes, most often caused by the second type of herpes virus ( HSV-2), is less common, but plenty of people still have it. Roughly one in five U. S. adults has genital herpes. But up to 90% of those who have it don't know they are infected. You could be one of them. Often, it's hard to tell by looking. The textbook symptom of genital herpes is a cluster of small fluid-filled blisters that break, forming painful sores that crust and heal during several days. Affected areas include the penis, scrotum, vagina, vulva, urethra, anus, thighs, and buttocks. But many people don't get these sores. Some people have no symptoms at all, while others get symptoms that can be easily mistaken for razor burn, pimples, bug bites, jock itch, hemorrhoids, an ingrown hair, or a vaginal yeast infection. After you're infected, the symptoms go away, but can flare up from time to time. Luckily, the first outbreak usually is the worst. And some people may have just one or two outbreaks in their lifetime. Yes. A doctor can take a sample from what appears to be a herpes sore and send it to a lab to be examined. You can also have a blood test. The blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. HSV-2 almost always infects the genitals, so if antibodies to HSV-2 are detected in the blood, you probably have genital herpes. A blood test that shows antibodies to HSV-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. That's because oral herpes, typically caused by HSV-1, can be spread to the genitals during oral sex. The only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. Short of that, a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. Remember, you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. Likewise, you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. If you know that a sex partner has genital herpes, you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. Nevertheless, genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms, so you should always use a latex barrier, such as a condom or a dental dam. If your partner has a known history of herpes, the rate of transmission can be decreased by having your partner on a daily prophylactic (preventative) dose of antiviral herpes medication like acyclovir. Your partner's doctor can prescribe this. Studies are under way to investigate medicated gel products that can be placed in the vagina to reduce the transmission of herpes and HIV. These may be available in the near future. Genital herpes is rarely life threatening. But having herpes sores makes it easier for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter the body. Not only is there an increased risk for getting HIV if you have genital herpes, but having the two diseases together may also make each one worse. A pregnant woman can pass genital herpes on to her baby, so it's particularly serious during pregnancy. If you get infected near the end of pregnancy, the risk is highest. At least 30% and as many as 50% of newly infected pregnant women give the virus to their babies. For moms who were infected long before delivery, the risk is much lower. Less than 1% of babies born to mothers with an older genital herpes infection get the virus. And if a woman has an outbreak at delivery, a cesarean section ( C-section) is usually done. Genital herpes is a lifelong condition for which there is no cure. Having it can force you to make inconvenient changes in life, particularly in your sex life, and it can cause you a lot of pain and discomfort. You simply would rather not have it."

The head or glans is at the end of the shaft. The opening at the tip of the head, where urine and semen come out, is called the meatus. Inside, two cylinder-shaped chambers called the corpora cavernosa run the length of the penis. They have a maze of blood vessels, tissue, and open pockets. The urethra, the tube that urine and semen flow through, runs along the underside of them, in the spongy tissue of the corpus spongiosum. Two main arteries (one in each of the corpora cavernosa) and several veins move blood in and out. Nerves relay messages to and from other parts of your body. An erection starts in your brain. Something you saw, felt, smelled, heard, or thought makes your nerves send chemical messages to the blood vessels in your penis. The arteries relax and open up to let more blood to flow in; at the same time, the veins close up. Once blood is in the penis, pressure traps it within the corpora cavernosa. Your penis expands and holds the erection. When the inflow of blood stops and the veins open, your penis becomes soft. When you're aroused, tubes called the vas deferens squeeze sperm from the testes toward the back of the urethra. The seminal vesicles also release fluid there. The urethra senses the sperm and fluid mixture. Then, at the height of sexual excitement, it sends signals to your spinal cord, which in turn sends signals to the muscles at the base of your penis. These contract powerfully and quickly, every 0.8 seconds. This forces the semen out of the penis as you climax."
140,"The liver continuously filters blood that circulates through the body, converting nutrients and drugs absorbed from the digestive tract into ready-to-use chemicals. The liver performs many other important functions, such as removing toxins and other chemical waste products from the blood and readying them for excretion. Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver. Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic, meaning it started elsewhere in the body. Primary liver cancer, which starts in the liver, accounts for about 2% of cancers in the U. S., but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries. This is mainly due to the prevalence of hepatitis, caused by contagious viruses, that predisposes a person to liver cancer. In the U. S., primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women, at an average age of 67. Because the liver is made up of several different types of cells, several types of tumors can form there. Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. The outlook for health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have. The more common benign tumors of the liver include: Hemangioma Hepatic adenoma Focal nodular hyperplasia Cysts Lipoma Fibroma Leiomyoma None of these tumors are treated like liver cancer. They may need to be removed surgically if they cause pain or bleeding. Liver cancers include: Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) Cholangiocarcinoma ( These are really cancers of the bile duct. They will not be discussed in this article.) This article discusses hepatocellular carcinoma. It's important to know what type of liver tumor you have. Be sure to get that information from your health care provider. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by birth defects, alcohol abuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis. More than half of all people diagnosed with primary liver cancer have cirrhosis -- a scarring condition of the liver commonly caused by alcohol abuse. Hepatitis B and C and hemochromatosis can cause permanent damage and liver failure. Liver cancer may also be linked to obesity and fatty liver disease. Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Aflatoxins, cancer-causing substances made by a type of plant mold, have also been implicated. Aflatoxins can contaminate wheat, peanuts, rice, corn, and soybeans. These are rare problems in most developed countries like the U. S. Other causes include the hormones androgen and estrogen and a dye formerly used in medical tests called thorotrast. Other risk factors for liver cancer may include: Your sex. Men are more likely to get hepatocellular carcinoma than women. Your weight. Obesity can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Your race. In the U. S., liver cancer is most common in Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Anabolic steroid use. Male hormonesabused by athletes to increase muscle can slightly increase liver cancer risk with long-term use. History of diabetes. Studies have suggested a link between diabetes and liver cancer. This is likely due to the link between diabetes and fatty liver disease. Inherited metabolic diseases. Diseases that disrupt the normal metabolism of the body have been shown to increase your risk of liver cancer. Rare diseases. Studies have found a link between liver cancer and some rare diseases like alpha -1-antitrypsin deficiency, tyrosinemia, and Wilson's disease."
141,"A fracture is the medical term for a broken bone. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Fractures are common; the average person has two during a lifetime. They occur when the physical force exerted on the bone is stronger than the bone itself. Your risk of fracture depends, in part, on your age. Broken bones are very common in childhood, although children's fractures are generally less complicated than fractures in adults. As you age, your bones become more brittle and you are more likely to suffer fractures from falls that would not occur when you were young. There are many types of fractures, but the main categories are displaced, non-displaced, open, and closed. Displaced and non-displaced fractures refer to the alignment of the fractured bone. In a displaced fracture, the bone snaps into two or more parts and moves so that the two ends are not lined up straight. If the bone is in many pieces, it is called a comminuted fracture. In a non-displaced fracture, the bone cracks either part or all of the way through, but does move and maintains its proper alignment. A closed fracture is when the bone breaks but there is no puncture or open wound in the skin. An open fracture is one in which the bone breaks through the skin; it may then recede back into the wound and not be visible through the skin. This is an important difference from a closed fracture because with an open fracture there is a risk of a deep bone infection. Because of the unique properties of their bones, there are some defined fracture subtypes that present only in children. For example: A greenstick fracture in which the bone is bent, but not broken all the way through A buckle fracture results from compression of two bones driven into each other. A growth plate fracture at the joint that can result in shorter bone length These fracture subtypes can present in children and adults: A comminuted fracture is when the bone breaks into several pieces A transverse fracture is when the fracture line is perpendicular to the shaft (long part) of the bone. An oblique fracture is when the break is on an angle through the bone A pathologic fracture is caused by a disease that weakens the bone A stress fracture is a hairline crack The severity of a fracture depends upon the fracture subtype and location. Serious fractures can have dangerous complications if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or surrounding tissue. Recuperation time varies depending on the age and health of the patient and the type of fracture. A minor fracture in a child may heal within a few weeks; a serious fracture in an older person may take months to heal."
142,"It's important to treat your RA early to prevent damage to your joints. It's best to see a doctor who knows rheumatoid arthritis inside and out, even if your condition is mild. Ideally, you should see a rheumatologist -- a specialist in arthritis. If you can't see a rheumatologist for all your RA care, look for one who will partner with your regular doctor. You'll still need to see the rheumatologist once in a while, but your primary care doctor may handle your day-to-day treatment. If it's not possible to see a rheumatologist at all, look for a primary care doctor who treats many people with RA and ask if they can work with a rheumatologist remotely. It's simple: You need to be able to tell your doctor what's going on, and she should be able to communicate clearly to support you. Your doctor should also help you better understand your RA, what to expect from treatment, and what complementary treatments might help or hurt your condition. To make the best match, think about: The office staff. Are they considerate and helpful? Do they return your calls promptly? Because your time with your doctor may be limited, find out if your doctor works with other people who can help answer some of your questions. Access. Can you get an appointment on short notice if you have an RA flare? How soon will the doctor return your calls or reply to your emails? If your doctor doesn't have all the traits you'd like, tell them how you feel and ask for what you need. If you're still unhappy, look for another doctor. Check with organizations like the Arthritis Foundation or American College of Rheumatology for names of rheumatologists in your area. Ask your primary care doctor or friends. Key things to know about your doctor include: Are they part of a group, or do they work on their own? Can I see the doctor of my choice in the practice, or must I see the first available doctor? How long is the average wait for an appointment? Does the office offer evening or weekend appointments? Once you narrow your list, make appointments to talk with each of your top choices. It will take some time and effort, but it's worth it to find a doctor who's a good fit for you."
143,"If you just missed one, take it as soon as you remember. If you don't remember until the next day, go ahead and take 2 pills that day. If you forget to take your pills for 2 days, take 2 pills the day you remember and 2 pills the next day. You will then be back on schedule. If you miss more than 2 birth control pills, call your doctor for instructions. You may need to take one pill daily until Sunday and then start a new pack. Or you might need to throw out the rest of the pill pack and start over with a new pack that same day. Any time you forget to take a pill, you must use another form of birth control until you finish the pill pack. When you forget to take a birth control pill, you increase the chance of releasing an egg from your ovary. But if you forget to take any of the last 7 (or last 4 of a 4-pill placebo pack or last 2 of a 2-pill placebo pack) out of the 28 day pills, you will not raise your chance of pregnancy, because these pills contain only inactive ingredients. Some pill packs don't have any placebo pills, so it's best to take all of your pills on schedule so you can stay on track. If you miss your period and have forgotten to take one or more pills, get a pregnancy test. Many women do not have a period on low-dose birth control pills even if they don't miss any pills. This is normal, so don't be concerned -- but do take the test to be sure."
144,"If your child has allergic asthma and inhales one of his triggers, that can launch an attack, making him cough, wheeze, and have trouble breathing. It's best to know what your child's triggers are so you can help him avoid them altogether or at least keep them far, far away. Each person has their own set of asthma triggers, but there are some common ones you can watch for. These tiny critters are one of the most common triggers of allergic asthma. They survive on the dead skin flakes that all humans shed naturally. They hide in sheets, mattresses, pillows, blankets, stuffed toys, carpets, curtains, and upholstered furniture. There's not much you can do about shedding dead skin, but you can work to keep dust mites from bothering your family. Wash any bed linens that you can at least once a week in hot water, then put them in a hot dryer. Wash stuffed toys the same way. There are also special covers for mattresses and pillows. If you can, trade in carpets, rugs, and fabric furniture for wood, vinyl, and other smooth surfaces. These pests are everywhere but are most common in cities and in southern U. S. states. They eat and drink the same things you do: water and leftovers. But they (and their droppings) can trigger asthma flares. To prevent them, keep food stored in the fridge or in an airtight container, wash dishes right after you use them, sweep up any crumbs, and plug any holes or cracks that let cockroaches get inside. You can also set out traps. If you see any roach droppings, sweep them up right away and put them in the trash. And keep a lid on your trash can inside and take it out often. It's both an indoor and outdoor trigger for allergic asthma. Outside, it thrives in soil and plant debris, which doesn't really pose a health problem. Inside, mold is a hazard, lurking in damp places like basements, the kitchen sink, and anywhere you have leaks or standing water. Your best defense is to get rid of as much moisture as possible from your home. Clean up any mold you can see, use exhaust fans when you're in the shower, and run a dehumidifier or air conditioner. A drier house will also cut down on roaches and mites. Cats, dogs, hamsters, birds, and other furry and feathered friends can also be asthma triggers. But the fur and feathers aren't the problem. It's the animals' dander, urine, and saliva. If you don't have a pet, it's best not to get one. If you do, try to keep her out of your child's bedroom and off of upholstered furniture and carpets. It's also a good idea to bathe the pet at least once a week and vacuum or sweep regularly. Pollen allergies depend on where you live and the time of the year. For instance, pollen from trees tends to be a problem in the spring, while grass is a problem in the summer, and fall means weeds. ( Climate change also means that pollen seasons can last longer than they used to.) Thunderstorms can also cause plants to release their pollen. Keep an eye on local weather forecasts and pollen counts, and have your child stay indoors on days when the counts are high. There are a million good reasons to keep yourself and your child away from tobacco smoke, and allergic asthma is one of them. Secondhand smoke is extra toxic to young children because their lungs aren't mature yet. Make sure no one smokes in your home or your car. Other types of smoke, such as from wood-burning stoves, can also make asthma worse. If you can, avoid wood fires, inside and outside. Many household products give off scents that can trigger an asthma attack. This includes cleaning agents with chlorine, scented candles, incense, hairspray, air fresheners, deodorants and perfumes, paint, and pesticides. Look for fragrance-free personal care products. If you need to use paint or pesticides, make sure your child is not nearby."

But you don't have to be an athlete or even a ""weekend warrior"" to turn your ankle and hurt it. Something as simple as walking on an uneven surface can cause a painful, debilitating sprain. Ankle injuries can happen to anyone at any age. However, men between 15 and 24 years old have higher rates of ankle sprain, compared to women older than age 30 who have higher rates than men. Half of all ankle sprains occur during an athletic activity. Every day in the U. S., 25,000 people sprain their ankle. And more than 1 million people visit emergency rooms each year because of ankle injuries. The most common ankle injuries are sprains and fractures, which involve ligaments and bones in the ankle. But you can also tear or strain a tendon. Sprains, Strains, and Fractures Ankle injuries are defined by the kind of tissue -- bone, ligament, or tendon -- that's damaged. The ankle is where three bones meet -- the tibia and fibula of your lower leg with the talus of your foot. These bones are held together at the ankle joint by ligaments, which are strong elastic bands of connective tissue that keep the bones in place while allowing normal ankle motion. Tendons attach muscles to the bones to do the work of making the ankle and foot move, and help keep the joints stable. A fracture describes a break in one or more of the bones. A sprain is the term that describes damage to ligaments when they are stretched beyond their normal range of motion. A ligament sprain can range from many microscopic tears in the fibers that comprise the ligament to a complete tear or rupture. A strain refers to damage to muscles and tendons as a result of being pulled or stretched too far. Muscle and tendon strains are more common in the legs and lower back. In the ankle, there are two tendons that are often strained. These are the peroneal tendons, and they stabilize and protect the ankle. They can become inflamed as a result of overuse or trauma. Acute tendon tears result from a sudden trauma or force. The inflammation of a tendon is called tendinitis. Microscopic tendon tears that accumulate over time, because of being repeatedly over stretched, and don't heal properly lead to a condition called tendinosis. Tendons can also rupture. Subluxation refers to a tendon that slips out of place. An ankle injury occurs when the ankle joint is twisted too far out of its normal position. Most ankle injuries occur either during sports activities or while walking on an uneven surface that forces the foot and ankle into an unnatural position. The unnatural position of the ankle in high-heeled shoes or walking in unstable, loose-fitting clogs or sandals is also a factor that may contribute to ankle injuries. In addition to wearing faulty footwear, an ankle injury can happen as a result of: Tripping or falling Landing awkwardly after a jump Walking or running on uneven surfaces A sudden impact such as a car crash Twisting or rotating the ankle Rolling the ankle The symptoms of a sprain and of a fracture are very similar. In fact, fractures can sometimes be mistaken for sprains. That's why it's important to have an ankle injury evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. The signs include: Pain, often sudden and severe Swelling Bruising Inability to walk or bear weight on the injured joint With a sprain, the ankle may also be stiff. With a fracture the area will be tender to the touch, and the ankle may also look deformed or out of place. If the sprain is mild, the swelling and pain may be slight. But with a severe sprain, there is much swelling and the pain is typically intense. Tendinitis and acute tears of the peroneal tendon result in both pain and swelling. In addition, the ankle area will feel warm to the touch with tendinitis. With an acute tear, there will be a weakness or instability of the foot and ankle. Tendinosis may take years to develop. Symptoms include: Sporadic pain on the outside of the ankle Weakness or instability in the ankle An increase in the height of the foot's arch With the subluxation you will notice ankle instability or weakness. You also may notice sporadic pain behind the outside ankle bone and a ""snapping"" feeling around the ankle bone. You can apply first aid for an ankle injury by remembering R. I. C. E: rest, ice, compression, elevation. Rest. It's important to rest the ankle to prevent further damage and keep weight off of it. Ice. Using ice will help slow or reduce the swelling and provide a numbing sensation that will ease the pain. Proper icing includes icing within 48 hours of an injury, never leave ice on for longer than 15 minutes to 20 minutes at a time to prevent frostbite. Wait 40 minutes to 45 minutes before applying ice again to allow tissues to return to normal temperature and sensation, and repeat as needed. You can apply an ice compress using a plastic freezer bag filled with ice cubes and water to mold to your ankle or use a frozen bag of veggies like corn or peas, (don't eat them after you use them and refreeze them), use a layer of towel between your skin and the plastic bag. Compression. Wrapping the injured ankle with an elastic bandage or off-the-shelf compression wrap will help keep it immobile and supported. Be sure not to wrap the ankle too tightly. If your toes that turn blue, get cold or lose sensation the wrap is too tight. Elevate. Elevating the injured ankle to at least the level of your heart will reduce swelling and pain. It is important not to put any weight on the ankle until after it's been evaluated by a doctor, which should be done as soon as possible. Fractures and sprains that are ignored or aren't treated properly can lead to long-term chronic problems with the ankle, such as repeated injury, ankle weakness, and arthritis. The first thing a doctor will do is ask questions about how the injury occurred. Then the doctor will examine the ankle, noting the amount of swelling and bruising. The physical examination of the ankle may be painful because the doctor needs to move the ankle to evaluate the pain and swelling in order to make a proper diagnosis. The doctor may order an ankle X-ray to determine whether there are any broken bones. In addition to an ankle X-ray, your doctor may ask for X-rays of the leg and foot to determine whether there may be other related injuries. If the doctor suspects a stress fracture, the doctor will ask for other imaging scans such as an MRI, which will show more detail about the injury. If there is a fracture, the doctor may also ask for a stress test, which is a special X-ray taken with pressure applied to the joint. This will help the doctor determine whether surgery is needed. For most ankle injuries, pain is controlled by using an over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen. The specific treatment of the injury depends on the type of injury. Fractures can be treated either surgically or nonsurgically. The doctor may treat the break without surgery by immobilizing the ankle if only one bone is broken, and if the bones are not out of place and the ankle is stable. Typically the doctor will do this by putting on a brace that works as a splint or by putting on a cast. If the ankle is unstable, the fracture will be treated surgically. Often, the ankle is made stable by using a metal plate and screws to hold the bones in place. Following the surgery, the ankle is protected with a splint until the swelling goes down and then with a cast. It usually takes at least six weeks for the bones to heal. Your doctor will probably ask you to keep weight off the ankle during that time so the bones can heal in the proper alignment. Ligaments and tendons can take longer to heal after a fracture is fully mended. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full painfree motion and strength after an ankle fracture, although most people are able to resume their normal daily routine within three to four months. After the doctor has determined it is safe for you to start moving your ankle, you may need physical therapy to provide gait training, balance, strengthening, and mobility exercises. The therapist will develop a home program that you can use to regain your previous normal function. It can take several months to return to a normal walking pattern without limping. The treatment for sprains depends on the severity of the injury. They are graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Surgery is not usually a treatment option unless the damage is extensive, involves more than the ligaments, or when other treatment options fail. Mild sprains -- called grade 1 -- are treated with the RICE approach for several days until the pain and swelling improve. With a mild sprain, you won't need a splint or a cast. Your doctor will tell you to put weight on the ankle fairly soon -- within one to three days -- as long as you can tolerate it and will prescribe range of motion, stretching, and strengthening exercises. If your sprain is classified as moderate, or grade 2, the doctor will use the RICE approach but allow more time for healing to occur. The doctor may also use a device such as a boot or a splint to immobilize the ankle. You will be given exercises to do first to improve range of motion and then to stretch and strengthen the ankle. The doctor may also prescribe physical therapy to help you regain full use of your ankle. Grade 3 or a severe sprain involves a complete tear or rupture of a ligament and takes considerably longer to heal. It's treated with immobilization of the joint followed by a longer period of physical therapy for range of motion, stretching, and strength building. Occasionally, especially if the sprain does not heal in a reasonable time, surgery will be considered for reconstructing the torn ligaments. On average, the initial treatment of a sprain, includes resting, and protecting the ankle until swelling goes down for about one week. That's followed by a period of one to two weeks of exercise to restore range of motion, strength, and flexibility. It can take several more weeks to several months to gradually return to your normal activities while you continue to exercise. Options for treating tendon injuries are similar to options for treating sprains. They include: Immobilization using a cast or splint Oral or injected anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain Physical therapy for range of motion, strength, and balance A brace to provide support during activities Surgery to repair the tendon or tendons and sometimes to repair the supporting structures of the foot The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following steps for reducing your risk of an ankle injury: Avoid exercising or playing sports when you are tired or in pain. Keep muscles strong by eating a well-balanced diet. Maintain a healthy weight. Try to avoid falling. Wear shoes that fit well and that are appropriate for the activity you are doing. Don't wear shoes that have heels worn down on one side. Exercise every day. Maintain the proper conditioning for whatever sport you are playing. Warm up and stretch before exercising or playing a sport. Wear the proper equipment for whatever sport you play. Run on flat surfaces."

Can I use over-the-counter medications, or do I need prescription drugs? If I need medicine, what are the possible side effects? Are there things I should avoid? Can I take something to prevent an allergic reaction? Are there other treatments that could help? Should I be worried about an allergic emergency? What should I watch for? Do I need to be concerned about other allergies?"
147,"When it comes to menstrual cycles, there's a wide range of ânormal.â But your period shouldn't be a problem for you month after month. If it's so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated. Doctors check these things when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding: How often you get your period: Your period should be fairly regular -- the length of each cycle usually shouldn't change by more than a week. And if it's shorter than 3 weeks or longer than 5, that could be a sign of a problem. How long it lasts: A typical period lasts 4 or 5 days. If yours is often less than 2 days or longer than a week, that could mean something's wrong. How heavy it is: Most women only lose about 2 tablespoons of blood each period. More than 5 tablespoons is thought to be unusually heavy, but that's hard to judge. Let your doctor know if you need more than one tampon or pad in an hour. Abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding is called menorrhagia. You have spotting between periods. You have bleeding after sex. If you could be pregnant or you're past menopause and have any kind of bleeding, call your doctor. Some spotting is common early in pregnancy, but bleeding can be a sign of a serious condition called an ectopic pregnancy. That's when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside your uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. It could also mean you're having a miscarriage. After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation), certain hormones tell your body to build up then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium). With teenagers and women who are getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much, and that can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods. These things can throw off your hormones, too: Birth control pills and other medicines Fast weight loss or gain Emotional or physical stress An intrauterine device ( IUD) Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. And a condition called adenomyosis causes the endometrium to grow into the tissue of the uterus. These are much less common, but abnormal uterine bleeding also can be caused by: Bleeding or clotting disorders or blood-thinning medicines Cancer of the cervix, endometrium, or uterus Illnesses that affect your kidneys, liver, thyroid, or adrenal glands Infection of your cervix or endometrium It can help to take detailed notes over a few cycles so you can give your doctor specific information about your symptoms. They'll also ask about your overall health and give you a physical exam. You'll probably get a pregnancy test, and you may also have: Blood work: Heavy bleeding can leave your body short of iron. A blood test can see if that's a problem for you. It can also show if your hormones are out of balance or if you have a blood disorder or chronic disease. Ultrasound: This uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your uterus so your doctor can look for fibroids or polyps. Hysteroscopy: Your doctor will look inside your uterus with a tiny lighted scope that they put in through your cervix. Biopsy: Your doctor may take out a small piece of tissue so it can be checked under a microscope for abnormal cells. Magnetic resonance imaging scan: This uses radio waves and powerful magnets to make detailed pictures of your uterus. It's not used that often, but it can help spot adenomyosis. This will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding -- if a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Your treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you're close to menopause, your doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own. Drugs are usually the first thing your doctor will try: Hormones. Birth control pills and other hormone treatments may be able to give you regular menstrual cycles and lighter periods. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists ( Gn RHa). These stop your body from making certain hormones. They can shrink fibroids for a while, but they're usually used along with other treatments. NSAIDS. If you take anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or naproxen a few days before your period starts, they may help lighten the bleeding. Tranexamic acid. This is a pill that helps your blood clot and can control heavy uterine bleeding. For some women, an IUD that releases a hormone called progestin can stop heavy bleeding. Many women who use one don't get a period at all. Sometimes surgery can be needed to stop the bleeding: Endometrial ablation. This uses heat, cold, electricity, or a laser to destroy the lining of the uterus. It may end your periods entirely. You probably won't be able to get pregnant after having it done, but it can be very dangerous if you do. You'll need to use birth control until menopause. Myomectomy or uterine artery embolization. If you have fibroids, your doctor may take them out or cut off the vessels that supply them with blood. Hysterectomy. This is when your uterus is taken out. You may need a hysterectomy if your fibroids are very large or you have endometrial or uterine cancer. Otherwise, it's a last resort when other treatments haven't worked."
148,"It can be a challenge for doctors to diagnose multiple sclerosis ( MS). There's no single test that can prove you have it. And many conditions have symptoms that seem like MS. A neurologist -- a doctor who specializes in treating the disease -- should be able to help. They'll ask how you're feeling and help you figure out if your symptoms mean you have MS or another problem. A certain set of signs points to MS. Your doctor will need to: Find damage to at least two areas of your central nervous system (your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves) Prove the damage happened at different points in time Rule out any other diagnosis The doctor will start by asking you about your medical history and your symptoms. They'll also do a few tests to see if your brain and spinal cord are working as they should. These include: MRI: This imaging test lets the doctor take a closer look at your brain. They can see changes caused by multiple sclerosis like signs of inflammation in the deep parts of your brain or spinal cord. But older people or those with high blood pressure and diabetes also can have the same kinds of spots on a brain MRI. So the doctor will consider other info, including your symptoms, along with the scan results before they make a diagnosis. Also, an MRI result that says things are normal doesn't rule out MS. You could be one of a small number of people who have lesions in places the scan can't show. Spinal taps: This test, which you may also hear called lumbar puncture, checks the fluid that runs through your spinal column. Doctors use it to look for high levels of proteins and other substances that are signs of the disease. It can help diagnose MS, but it, too, isn't absolute proof. Evoked potentials: These electrical nerve tests can help doctors confirm if MS has affected the parts of your brain that help you see, hear, and feel. The doctor will place wires on your scalp to test your brain's response as you watch a pattern on a video screen, hear a series of clicks, or get electrical pulses on your arm or leg. Blood tests: They can't diagnose MS, but the doctor will use them to look for substances in your blood that point to it. Most importantly, they can help your doctor rule out conditions that look like MS. It may take a long time to figure out that you have MS. If you've been waiting years or months, the news might be a relief. Or it could be a huge shock. Either way, you'll have concerns about what the disease means for your life and your family. That's completely understandable. Talk with others -- your friends, your doctor, a support group, or a counselor -- about your feelings. Your health care team can help you decide the best ways to treat your disease and live with it day to day. MS affects everyone differently, so what works for one person with the condition may not be what's best for you."
149,"Precision medicine revolves around the idea that a condition -- like cancer or heart disease -- in you isn't necessarily the same as in someone else. Instead, the genes you got from your parents, and the environment you live in, can influence your health, the symptoms you have, and even how well treatments might work. If scientists can understand the root of these differences, they think they can develop treatments that are more effective. It's becoming clearer that medicine is not one-size-fits-all. For example, a treatment that helps shrink one person's tumor or eases their arthritis symptoms doesn't always work for somebody else. Picture this: You get detailed tests that can gauge how your arthritis or cancer differs from someone else's. Then you get a treatment that's tailored to you, rather than to anyone else. Precision medicine, at its core, is about matching the right drugs to the right people. But today it's not yet possible for every disease. So even though it sounds like a great idea, your doctor might still give you the standard drug that most other people get. At least for now. Where precision medicine is starting to make a difference is in the treatment of some cancers. Researchers are beginning to change how they classify tumors. The genetics of some breast cancers, for instance, may be more like stomach tumors than other breast cancers. With precision medicine, cancers that are genetically alike are treated similarly. For example, doctors know a drug called Gleevec (imatinib) works to treat leukemia only when the cancer cells have one particular genetic makeup. So, rather than treat everyone with leukemia using Gleevec, doctors test people for that specific genetic mix and give the drug only to those who have it. They're using the same approach to decide which meds people take for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, as well as melanoma. Just as traditional drugs aren't a sure bet to cure cancer, precision medicines aren't always a permanent cure. Cancers can evolve over time and become resistant to a treatment. Or a drug may work against only part of a tumor, which lets the remaining part continue to grow. To test all this out, researchers are turning to something called âbasket trials.â The âbasketâ is based on the genetics of your cancer, not where it is in your body. For example, in a basket trial researchers are using today to test cancer drugs, people with many types of cancer are grouped together. The treatment they receive is based on the genetics of their tumor. Researchers hope the results will help show the success of precision medicine. Genes are a big part of precision medicine, but they may not be the entire focus. Doctors could one day use other methods to determine how to customize your care. These could include: The perfect diet for you -- and only you Tests to find the bacteria in your digestive system Blood samples to count your immune cells Real-time tracking of your blood sugar levels, heartbeat, or blood pressure Anything that can give doctors a better sense of you as an individual has the potential to help them figure out how to make you healthier."
150,"Any disease can cause problems in other parts of your body. Your doctor will call these complications. Myelofibrosis is no exception. There's no guarantee you'll have other problems. But if you do, they're likely to show up after you've been diagnosed for a while. You may not get them. But if you know what types of issues can affect you, you'll be more likely to spot them early on. Belly and back pain: Do you have a feeling of fullness or discomfort in the upper left area of your tummy? You may have an enlarged spleen. If the organ gets too big, it can cause pain when it pushes against other body parts. Bleeding: After you've had myelofibrosis for a while, the number of platelets in your blood will drop below normal levels. When you don't have enough platelets, you tend to bleed more easily. Keep this in mind in case you plan to have surgery or another medical procedure. Bone and joint pain: Your bones may feel hard on the outside, but inside they're full of a spongy substance called marrow. Its job is to make blood cells. Myelofibrosis can cause your bone marrow to harden. When that happens, the connective tissues that surround your bones become inflamed. The result: achy or tender bones and joint tenderness. Growths: Blood cells are supposed to form inside your bone marrow. But myelofibrosis might cause them to grow in other parts of your body, like your lungs, liver, spleen, and digestive tract. This can cause clumps or tumors that your doctor will call extramedullary hematopoiesis. They can make you bleed, cough up blood, or have seizures. Gout: Your body makes uric acid when it breaks down foods like steak, organ meats, and seafood. When you have myelofibrosis, your body makes more uric acid than normal. When it builds up, it forms needle-like crystals in your joints. They cause sharp pain, swollen joints, and inflammation. Portal hypertension: Blood leaves your spleen and goes to your liver through the portal vein. When you have an enlarged spleen, the blood goes out under high pressure. This can force it into smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus. Sometimes they burst and bleed. Acute leukemia: Some people who have myelofibrosis will get acute myeloid leukemia. This blood cancer can get worse quickly if it isn't treated."
151,"To check if you have heart failure, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and may order some tests, as well. Once he figures out what's going on, the two of you will work together to get the right treatment. First, your doctor will want to know if you: Have other conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, angina, high blood pressure, or other heart problems Smoke Drink alcohol, and how much Take medications, and which ones Your doctor will also do a physical exam. He'll look for signs of heart failure as well as other illnesses that may have weakened your heart. The doctor may suggest you get some tests to find the cause of your heart failure and see how severe it is. Blood tests. They look at your kidney and thyroid gland health and measure your cholesterol levels. They also check if you have anemia, which happens when you don't have enough healthy red blood cells. B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) blood test. Brain natriuretic peptide is a substance your body makes. Your heart releases it when heart failure develops. It is turned into N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro BNP). Levels of both can be higher in people with heart failure. These tests can be used to help figure out if a patient's shortness of breath is caused by heart failure. Chest X-ray. This shows the size of your heart. It also lets your doctor know if there's a buildup of fluid around your heart and lungs. Echocardiogram . This test, often called an ""echo,"" shows your heart's movement. During this exam, your doctor places a wand on the surface of your chest. It sends ultrasound waves that show pictures of your heart's valves and chambers. Those images let your doctor look at how well your ticker is pumping. Your doctor may combine an echocardiogram with tests called Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to check blood flow across your heart's valves. Ejection fraction ( EF). It's a measure of how much blood is pumped out of your heart each time it beats. A normal amount is between 55% and 75%, which means that over half of the blood volume is pumped out of the heart with each beat. Heart failure may happen because of a low EF. Electrocardiogram ( EKG). This records the electrical impulses traveling through your heart. During the test, your doctor puts small, flat, sticky patches called electrodes on your chest. They're attached to a monitor that charts your heart's electrical activity on graph paper. This test can tell your heart rhythm and give a general roadmap of your heart's ability to pump blood. Cardiac catheterization. This measures whether you have clogged heart arteries (called coronary artery disease). Your doctor may also call it coronary angiogram. Cardiac MRI. This less-commonly used test helps your doctor figure out if you have problems with your heart muscle or the tissues that surround the heart. CT coronary angiogram. It uses an X-ray and a contrast dye to see if you have coronary artery disease. Your doctor can view images in 3- D, which lets him see blockages in your arteries. Myocardial biopsy. In this test, your doctor puts a small, flexible biopsy catheter into a vein in your neck or groin, and takes a small piece of your heart muscle. This test can diagnose certain types of heart muscle diseases that cause heart failure. Stress test. Your heart gets ""stressed"" when you walk on a treadmill or take medications that increase its pumping. It helps your doctor find clogged heart arteries."
152,"If you are suffering from insomnia, there are many steps you can take to change behaviors and lifestyle to help you get to sleep. Here are some tips for beating insomnia. Wake up at the same time each day. It is tempting to sleep late on weekends, especially if you have had poor sleep during the week. However, if you suffer from insomnia you should get up at the same time every day in order to train your body to wake at a consistent time. Eliminate alcohol and stimulants like nicotine and caffeine. The effects of caffeine can last for several hours, perhaps up to 24 hours, so the chances of it affecting sleep are significant. Caffeine may not only cause difficulty initiating sleep, but may also cause frequent awakenings. Alcohol may have a sedative effect for the first few hours following consumption, but it can then lead to frequent arousals and a non-restful night's sleep. If you are on medications that act as stimulants, such as decongestants or asthma inhalers, ask your doctor when they should best be taken to help minimize any affect on sleep. Limit naps. While napping seems like a proper way to catch up on missed sleep, it is not always so. It is important to establish and maintain a regular sleep pattern and train oneself to associate sleep with cues like darkness and a consistent bedtime. Napping can affect the quality of nighttime sleep. Exercise regularly. Regular exercise can improve sleep quality and duration. However, exercising immediately before bedtime can have a stimulant effect on the body and should be avoided. Try to finish exercising at least three hours before you plan to retire for the night. Limit activities in bed. The bed is for sleeping and having sex and that's it. If you suffer from insomnia, do not balance the checkbook, study, or make phone calls, for example, while in bed or even in the bedroom, and avoid watching television or listening to the radio. All these activities can increase alertness and make it difficult to fall asleep. Do not eat or drink right before going to bed. Eating a late dinner or snacking before going to bed can activate the digestive system and keep you up. If you suffer from gastroesophageal reflux ( GERD) or heartburn, it is even more important to avoid eating and drinking right before bed since this can make your symptoms worse. In addition, drinking a lot of fluids prior to bed can overwhelm the bladder, requiring frequent visits to the bathroom that disturb your sleep. Make your sleeping environment comfortable. Temperature, lighting, and noise should be controlled to make the bedroom conducive to falling (and staying) asleep. Your bed should feel comfortable and if you have a pet that sleeps in the room with you, consider having the pet sleep somewhere else if it tends to make noise in the night. Get all your worrying over with before you go to bed. If you find you lay in bed thinking about tomorrow, consider setting aside a period of time -- perhaps after dinner -- to review the day and to make plans for the next day. The goal is to avoid doing these things while trying to fall asleep. It is also useful to make a list of, say, work-related tasks for the next day before leaving work. That, at least, eliminates one set of concerns. Reduce stress. There are a number of relaxation therapies and stress reduction methods you may want to try to relax the mind and the body before going to bed. Examples include progressive muscle relaxation (perhaps with audio tapes), deep breathing techniques, imagery, meditation, and biofeedback. Consider participating in cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy helps some people with insomnia identify and correct inappropriate thoughts and beliefs that may contribute to insomnia. In addition, cognitive therapy can give you the proper information about sleep norms, age-related sleep changes, and help set reasonable sleep goals, among other things."
153,"If you have IBS with constipation you probably already know how important fiber-rich foods are for your comfort. Making the American Dietetic Association's recommendation to eat 25 grams of fiber a day for women and 38 grams for men your mealtime mantra is a great place to start. But in order for a high-fiber eating plan to work its magic, you have to do three things: Gradually increase the fiber in your diet to your target amount. Reach the higher-fiber target almost every day. Food sources are best. But fiber supplements such as psyllium and methylcellulose can also help. Spread high-fiber foods throughout the day so it works better. Drink plenty of water and other noncaffeinated, noncaloric liquids/beverages throughout the day as well. Fiber works better in the intestines if there is plenty of water to go with it. To get enough fiber in the fastest and most painless way possible, try these five steps. Then enjoy the three delicious recipes at the end of this article. No. 1 -- Get Those Whole Grains First, make sure you are not gluten sensitive.

154,"Most of us don't like to think about drawing up a will, signing ""do not resuscitate"" orders, or planning funeral services. So we don't. But when we're diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, these things suddenly take on a new urgency. In the midst of coping with the medical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual challenges of serious illness, mundane logistical details must be managed as well. And if you don't address them now, someone else will have to address them later. Before time begins to run short, it's important to make sure that you put everything in order as you would like it to be. What are the most important things you need in end-of-life planning? The must-do list: A will, advance directives, durable power of attorney for health care decisions, and funeral and burial/cremation preferences. More than half of U. S. adults don't have a will. But you need one, even if you don't have a vast estate to distribute among your heirs. People who die intestate -- the legal term for ""without a will"" -- send their loved ones to court to navigate the probate process and to deal with dividing property while they're still grieving. And ask yourself this: Do you want to determine where your assets go, or do you want the state to do it? Writing a will isn't that difficult. There are a number of inexpensive online will writing programs. Better still, hire a family law attorney to help you draft one. The costs vary widely based on where you live and how much time your situation will require from the lawyer, but unless you have an enormous estate to divide, it shouldn't be bank breaking. In addition to stipulating where you want your property to go, your will or an accompanying document should also include papers outlining your plans for guardianship of minor children, if you have any. Sometimes called a living will, this document spells out the measures you would like taken, or not taken, to prolong your life. This document is legally binding. It's so important, Web MD has devoted a special article to advance directives. Designating someone to have your power of attorney for health care does not mean you give up any power to make your own decisions. But there may come a point when you cannot speak for yourself. At that point, you will need someone to make decisions such as whether or not you would want to be kept alive on a ventilator. This person should have a copy of your advance directives, and should know your specific wishes regarding the kinds of lifesaving measures you do and do not want. Forms for assigning durable power of attorney for health care are available online. When someone has just died, grieving family members must often think fairly quickly about plans for funerals or memorial services. In the immediate aftermath of death, it can be hard to focus on details such as what your favorite song was or what kind of burial you would prefer. Sit down with someone you trust -- a social worker with your palliative care team can often help you brainstorm about important details -- and write down all the things that are important to you about your funeral, memorial service, and how your body is dealt with. Some questions to think about: Do you want a funeral or memorial service? In a church, synagogue, mosque, or somewhere else? Who should preside? What would you like to have read, sung, or said at your service? Is there someone you would particularly like to have speak? Would you like your body to be viewed after your death? By close family only? Would you like to record an audio or video message for a service after your death? How would you like your body to be dealt with? Do you prefer burial or cremation? How do you feel about organ donation or donating your body to medical research? For all of these and other end-of-life planning issues, your palliative care team can help you find a financial planner, attorney, or other professional who can make sure that your wishes are carried out and respected. It's also important to think about the personal side of estate planning, according to experts at, Capital Caring, which cares for more than 1,000 people living with advanced illness in the Washington, D. C. area daily. The experts say that before you appoint someone to carry out your health care power of attorney or to be the guardian of your children, you should ask the person first and talk through what the responsibilities will be and what your wishes are. Also, in addition to legal, financial, and health care matters, don't forget to plan for your emotional, psychological, and spiritual needs. In other words, make your ""bucket list."" A list like this isn't just about going skydiving or seeing the Pyramids. It's about the things that matter most to you and ensuring that they are taken care of before you die. For example, if your grandson is getting married or your daughter is graduating from high school, your list might include being strong enough to attend those events or, if that's not possible, recording a loving message or writing a letter to share with them on that day. When making all of these plans, the important thing is to talk openly with the people you love. Having those open conversations will help to make the transition easier and less painful for everyone. It will also help you deal with any unresolved issues."
155,"Test your eyesight without a trip to the eye doctor? Online vision tests aim to make it possible. Several companies offer tests that you can take on the internet with your computer or smartphone. An online vision test might check: How sharp your vision is If you have astigmatism, a condition that can make things blurry or stretched How sensitive your eyes are to light If you have color-blindness, meaning you can't see colors correctly These eye tests can be helpful in some situations, like if you break or lose your glasses when you're far from home and you need a prescription to get new ones. But they can't replace regular visits to your eye doctor. That's because they are only about vision -- they don't check the health of your eyes. They can't tell you if you have a condition that can threaten your sight, like cataracts, glaucoma, or macular degeneration. If you think you have an infection or you've injured your eyes, you should see an eye doctor. Online vision tests are meant for healthy adults ages 18 to 39 who: Already have a prescription for eyeglasses and it's not very strong Have already had a complete eye exam and know their eyes are healthy Have no risks for eye disease, like diabetes or high blood pressure Even if you are the right age and healthy enough to take an online vision test, you should still get regular eye exams as often as your eye doctor recommends. An online vision test can have a few steps. You'll need a computer and some space to sit back so you can take the part of the test that checks your distance vision. Some tests also need you to have a smartphone so you can use an app. If you have prescription eyeglasses or contacts, chances are you'll need to wear them for the test. Some websites offer tests just to check your vision. If you get results that say you might have a problem, it will be up to you to see an eye doctor. Other websites offer prescriptions for glasses and contacts based on the results of your tests. An eye doctor in your state will check over your results and email you a prescription. Then you can order glasses or contacts online. Not every state will allow you to get an eye prescription this way. The websites that offer prescriptions will charge a fee. Chances are your vision or health insurance won't cover it. It might be cheaper for you to use your insurance to see an eye doctor. Check your plan to see what it covers. Doctors disagree about whether online vision tests are accurate. And because they are still new, researchers haven't studied them well enough to know for sure how they compare to an exam you'd get from your eye doctor. One thing to keep in mind is that if you don't take the test correctly, you might not get an accurate result. Plus, the tests are not designed for people who need a strong prescription for eyeglasses. The bottom line: Before you take an online vision test, make sure you understand what it can and can't tell you. And keep your regular appointments with your eye doctor to make sure you're healthy."
156,"Even if you're usually healthy, the flu can knock you off your feet for days -- even weeks. And it doesn't always happen, but there's a chance that it could lead to more serious health problems, or ""complications,"" like sinusitis (sinus infections), bronchitis, or pneumonia. But if you know what the symptoms are and how to take precautions, you can avoid these problems and stay healthy. It's a very contagious disease caused by the influenza virus. People tend to catch it most often in the fall and winter. It comes on fast and strong, spreading through your upper respiratory tract and sometimes invading your lungs. You may have: Fever (usually high Headache Tiredness (can be extreme) Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Body aches Diarrhea and vomiting (more common among children than adults) They include viral or bacterial pneumonia, dehydration, and ear infections and sinus infections, especially in children. The flu can worsen long-term medical conditions, like congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. You might also have muscle inflammation (myositis), problems with your central nervous system, and heart problems such as heart attacks, inflammation of the organ (myocarditis), and inflammation of the sac around it (pericarditis). Adults over 65 Children ages 6 months to 4 years Nursing home residents Adults and children with heart or lung disease People with compromised immune systems (including people with HIV/ AIDS) Pregnant women It can happen when the flu virus enters your lung or when you get a bacterial infection during the course of the illness. Pneumonia can make you quite ill and may send you to the hospital. It can cause chills, fever, chest pains, and sweating. You might have a cough with green or bloody mucus. You could notice a faster pulse, and your lips or nails might have a bluish tint because of a lack of oxygen. Other symptoms include shortness of breath and sharp pains in your chest when you take a deep breath. Seniors may only notice a pain in the belly. When you get a bacterial infection with the flu, your symptoms may get better at first. Then they get worse with high fevers, more coughing, and a greenish tinge to what you're coughing up. Call your doctor if you have a cough that won't stop, a bad fever, or if you get shortness of breath or chest pains. The doctor can do tests to find out if you have pneumonia. Antibiotics can treat bacterial pneumonia, but these meds can't treat viral pneumonia. It can hang around for about 2 weeks, or even longer in young children, elderly adults, and those who have weakened immune systems or ongoing illness like COPD or asthma. Even healthy people may feel tired or weak for a month or more after their lungs clear up. There are 2 types: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV23) for adults and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13) for children. The adult vaccine protects against 23 types of bacteria that commonly cause pneumonia. Doctors suggest that healthy seniors over 65 get both vaccines. The timing and sequence in which you get them will vary depending on what vaccines you've already had. Some experts say adults younger than 55 should get both vaccines to boost their immune system. The pneumonia vaccine isn't recommended for pregnant women. But it can help people at increased risk for infections, like those with: Heart disease Liver disease Lung disease Kidney failure Diabetes Some cancers Sickle cell anemia HIV/ AIDS Asthma (or smokers) ages 19 through 64 Children under age 2 should get four doses of the PCV13 vaccine. Tots between 2 and 4 who didn't get the pneumonia vaccine series should get a single vaccine. Children 6 to 18 with health problems should get a single dose of PCV13 whether they had shots already or not. Call him if you have a high fever and a hard time breathing. Other serious symptoms include: Fever with shaking chills Coughing with blood-tinged mucus from the lungs Trouble breathing Rapid breathing Shortness of breath Chest pains Wheezing Many can be managed. But some, depending on how weak your immune system is, can't be prevented. If you do get the flu, call your doctor within 48 hours after your symptoms show up. Ask about a flu antiviral drug. If you get them early enough, they can help ease your symptoms and help you get well sooner."
157,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it's passed down to you from your parents. It can cause serious lung or liver disease. You may also hear it called AAT deficiency. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. You need AAT to protect your lungs. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. When they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. For some people, AAT deficiency can cause chronic pulmonary obstructive disease ( COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight. You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and causes breathing problems. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. This is something you'll need to do the rest of your life. Keep in mind that no two cases of AAT deficiency are alike. Not everyone gets severe symptoms. With treatment, you'll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through. You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get it between the ages of 20 and 40. You may feel short of breath, especially when you try to exercise. You also could start to wheeze or have a whistling sound when you breathe. You may also get a lot of lung infections. Other warning signs include: Feeling tired Your heart beats fast when you stand up Weight loss If AAT deficiency causes problems with your liver, you could have symptoms like: Yellowish skin or eyes Swollen belly or legs Coughing up blood A newborn baby might have: Jaundice, a yellow tint to the skin or eyes Yellow urine Trouble gaining weight An enlarged liver Bleeding from the nose or umbilical stump It's rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency runs in families. If you have it, you got it from faulty genes that both your parents passed down to you. Some people get the genes but don't have any symptoms. Or they have a mild version of the disease. The broken genes you get from your parents cause you to have a low level of AAT protein in your blood. It can build up in the liver instead of going into your bloodstream. That buildup in your liver causes liver disease. The shortage of AAT protein in your bloodstream leads to lung disease. Your doctor may ask you questions such as: Do you feel short of breath? Have you been getting a lot of colds or lung infections? Have you lost weight lately? Have you noticed any yellowing of your skin or eyes? Your doctor will also listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. You need to get blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests check to see if you have the broken genes that cause AAT deficiency. They also look to see how much of the protein you have in your bloodstream. Your doctor will also tests your lungs and liver to see how much damage the condition has caused. For example, a chest X-ray might shows signs of emphysema. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. You might breathe into a tube to see how much air you're getting into your lungs. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy. For this test, your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check them for signs of damage. Although there's no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage. Doctors call this augmentation therapy. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. Augmentation therapy is also called replacement therapy. You get a new supply of AAT protein that comes from the blood of healthy human donors. You get the treatment once a week. The replacement alpha-1 gets into your body through an IV. You can have this done at home with the help of a technician, or you can go to a doctor's office. The goal of augmentation therapy is to slow or stop the damage in your lungs. It won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You'll need these treatments for the rest of your life. Depending on how you're doing, you also may get medication that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. Doctors call this a bronchodilator, meaning that it opens your airways. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need to get extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor will also give you a referral for pulmonary rehab to help you breathe better. Good habits are important to help you stay healthy with this condition. You shouldn't smoke, and you need to get a pneumonia vaccine and your annual flu shot. Talk to your doctor about how to exercise safely, which strengthens your lungs. Good nutrition -- including supplements with vitamins E, D, and K -- can help you keep your liver healthy. Avoid dust and smoke, and wash your hands often to prevent infection. Limit the alcohol you drink to protect your liver. Babies with AAT deficiency may need a special milk formula or extra vitamins. It's also important for them to have regular medical checkups to keep track of how well their lungs and liver are working. Support from your loved ones, and from others who have the same condition, also makes a big difference, so you know there are people who understand what you're going through. Ask your doctor any question you have about this condition. You might start with these: Have you treated other people with AAT deficiency? How can I protect my lungs and liver? What treatment do you suggest? How will we know how I'm doing? Should I get my children tested for this condition? AAT deficiency is different for everyone. Some people have severe problems. Others may have few or no symptoms. In babies and children, the condition is more likely to cause liver damage than lung problems. Still, only about 10% of children with it have severe liver disease. Children with AAT deficiency also may have asthma. You'll be more sensitive to smoke and dust. Even the common cold can lead to breathing problems. About 30% to 40% of people with this condition will have liver problems at some point in their lives. Finding out if you have AAT deficiency is the first step toward the healthy habits and medical treatments that help control the disease. You can find names of doctors, links to support groups, genetic counseling resources, and other information from the Alpha-1 Foundation website."

About half of adults who have asthma also have allergies. Adult-onset asthma also may be the result of commonplace irritants in the workplace (called occupational asthma) or home environments, and the asthma symptoms come on suddenly. Asthma is a disorder of the lungs that causes intermittent symptoms. In the airways there is: Swelling or inflammation, specifically in the airway linings Production of large amounts of mucus that is thicker than normal Narrowing because of muscle contractions surrounding the airways The symptoms of asthma include: Feeling short of breath Frequent coughing, especially at night Wheezing (a whistling noise during breathing) Difficulty breathing Chest tightness When a doctor makes a diagnosis of asthma in people older than age 20, it is known as adult-onset asthma. Among those who may be more likely to get adult-onset asthma are: Women who are having hormonal changes, such as those who are pregnant or who are experiencing menopause Women who take estrogen following menopause for 10 years or longer People who have just had certain viruses or illnesses, such as a cold or flu People with allergies, especially to cats People who have GERD, a type of chronic heartburn with reflux People who are exposed to environmental irritants, such as tobacco smoke, mold, dust, feather beds, or perfume Irritants that bring on asthma symptoms are called ""asthma triggers."" Asthma brought on by workplace triggers is called ""occupational asthma."" Adults tend to have a lower forced expiratory volume (the volume of air you are able to take in and forcibly exhale in one second) after middle age because of changes in muscles and stiffening of chest walls. This decreased lung function may cause doctors to miss the diagnosis of adult-onset asthma. Your asthma doctor may diagnose adult-onset asthma by: Taking a medical history, asking about symptoms, and listening to you breathe Performing a lung function test, using a device called a spirometer, to measure how much air you can exhale after first taking a deep breath and how fast you can empty your lungs. You may be asked before or after the test to inhale a short-acting bronchodilator (medicine that opens the airways by relaxing tight muscles and that also help clear mucus from the lungs). Performing a methacholine challenge test; this asthma test may be performed if your symptoms and spirometry test do not clearly show asthma. When inhaled, methacholine causes the airways to spasm and narrow if asthma is present. During this test, you inhale increasing amounts of methacholine aerosol mist before and after spirometry. The methacholine test is considered positive, meaning asthma is present, if the lung function drops by at least 20%. A bronchodilator is always given at the end of the test to reverse the effects of the methacholine. Performing a chest X-ray. An X-ray is an image of the body that is created by using low doses of radiation reflected on special film or a fluorescent screen. X-rays can be used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, from bronchitis to a broken bone. Your doctor might perform an X-ray exam on you in order to see the structures inside your chest, including the heart, lungs, and bones. By viewing your lungs, your doctor can see if you have a condition other than asthma that may account for your symptoms. Although there may be signs on an X-ray that suggest asthma, a person with asthma will often have a normal chest X-ray. Anyone can get asthma at any age. Among those at higher risk for asthma are people who: Have a family history of asthma Have a history of allergies (allergic asthma) Have smokers living in the household Live in urban areas Asthma is classified into four categories based upon frequency of symptoms and objective measures, such as peak flow measurements and/or spirometry results. These categories are: mild intermittent; mild persistent; moderate persistent; and severe persistent. Your physician will determine the severity and control of your asthma based on how frequently you have symptoms and on lung function tests. It is important to note that a person's asthma symptoms can change from one category to another. Symptoms occur less than twice a week, and nighttime symptoms occur less than two times per month. Lung function tests are 80% or more above predicted values. Predictions are often made on the basis of age, sex, and height. No medications are needed for long-term control. Symptoms occur three to six times per week. Lung function tests are 80% or more above predicted values. Nighttime symptoms occur three to four times a month. Symptoms occur daily. Nocturnal symptoms greater than five times per month. Asthma symptoms affect activity, occur more than two times per week, and may last for days. There is a reduction in lung function, with a lung function test range above 60% but below 80% of normal values. Symptoms occur continuously, with frequent nighttime asthma. Activities are limited. Lung function is decreased to less than 60% of predicted values. Asthma can be controlled, but there's no asthma cure. There are, however, certain goals in asthma treatment. If you are unable to achieve all of these goals, it means your asthma is not under control. You should contact your asthma care provider for help with asthma. Treatment goals include the following: Live an active, normal life Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms Attend work or school every day Perform daily activities without difficulty Stop urgent visits to the doctor, emergency room, or hospital Use and adjust medications to control asthma with little or no side effects Properly using asthma medication, as prescribed by your doctor, is the basis of good asthma control, in addition to avoiding triggers and monitoring daily asthma symptoms. There are two main types of asthma medications: Anti-inflammatories: This is the most important type of medication for most people with asthma. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as inhaled steroids, reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. As a result, airways are less sensitive and less likely to react to triggers. These medications need to be taken daily, and may need to be taken for several weeks before they begin to control asthma. Anti-inflammatories lead to a reduction in symptoms, better airflow, less sensitive airways, less airway damage, and fewer asthma episodes. If taken every day, they are helpful in controlling or preventing asthma flares. Oral steroids are taken for acute flares and help increase the efficacy of other medications and help reduce inflammation. Bronchodilators: These medications relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways. This action rapidly opens the airways, letting more air in and out of the lungs and improving breathing. As the airways open, the mucus moves more freely and can be coughed out more easily. Both short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists can be used for prevention of symptoms of exercise-induced asthma. An anticholinergic, such as tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva Respimat), which is available for individuals ages 6 and older, is another long-term maintenance medication for treating asthma. Asthma medications can be taken by inhaling the medications (using a metered dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or asthma nebulizer) or by swallowing oral medications (pills or liquids). If you are also taking drugs for other conditions, you should work with your providers to check drug interactions and simplify medications when possible. An important part of treatment is keeping track of how well the lungs are functioning. Asthma symptoms are monitored using a peak flow meter. The meter can alert you to changes in the airways that may be a sign of worsening asthma. By taking daily peak flow readings, you can learn when to adjust medications to keep asthma under good control. Your doctor can also use this information to adjust your treatment plan. Based on your history and the severity of your asthma, your doctor will develop a care plan called an asthma action plan. The asthma action plan describes when and how to use asthma medications, actions to take when asthma worsens, and when to seek care for an asthma emergency. Make sure you understand this plan; if not, ask your asthma care provider any questions you may have."
159,"Treatment of pain during intercourse depends on the cause. Pain at initial penetration may be treated when the cause is identified. Atrophy (thinning of the vaginal walls): Entrance pain caused by atrophy is common among postmenopausal women who do not take hormone replacement medication. Blood flow, lubrication, and tissue thickness and elasticity respond directly to hormone replacement. The most rapid relief of atrophy comes from applying topical estrogen vaginal cream directly to the vagina and its opening. This cream is available by prescription only. Over-the-counter lubricants and moisturizers can also be helpful. An oral drug taken once a day, ospemifene ( Osphena), makes vaginal tissue thicker and less fragile, resulting in less pain for women during sex. The FDA warns that Osphena can thicken the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) and raise the risk of stroke and blood clots. Urethritis and urethral syndrome: With this condition, a woman may urinate frequently with urgency, pain, and difficulty, but a urinalysis can find no identifiable bacteria. These symptoms may be caused by chronic inflammation of the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the body), from muscle spasms, anxiety, low estrogen levels, or a combination of these causes. Using a special instrument, the doctor may dilate the urethra if it is narrowed. The doctor may prescribe low-dose antibiotics. At times, antidepressants and antispasmodics may also be prescribed. Inadequate lubrication: Treatment of inadequate lubrication depends on the cause. Treatment options include water-soluble lubricants (for use with condoms; other types of lubricants may damage condoms) or other substances such as vegetable oils. If arousal does not take place, more extensive foreplay might be needed during sexual relations. Vaginismus: Painful spasms of muscles at the opening of the vagina may be an involuntary but appropriate response to painful stimuli. These spasms may be due to several factors, including painful insertion, previous painful experiences, previous abuse, or an unresolved conflict regarding sexuality. For a woman with vaginismus, her doctor may recommend behavioral therapy, including vaginal relaxation exercises. Vaginal strictures (abnormal narrowing): Doctors commonly see vaginal strictures after pelvic surgery, radiation, or menopause. Estrogen, or special surgical techniques may be used to treat these strictures. Interstitial cystitis: This chronic inflammation of the bladder has no known cause (result of breakdown of the GAG, or protective layer, of the bladder); however, pain with intercourse is a common symptom. It can be diagnosed with a potassium leak test or a cystoscopy. A cystoscopy is a procedure to look inside the bladder and may distend (stretch) the bladder to examine the bladder wall. Cystoscopy often works to clear the condition. Other treatments include amitriptyline ( Elavil), nifedipine ( Procardia), pentosan polysulfate sodium ( Elmiron), or other prescription drugs. Other options include bladder washings with dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) or other agents or transcutaneous electric stimulation ( TENS) and acupuncture. Endometriosis: Endometriosis occurs when some of the tissue that lines the uterus is found outside the uterus. Pain during intercourse caused by endometriosis is not uncommon. Vulvovaginitis (inflammation of the vulva and vagina): Whether recurrent or chronic, this problem is common despite the rise in the number of over-the-counter treatments. If not responsive to self-treatment with lubricating gels or initial treatment by a doctor, a woman may need a more thorough evaluation to identify the cause. A doctor may ask the woman if she uses antibiotic or antifungal medication or if she douches. If so, these practices should be stopped to help determine whether a specific disease-causing organism is present. Treatment is based on the presence of bacteria or other organisms. Often, no single organism is identified. The doctor may talk to the woman about proper hygiene. If recurring symptoms are shared with a sexual partner, both individuals should be tested for sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs). A doctor considers the possibility of intermittent urethral infection with chlamydia, an STD, as well as a more obvious urinary tract infection, and then treats with the appropriate antibiotics. Treatment for deep thrust pain includes two strategies: Checking for pelvic adhesions (tissue that has become stuck together, sometimes developing after surgery) that may cause pain with intercourse and surgically removing them. Checking for ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease , endometriosis, uterine prolapse, or retroversion of the uterus (uterus is tilted backward instead of forward). Applying lubricating gels to the outer sexual organs, including the vulva and labia, and in the vagina, may be helpful to women and ease pain during intercourse. Intercourse position changes may also help."" Sex toys, such as vibrators, may also be useful. A woman should talk with her healthcare provider before attempting to use a vaginal dilator."
160,"Glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve, which connects your eye to your brain so you can see. The condition usally is due to too much pressure in the eye. But the ""normal-tension"" kind is different. There's a fluid that normally circulates around the front of your eye. With many kinds of glaucoma, that fluid doesn't drain as well as it should. So it backs up, much like water in a clogged drain. As a result, pressure builds up inside your eye. Over time, it starts to harm the optic nerve. But with normal-tension glaucoma, the optic nerve becomes damaged even though eye pressure stays within normal levels. Your doctor may call it ""low-tension"" or ""normal-pressure"" glaucoma. Doctors aren't sure why some people get normal-tension glaucoma. It may be that your optic nerve is more sensitive or fragile, so even normal amounts of pressure can damage it. The doctor should also ask whether you have had periods of abnormally low blood pressure either from excessive reaction to blood pressure medicine or from having had severe blood loss. This type of glaucoma also could be caused, in part, by not enough blood getting to your optic nerve. Poor blood flow can damage and eventually kill the cells that carry signals from your eye to your brain. A condition such as atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, can hamper how well your blood circulates. You're more likely to get this type of glaucoma if you: Have a family history of the condition Are of Japanese descent Have ever had heart disease You might not notice any problem in the early stages. Glaucoma is sometimes called a ""silent thief of sight."" Your optic nerve is like an electric cable. It's made up of more than a million tiny fibers, or ""wires."" As the nerve fibers die, you'll begin to get blind spots in your vision. But you may not notice them until most of your optic nerve fibers are dead. Without treatment, the first sign of normal-tension glaucoma is often the loss of your peripheral, or side, vision. You might start to miss things out of the corner of your eye. As the condition gets worse, your vision narrows. It's as if you're looking through a tunnel. If all the fibers in your optic nerve die, you become blind. Normal-tension glaucoma tends to worsen slowly. It's important to keep up with your regular eye exams with an ophthalmologist. That's a medical doctor who specializes in eye care and surgery. The exams can help find the disease before you lose vision. Your ophthalmologist will review your medical history and do a complete eye and vision exam. This will include taking your eye pressure. You'll get drops in your eyes to widen (or dilate) your pupils. Then your doctor will use a special magnifying glass to check the color and shape of your optic nerve. She'll also look for any damage or defects. The doctor will use different tests to measure the pressure inside your eye as well as the thickness of your cornea in the front of the eye. The ophthalmologist will also do what's called a visual field test to check for any losses in your peripheral vision that you may not notice yourself. Some people with normal-tension glaucoma have symptoms of blood vessel problems such as migraine headaches, cold hands and feet, or low blood pressure. Although glaucoma's damage can't be reversed, your doctor will try stop it from getting worse and slow or prevent more vision loss. She may prescribe eye drops, suggest laser treatment, or talk with you about surgery. Eye Drops These are usually the first step in glaucoma treatment. Some prescription drops cause your eye to make less fluid. That helps lower pressure. Other drops help the fluid drain from your eye better. Like all medicines, these may cause side effects, such as: Stinging or itchy eyes Blurry vision Changes in your pulse or heartbeat. Some drugs can cause problems when taken with other medications. Give your doctor a list of every medicine you take before you begin this treatment. Laser Treatment An eye surgeon will use a laser to unclog and open the drain holes in your eye. This way, fluid can flow out more easily and eye pressure will be reduced. You can get the laser treatment done in your ophthalmologist's office or an outpatient surgery center. Surgery If medicines and laser treatments don't control your eye pressure, your doctor may talk to you about different surgery options. One procedure, called a trabeculectomy, creates a new opening in the white of your eye (or sclera) for fluid to drain. Or you might be able to get a tiny drainage tube implanted in your eye to reduce pressure. Researchers are working to find the best treatment for normal-tension glaucoma that will help protect the optic nerve or improve blood flow to the nerve. Unfortunately, you can't prevent glaucoma. But blindness from the condition can often be prevented if it's diagnosed and treated early. So keep up with your regular eye exams done by an ophthalmologist."
161,"Congratulations! You've survived the first two months, and will soon be getting a glimpse of your baby's personality. Even though your little one is just 2 months old, your baby may already be smiling, looking at you, and starting to hold her head up! This is a great time to talk to your baby's doctor about these exciting developmental milestones and more. Here's what to expect at your baby's 2-month checkup. Give your baby's first combination immunizations. These may include: DTa P (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) Hib (haemophilus influenzae type b) IPV (polio vaccine) PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) HBV (hepatitis B) RV (rotavirus) Remember, these vaccines are safe, and your baby really needs them to protect her from many life-threatening illnesses, such as pertussis or whooping cough. Is your baby getting tummy time? Can your baby hold her head up sometimes? Has your baby smiled yet? Is your baby alert to sounds? Is your baby stretching and moving her arms and legs well? Should my baby be nursing less often now? When is it time to start solid food? Continue to feed your baby when she wants to be fed, about 7 to 8 times a day. Your baby may be going longer between feedings and have fewer poopy diapers, and that's okay. Spitting up is common. Holding your baby upright in your arms, in a swing, or in a car seat for about 30 minutes after feeding may help. Make sure you continue to burp her after each feeding. Don't give your baby infant cereal, juice, or other solids yet. Her digestive system is not ready. And NO water. Breast milk or formula is all your baby needs right now! I'm so tired -- when will my baby sleep through the night? How can I help my baby learn to go to sleep on her own? Just hang in there! Your baby may start sleeping for 6-hour stretches at night very soon -- some babies do this as early as 10 weeks of age. To encourage night sleep, change or feed your baby at night with low lights on and don't play with your baby right before bed. This way, your baby knows it's time to sleep, not play. To help your baby go to sleep on her own, put your baby down when she's drowsy, not overly tired. This is also a great time to start talking to your baby. She'll be fascinated by your voice and will likely respond with coos and smiles! And enjoy every moment -- your baby will change quickly!"
162,"Your doctors will plan your lung cancer treatment based on what you need. It will depend in part on: What type of the disease you have Its stage Whether the cancer has spread in your body The side effects the treatment may cause Your age and general health Your preferences and goals Ask your doctor to explain the recommended treatment plan, including its benefits, side effects, and how it might make you feel during and after it. This is an option when the cancer hasn't spread too far in your body. It's usually the best way to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. Your doctor can remove the part of the lung that has the tumor and the tissue around it. Or you may need to have your entire lung removed. You might also need radiation or chemotherapy after surgery. After the operation, you might need to stay in the hospital for about a week to heal before you go home to recover. However, minimally invasive procedures are being used more and more often. If you opt for one of those, you may get a tiny incision in the chest. Your surgeon will use a thoracoscope, a flexible tube that is used to examine the chest and get rid of tissue. If you have small-cell lung cancer, it might not be possible to remove it in an operation. If you have non-small cell lung cancer and can't have surgery, this treatment may be an option. Your doctor guides a thin needle through your skin until it touches the tumor inside your lung. Then an electric current passes through it to heat and kill the cancer cells. Doctors use a machine to point high-energy X-rays at a tumor to destroy it. It works for both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancers. You get radiation treatments a few days at a time over several weeks. You might get it before surgery to shrink a tumor to make it easier to remove, or after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Some people get it in combination with chemotherapy. It can also help relieve some of the symptoms of lung cancer, such as pain or bleeding. These medicines kill cancer cells in the body. It's an option for both types of lung cancer. You might get chemo before or after surgery, combined with radiation therapy. Or it might be your main treatment if surgery won't work for you. Your doctor may prescribe one type of chemo drug or a mix of different ones. You'll get them through an IV at a treatment center or hospital. You may need a few rounds of treatment over several weeks. Researchers are constantly looking for better ways to treat lung cancer and help people feel better and live longer. Scientists are studying new combinations of chemotherapy, new forms of radiation, and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. Drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells or tumors are called targeted treatments. Some of them seem to help control lung cancer that has spread. They include: Afatinib ( Gilotrif) Alectinib ( Alecensa) Bevacizumab ( Avastin) Brigatinib ( Alunbrig) Ceritinib ( Zykadia) Crizotinib ( Xalkori) Dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) Dacomitinib ( Vizimpro) Erlotinib ( Tarceva) Gefitinib ( Iressa) Lorlatinib ( Lorbrena) Necitumumab ( Portrazza) Osimertinib ( Tagrisso) Ramucirumab ( Cyramza) Trametinib ( Mekanist) Other drugs, such as atezolizumab ( Tecentriq), durvalumab ( Imfinzi), nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda), use the body's own defenses to attack cancer cells. Doctors call these meds immunotherapy. If you've had lung cancer surgery, your nurse or doctor can show you how to care for your surgical cut and let you know what things will help you recover. To ease skin irritation from radiation therapy, wear loose clothes, protect your chest from UV rays by avoiding the sun and wearing sunscreen, and use aloe vera or vitamin E cream. Don't use other skin lotions unless your doctor says they're OK. Also, don't let your skin get too hot or cold."
163,"Has your doctor recommended that you take more than one drug for rheumatoid arthritis? That's combination therapy, and it can help you move better and with less pain. It could also slow or stop joint damage caused by RA. When you first find out you have the condition, you probably start taking one drug, usually methotrexate. If that doesn't give you enough relief, your doctor would add another drug. If your RA is more severe, your doctor may prescribe more than one medication right away. You'll probably take methotrexate as part of combination therapy, plus a similar drug (such as hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, or sulfasalazine), or with a medication called a biologic. Biologics are genetically engineered, and several types of them treat RA. They work on your immune system to curb joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. They can help you move better. It may take some trial and error to find the medicines that together work best for you. Combination therapy can mean less joint pain, morning stiffness, and inflammation. It can also help slow or stop your RA from getting worse. You might be able to have a more active life. Some people go into remission, which means they don't have any joint pain, swelling, or other RA symptoms. The goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms as much as possible without side effects from your medicine. Taking more than one medication can't reverse joint damage that you already have, and it isn't a cure. But it can prevent further damage and help you avoid other health problems that can come with rheumatoid arthritis, like heart attack and stroke."
164,"There are many milestones that need to be achieved when a baby is ready to start to eat solid foods. Here are some of the big ones. Most pediatricians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend introducing solid foods to babies when they are between ages 4 and 6 months. That's when they start to lose the âtongue-thrust reflexâ or extrusion reflex, which is important for sucking the breast or bottle when they are younger, but interferes with feeding. Babies at this point can also lift their heads up independently and hold their necks high. If your baby is around this age, can sit up well with support, and shows interest in the foods he sees you eating, it's probably a good time to venture into feeding your baby solid food. If your baby is exclusively breastfed, it is recommended that you wait until he is 6 months to start solids. â Chunking upâ babies' food is a process -- obviously, they shouldn't go straight from rice cereal to raisin bran. But after the first few weeks of adjusting to eating rather than just drinking his food, your baby should be ready to handle a little more texture in solid foods. Introduce new textures slowly. Good starters are mashed bananas or mashed avocados. You can also use the âstagedâ store-bought baby foods -- going from the smooth puree of stage 1 to the slightly thicker stage 2 and then the chunkier stage 3 by around 9 months of age. ( Babies don't necessarily have to have a lot of teeth to handle more texture in their foods -- they can often gum soft foods very well!) When babies are ready to eat solid foods, they can sit upright with support and hold up their head and neck. They're capable of sitting in a high chair! That's a serious milestone, but you'll need to follow these safety rules: Always buckle a baby into his chair for safety, even if he is unable to get out with the tray in place. As he gets older and becomes more active, he may be able to squirm out. It is a good habit to buckle a child as soon as you place him in his chair -- even if you think there's no chance he could fall out or climb out. You may get distracted for a moment, which happens really easily when we are trying to do a million things at once! Babies between ages 7 and 11 months usually tell you they're ready to eat more grown-up foods by trying to grab them from you. Almost any food that is healthy and nutritious and has a soft texture makes a good finger food, if it's cut small enough: diced pasta; small pieces of well-cooked vegetables such as carrots, peas, or zucchini; and pea-sized bites of chicken or soft meat. Small, unsweetened round cereals and cereal puffs are also a good choice. Avoid feeding your baby grapes, hot dogs (even cut up), nuts, and hard candy, as they are choking hazards. At first babies ârakeâ food into their hand, but soon they develop the âpincer graspâ that allows them to pick up small objects between thumb and forefinger. At that point, your baby can become a pro at self-feeding, so encourage finger foods and let your baby explore! Almost as soon as babies adjust to being fed with a spoon, they'll want to hold and grab the spoon themselves and put it in their mouths. That doesn't mean they're graceful, of course. Most babies don't learn to use a spoon effectively until after their first birthday, but let a younger baby who's interested give it a whirl for practice. Try giving him a soft-tipped spoon to hold while you feed him with another. He can get used to holding the spoon himself and will also be distracted from grabbing yours. When you think he's ready to actually navigate the spoon into his mouth, try thicker, stickier foods like yogurt, mashed potatoes, or cottage cheese. Another tip: Put some cream cheese on the spoon and then a few pieces of O-shaped cereal on top. The cream cheese won't fly everywhere, and the baby can get the experience of actually getting the cereal into his mouth. Expect a mess! Use a plastic or other waterproof bib, and put a mat under the high chair to make cleanup easier. Some pediatricians still recommend waiting until children are at least age 1 before offering them certain foods that are considered highly allergenic, like eggs or fish. But current research doesn't demonstrate any benefit to waiting past a certain age to introduce these foods, unless you have a significant family history of food allergies or other reasons to believe your baby may be predisposed to them. There is no evidence that introducing highly allergenic foods to children under age 1 makes them any more likely to be allergic to them, and the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) now says it's fine to give these foods before the baby's first birthday. Many pediatricians are still very cautious about shellfish and peanuts, however, because allergic reactions to these foods can be particularly dangerous. Babies don't need water during their first 6 months of life. They get all the water they need from breast milk or baby formula. Babies under age 6 months should not be given any water at all, because it's easy to fill up their tiny stomachs -- and they should be filling up on the nutrients they receive from the milk to grow. Once they start eating mostly solid foods, around age 9 months, they can start water with meals using a sippy cup. If your older baby shows an interest in water that you're drinking, there's no harm in letting him have a few sips. Just don't let it replace the nutritious breast milk or formula he should be getting. Mastering eating with utensils is a long process. Most babies do not become really skilled at it until they are well past their first birthday. Encourage your child to practice safely, and again, be prepared for a little mess. ( How else will you get the âoatmeal in the hairâ pictures that will embarrass him years later?)"
165,"When you have gout, your blood has too much uric acid, a substance your body makes when it breaks down food. Over time, the uric acid forms into crystals, which collect around joints. You may not have symptoms at first. But if the area gets inflamed, a gout attack happens, with swelling, redness, and intense pain. When uric acid levels in your blood stay too high, more and more crystals form around your joints. It can turn into a long-term condition, leading to painful and damaged joints. Gout will happen differently for everyone. But signs that it may be getting worse include: Flares happen more often and last longer. Over time, the inflammation causes lasting damage to bone and cartilage. Flare-ups in other parts of your body. About half of people with gout have their first attack in the joint at the base of the big toe. When gout gets worse, it can affect other joints, including the ankle and knee. Bumps form under the skin . Uric acid crystals may start to collect in soft tissue, forming lumps called tophi. They often appear on the hands, fingers, elbows, and ears, but they can show up almost anywhere on the body. Kidney problems. Your kidneys normally get rid of uric acid in your body. But too much of it can also damage the organs. Kidney problems linked with gout -- and signs that gout is getting worse -- include gouty kidney, kidney stones, and kidney failure. If you think your condition is getting worse, talk to your doctor. He will give you medicine to keep your uric acid levels low and to try to prevent future attacks and complications. Allopurinol ( Aloprim, Lopurin, Zyloprim) treats chronic gout by lowering the uric acid produced in your body. Febuxostat ( Uloric) also lowers uric acid production but would be used with caution if you are at risk for heart or blood vessel disease. Once you start taking these medicines, you'll need to take them for life so that your uric acid stays at the right levels. Probenecid and lesinurad ( Zurampic) help the body get rid of more uric acid in your urine. Pegloticase ( Krystexxa) and rasburicase ( Elitek) can break down uric acid into a substance that your body can get rid of. They are only for very severe gout that doesn't get better with usual treatments. Scientists are also testing new treatments for chronic gout. At the same time, researchers are getting a better understanding of how the body makes and breaks down uric acid. Insights from this research could lead to new treatments in the future."
166,"Most of us don't check our kid's blood sugar. So, chances are you don't know if it's healthy. Still, there may be clues that your child's levels are out of whack, and you may want to give your pediatrician a call. If your youngster just had an ice cream sundae, you could probably guess that his blood sugar is high. You might be right. But if he's healthy, his levels will quickly get back to normal. So that kind of spike isn't really a problem. If his blood sugar levels stay up no matter what he has to eat, that's cause for concern. It could signal diabetes. Tip-offs that your child's blood sugar level may be too high include: Constant trips to the bathroom: If it seems like he has to pee all the time, it might be because his body is trying to flush out extra glucose. Extreme thirst: If your youngster is peeing a lot, he's losing a lot of fluids. He may try to get them back by drinking more than usual. Weight loss despite a big appetite: If your child is having trouble using glucose the right way, his body may start breaking down muscle and fat for energy. Feeling tired, moody, or irritable: A tyke that's too tired to play could literally be lacking energy, since his body isn't getting the fuel it needs. Vision problems: High blood sugar can pull fluid from the eye, making it hard to focus. Yeast infections: Yeast thrives on sugar, which may lead to infections in girls and diaper rashes in babies. You might assume that lower blood sugar is better than high. That's true, but only up to a certain point: If blood sugar goes too low, it means your child won't have enough fuel. If it gets really low (your doctor may call it hypoglycemia), your child could have a seizure or even develop brain damage. A child who doesn't have diabetes might have an episode of hypoglycemia because he skipped lunch before soccer practice. It's also possible that a medicine your child takes raises his chances of having low blood sugar. He also could have been born with a condition that affects his metabolism. In any case, unless the cause is clear-cut (like not eating before being active), you should have your child's pediatrician investigate. If your child has low blood sugar, you may notice: Pale or gray skin Moodiness Clumsiness Confusion Your child might tell you that he: Feels shaky or dizzy Gets headaches Struggles to see clearly Sweats even when he's not active Is hungry a lot The skin around his mouth might also tingle, and it might feel like his heart is racing. Severe hypoglycemia can make your child pass out. If that, or a seizure, happens, call for medical help right away."
167,"FALSE Sweet treats -- like candies, pies, cakes -- were once off-limits for people with diabetes. Not anymore. In fact, research has shown that starches like potatoes and white bread affect blood glucose levels much like sugar -- causing sometimes dangerous spikes in blood sugar. Carbohydrates found in most vegetables or whole grains don't affect blood sugar as much. Counting carbs and choosing the healthiest of them is more important than eliminating sugar altogether. A little sweet treat is OK. If you're at a wedding, for instance, you can have a small slice of cake -- very small. Just substitute it for another starchy carb you might eat, like a small potato or a piece of bread. If you really have a sweet tooth, choose desserts, candy, and sodas made with sugar substitutes. Many artificial sweeteners have no carbs or calories, so you don't need to count them in your meal plan. Others have carbohydrates that are absorbed into the blood more slowly than table sugar, so they don't pose a threat to your blood sugar levels. But once you come off sugar and sweeteners for a few weeks, your body and taste buds will adapt, and you won't need or crave as much sweetness. Fruits and other natural foods will taste sweeter and more satisfying. TRUE Within limits, alcohol is OK. But there are exceptions. You shouldn't drink if your blood sugar levels aren't under control or if you have nerve damage from diabetes. If you do drink, keep portions modest: up to one drink a day for women, or up to two drinks a day for men. Remember, one serving is: Five ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor TRUE A high-fiber diet (more than 50 grams/day) can lower blood sugar levels. How? Your body digests fiber-rich foods slowly -- which means glucose (a form of sugar) is absorbed into the blood gradually, helping to control blood sugar levels. You have to eat a very high-fiber diet to attain this effect. High-fiber diets have also been shown to help lower cholesterol levels, lose weight, feel fuller, and stay regular. Fiber-rich foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain bread and crackers, and bran cereal. Always check food labels for carbohydrates and sugars. Many high-fiber foods have sugar added to them. TRUE A high-protein diet can be a problem if you have kidney problems. How much protein is too much? If you have kidney problems, the American Diabetes Association suggests you get just 15% to 20% of your calories from protein. And do your heart a favor: Choose protein such as beans, fish, or chicken more often than fatty cuts of meat. If you want to lose weight, eat a balanced diet that cuts calories by 500 calories a day. You should be able to lose 10% of your body weight without putting your kidneys at risk."
168,"If an insect bite or sting causes a severe reaction, get medical help right away. If you're pregnant, be sure to tell your doctor that, too. For a bite or sting that isn't serious, the main goal is simply to ease pain and discomfort. Try these tips to nurse basic stings and bites at home. General insect bites. Stinging? Burning? Tingling? Soothe them all with an ice cube, a cold washcloth, calamine lotion, a paste of baking soda, or an over-the-counter hydrocortisone ointment. For mosquito or other minor bites, try calamine lotion. Ticks. If you find a tick embedded in your skin, carefully take it out without crushing it. Grip it near the head with tweezers or gloved fingers and pull gently and steadily. Call your doctor and find out if you need to take a medicine to prevent Lyme disease. Watch for a rash. This could indicate Lyme disease, tularemia, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, or another disease. If you develop one, call your doctor. Fire ants. Soak the affected area in ice water and use an anti-itch medicine to calm your skin. If you've been bitten or stung by any of the following (or think you have), call your doctor: Black widow. Your doctor may prescribe pain medicine and/or medications for nausea and muscle spasms. If your reaction is severe, he may also prescribe antivenom. This is a biological product that reverses the effects of the spider's poison. Brown recluse. A spreading wound from this spider should be cleaned and repaired by a doctor. Surgery isn't always needed. Until you can get to a doctor, apply cold packs -- not ice -- to the site. Scorpion. If your symptoms are severe, call 911. Otherwise, see your doctor as soon as you can. He may give you drugs to neutralize the venom or a medication to relieve muscle spasms. The FDA has approved Anascorp, a treatment specifically for scorpion stings."
169,"About 1 in every 4 American adults has high blood pressure, also called hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart and kidney diseases, stroke, and heart failure. High blood pressure is especially dangerous because it often gives no warning signs or symptoms. Fortunately, you can find out if you have high blood pressure by having your blood pressure checked regularly. If it is high, you can take steps to lower it. Just as important, if your blood pressure is normal, you can learn how to keep it from rising. You can prevent high blood pressure by: Maintaining a healthy weight. Being overweight can make you two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure than if you are at your desirable weight. Even small amounts of weight loss can make a big difference in helping to prevent and treat high blood pressure. Getting regular exercise: People who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure -- 20% to 50% lower -- than people who are not active. You don't have to be a marathon runner to benefit from physical activity. Even light activities, if done daily, can help lower your risk. Reducing salt intake: Often, when people with high blood pressure cut back on salt, their blood pressure falls. Cutting back on salt also prevents blood pressure from rising. Drinking alcohol in moderation, if at all: Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. To help prevent high blood pressure, limit how much alcohol you drink to no more than two drinks a day. The "" Dietary Guidelines for Americans"" recommends that for overall health, women should limit their alcohol to no more than one drink a day. Reduce stress: Stress can make blood pressure go up, and over time may contribute to the cause of high blood pressure. There are many steps you can take to reduce your stress. The article on easing stress will get you started. Other nutrients may also help prevent high blood pressure. Here's a roundup of the research: Potassium. Eating foods rich in potassium will help protect some people from developing high blood pressure. You probably can get enough potassium from your diet, so a supplement isn't necessary (and could be dangerous without a doctor's oversight). Many fruits, vegetables, dairy foods, and fish are good sources of potassium. Calcium. Populations with low calcium intakes have high rates of high blood pressure. However, it has not been proven that taking calcium tablets will prevent high blood pressure. But it is important to be sure to get at least the recommended amount of calcium -- 1,000 milligrams per day for adults 19 to 50 years old and 1,200 mg for those over 50 (pregnant and breastfeeding women also need more) -- from the foods you eat. Dairy foods like low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources of calcium. Low-fat and nonfat dairy products have even more calcium than the high-fat types. Magnesium. A diet low in magnesium may make your blood pressure rise. But doctors don't recommend taking extra magnesium to help prevent high blood pressure -- the amount you get in a healthy diet is enough. Magnesium is found in whole grains, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and dry peas and beans. Fish oils. A type of fat called ""omega-3 fatty acids"" is found in fatty fish like mackerel and salmon. Large amounts of fish oils may help reduce high blood pressure, but their role in prevention is unclear. Taking fish oil pills is not routinely recommended, primarily because it is unclear whether supplements can make a difference; getting omega 3's as part of a heart healthy diet is best. Most fish, if not fried or made with added fat, is low in saturated fat and calories and can be eaten often. Garlic. There has been some evidence to suggest garlic's effect in lowering blood pressure, in addition to improving cholesterol and reducing some cancers. Further research is being conducted to fully assess garlic's potential health benefits. Always talk to your doctor before taking a dietary supplement or alternative herbal treatment. Some may interact with other medications you may be taking or have harmful side effects."
170,"See your doctor right away if you fall and hurt your shoulder. If it's broken, quick treatment can speed your recovery. First, your doctor will carefully check the injury to see where and how bad it is. So expect a physical exam and an X-ray. After that, you may need to get a CT scan, which is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. Your doctor will then suggest a treatment plan. It depends on the location of your break. Your shoulder is made up of three bones, and a fracture usually involves one of them: Shoulder blade (scapula) Collarbone (clavicle) Arm bone (humerus) Here's what to expect with each kind of fracture: Shoulder blade. It's protected by your chest and layers of muscle, so a fracture there isn't that common. But if you do break it, you probably won't need surgery. Instead, your doctor will give you a sling that holds your arm in place and keeps it still while the bone heals. You can also expect a prescription for pain medicine and instructions to apply ice. If the break is in both the shoulder blade and another part of your shoulder, you may need an operation. A surgeon uses plates and screws to put the bones into place and hold them together. Collarbone. It usually heals without surgery. Your doctor may fit you with a sling to hold your arm still. If the bone comes through the skin, or if it's fractured in more than one place, you may need an operation. Just like with shoulder surgery, your doctor will need to hold it together with plates, screws, or pins. Arm bone. It's the area closest to your shoulder. A break there can heal without surgery if the bones haven't shifted apart. You'll need to wear a sling while it heals. If the break is serious, a surgeon will put in pins, plates, and screws. In some cases, you might need a total shoulder replacement. Your shoulder has a lot of work to do in order to heal. First, the bones have to grow back together just right. Then they need to regain their strength. Finally, they must be able to work like they used to. To help your shoulder accomplish all those tasks, your doctor may refer you to a specialist like one of these: Physiatrist, a doctor trained in nerve, muscle, and bone recovery Physical therapist, who uses movement and exercises to help you get your shoulder back to normal Occupational therapist, who helps you do your day-to-day activities as you heal Your risk of breaking a bone is greater after a fracture, so take extra care. Your doctor will go over ways to avoid falls. For instance, he may suggest you: Keep good posture. Avoid risky activities. Do bone-strengthening exercises."
171,"For thousands of years, people have used the gel from aloe vera leaves for healing and softening the skin. In fact, aloe has also long been a folk treatment for many maladies, including constipation and skin disorders. Modern-day research into aloe vera's benefits is mixed, with some evidence showing it can cause cancer in lab animals. There are no foods that contain aloe vera, so it must be taken in supplement or gel form. Some forms of aloe vera are safer to take than others, and chronic use is discouraged. Research backs up the ancient use of topical aloe vera as a skin treatment, at least for specific conditions. Studies have shown that aloe gel might be effective in treating psoriasis, seborrhea, dandruff, and minor burns and skin abrasions, as well as radiation-induced skin injuries. Aloe gel also seems helpful in treating the sores caused by genital herpes in men. There's also strong evidence that aloe juice, which contains latex, taken by mouth is a powerful laxative. In fact, aloe juice was once sold in over-the-counter constipation drugs. However, because aloe's safety was not well-established, the FDA ordered in 2002 that over-the-counter laxatives containing aloe vera either be reformulated or removed from store shelves. Aloe vera gel taken orally (by mouth) seems to help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. It may also help to lower cholesterol. The results of aloe vera studies for other medical conditions have been less clear. Creams and gels with aloe vera vary in dosage. Some creams for minor burns have just 0.5% aloe vera. Others used for psoriasis may contain as much as 70% aloe vera. As an oral supplement, aloe has no set dose. For constipation, some use 100-200 milligrams of aloe juice -- or 50 milligrams of aloe extract -- daily as needed. For diabetes, 1 tablespoon of the gel has been used daily. High oral doses of aloe or aloe latex are dangerous. Ask your doctor for advice on how to use aloe. Researchers warn against the chronic use of aloe vera; however, if the aloe product is free of aloin -- an extract of the plant that has been found to cause colorectal cancer in rats -- it may be OK as a topical remedy for sunburn. Aloin is found between the outer leaf of the aloe plant and the gooey stuff inside. Side effects. Topical aloe vera might cause skin irritation. Oral aloe, which has a laxative effect, can cause cramping and diarrhea. This may cause electrolyte imbalances in the blood of people who ingest aloe for more than a few days. It can also stain the colon, thus making it difficult to visualize the colon during a colonoscopy. So avoid it for a month before having a colonoscopy. Aloe gel, for topical or oral use, should be free of aloin, which can be irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. Risks. Do not apply topical aloe vera to deep cuts or severe burns. People allergic to garlic, onions, and tulips are more likely to be allergic to aloe. High doses of oral aloe are dangerous. Don't take oral aloe if you have intestinal problems, heart disease, hemorrhoids, kidney problems, diabetes, or electrolyte imbalances. Interactions. If you take any drugs regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using aloe supplements. They could interact with medicines and supplements like diabetes drugs, heart drugs, laxatives, steroids, and licorice root. The oral use of aloe vera gel may also block the absorption of medicines taken at the same time. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, aloe vera supplements should not be used orally by children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."

When you're pregnant with one baby, get about 300 extra calories per day starting in your 2nd trimester. You'll need more than that if you're having twins or multiples, so check with your doctor. Put on the extra pounds slowly and steadily. But don't sweat it if the number on your scale shoots up once and then you level out. Work with your doctor to meet your weight goals. Gain too many pounds and you become more likely to get high blood pressure or diabetes. Your chances of delivering your baby early or needing a C-section also go up. Your doctor can guide you through the whole 9 months. Call her with any weight concerns or questions you have. if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Eating a healthy, balanced diet will help your baby get the nutrients he or she needs and grow at a healthy rate. But how many extra calories do you really need? Though you do need some extra calories, it's not necessary to ''eat for two.'' The average pregnant woman needs only about 300 healthy calories more a day than she did before she was pregnant. This will help her gain the right amount of weight during pregnancy. Ask your health care provider how much weight you should gain. A woman who was average weight before getting pregnant should gain 25 to 35 pounds after becoming pregnant. Underweight women should gain 28 to 40 pounds. And overweight women may need to gain only 15 to 25 pounds during pregnancy. In general, you should gain about 2 to 4 pounds during the first three months you're pregnant and 1 pound a week during the rest of your pregnancy. If you are expecting twins you should gain 35 to 45 pounds during your pregnancy. This would be an average of 1 ½ pounds per week after the usual weight gain in the first three months. It's especially important to gain the right amount of weight when you're expecting twins because your weight affects the babies' weight. And because twins are often born before the due date, a higher birth weight is important for their health. When carrying twins, you may need between 3,000 and 3,500 calories a day. Baby: 8 pounds Placenta: 2-3 pounds Amniotic fluid: 2-3 pounds Breast tissue: 2-3 pounds Blood supply: 4 pounds Stored fat for delivery and breastfeeding: 5-9 pounds Larger uterus: 2-5 pounds Total: 25-35 pounds If a woman is very overweight when she gets pregnant, her doctor may want her to lose weight. She should only lose weight under her doctor's care. But in most cases, women should not try to lose weight or diet during pregnancy. If your health care provider wants you to gain weight while you're pregnant, try these tips: Eat five to six small meals every day. Keep quick, easy snacks on hand, such as nuts, raisins, cheese and crackers, dried fruit, and ice cream or yogurt. Spread peanut butter on toast, crackers, apples, bananas, or celery. One tablespoon of creamy peanut butter gives you about 100 calories and 7 grams of protein. Add nonfat powdered milk to mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and hot cereal. Add extras to your meal, such as butter or margarine, cream cheese, gravy, sour cream, and cheese. If you have gained more weight than your doctor recommended, talk to your doctor about it. In most cases, you'll want to wait until after delivery to lose weight. Here are some tips to slow your weight gain: When eating fast food, choose lower-fat items such as broiled chicken breast sandwich with tomato and lettuce (no sauce or mayonnaise), side salad with low-fat dressing, plain bagels, or a plain baked potato. Avoid foods such as French fries, mozzarella sticks, or breaded chicken patties. Avoid whole milk products. You need at least four servings of milk products every day. However, using skim, 1%, or 2% milk will greatly reduce the amount of calories and fat you eat. Also, choose low-fat or fat-free cheese or yogurt. Limit sweet or sugary drinks. Sweetened drinks such as soft drinks, fruit punch, fruit drinks, iced tea, lemonade, or powdered drink mixes have lots of empty calories. Choose water, club soda, or mineral water to skip extra calories. Don't add salt to foods when cooking. Salt causes you to retain water. Limit sweets and high-calorie snacks. Cookies, candies, donuts, cakes, syrup, honey, and potato chips have a lot of calories and little nutrition. Try not to eat these foods every day. Instead, try fresh fruit, low-fat yogurt, angel food cake with strawberries, or pretzels as lower-calorie snack and dessert choices. Use fats in moderation. Fats include cooking oils, margarine, butter, gravy, sauces, mayonnaise, regular salad dressings, sauces, lard, sour cream, and cream cheese. Try lower-fat alternatives. Cook food the healthy way. Frying foods in oil or butter will add calories and fat. Baking, broiling, grilling, and boiling are healthier preparation methods. Exercise. Moderate exercise can help burn excess calories. Walking or swimming is usually safe for pregnant women. Ask your health care provider what exercise would be right for you before getting started."

They include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix. It's usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection ( STI), like chlamydia or gonorrhea, and is treated with antibiotics. You might not notice any symptoms of PID early on. But as the infection gets worse, you can have: Pain in your lower belly and pelvis Heavy discharge from your vagina with an unpleasant odor Bleeding between periods Pain during sex Fever and chills Pain when you pee or a hard time going Call your doctor right away if you have any of these. PID can cause serious problems if it's not treated. For example, you might have trouble getting pregnant or have pain in your pelvic area that doesn't go away. In some cases, PID can bring on more intense symptoms, and you'll need to go to the emergency room. Get medical help right away if you have: Severe pain in your lower belly Signs of shock, like fainting Vomiting Fever higher than 101 F Some of these also can be signs of other serious medical conditions, like appendicitis or an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that happens in a fallopian tube outside the womb). You would need medical help right away for these as well. Treating an STI right away can help keep you from getting PID. Symptoms of STI are a lot like those of PID. They include heavy discharge from your vagina with an unpleasant odor, pain when you pee, and bleeding between periods. Call your doctor as soon as you notice any of these to lower your chances of PID."
174,"Does your mate toss and turn? Then you're probably not sleeping well, either. Lost sleep can take a toll on how you feel during the day and also on your relationship. Those are good reasons to start taking action, so you both have restful nights. The first step is to figure out why your partner isn't sleeping well. He may have already tried doing the most obvious things, such as: Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, allowing for 7 to 9 hours of sleep. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, restful, and comfortable. Limit alcohol and caffeine. Take time to relax before going to bed. If sleep problems still keep happening, it may be time to see a doctor. Snoring, for instance, is common and often harmless. But it can be due to obstructive sleep apnea, which causes people to stop breathing briefly during sleep. Likewise, insomnia often happens for simple reasons, like stress or jet lag. But it can also be a symptom of another medical condition, such as heart disease or depression. Simple lifestyle changes can make a difference with many sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea. Exercise daily for at least 20 minutes. Try to finish up at least 4 to 5 hours before you go to bed. It leads to better sleep. Eat dinner several hours before you and your partner go to bed. Switch to decaf drinks and skip alcohol. Don't smoke. Nicotine is a stimulant. Make your bedroom better. Save it for sleep and sex. You'll both sleep better if you keep your room cool and dark overnight. You can help quiet the noise. Since many people snore the most when they lay on their backs, gently nudge your partner to roll onto his side and prop a pillow behind him. Handy with a needle and thread? You could try another fix. Sew a small pocket of cloth onto the back of a pajama top or T-shirt. Put a small ping pong ball in the pocket, and sew it shut. Because the ball won't be comfortable, your partner will want to sleep on their side, which usually means less snoring. Has a doctor prescribed a CPAP (continuous positive air pressure) machine? Encourage your mate to use it. If the CPAP machine's noise keeps you up, consider moving the base unit somewhere else in the room. You can also use a white noise machine or wear earplugs."
175,"Bee stings, cobra venom, and hookworms are things you usually avoid -- unless you have multiple sclerosis. Then, you might be willing to try them to help ease your symptoms. And what if recycling stem cells or going gluten-free could fix your immune system? Would you give it a go? Let's separate the science from the wishful thinking. Some lifestyle approaches, such as exercise, have been proven to help with fatigue, depression, memory, and bladder control. Others, such as vitamin D supplements, show promise but are still being tested. Acupuncture, a centuries-old form of Chinese medicine, shows mixed results. Your best bet is to stick to your treatment plan. Don't stop taking your medication. Talk to your doctor about any complementary medicine or alternative treatment you want to try, especially since it may affect how your drugs work. Together, you can decide if it makes sense and won't do more harm than good. The goal behind a hematopoietic stem cell transplant is to reboot your immune system to stop it from attacking your nervous system. Researchers take special undeveloped cells from the blood or bone marrow of people with MS, then knock out their immune cells with low doses of chemotherapy and radiation. When the saved stem cells get put back into their bodies, they start making new immune cells that hopefully won't go after myelin and brain tissue. The results are promising: 41 of the people studied for 2 years said their symptoms were greatly improved. After 4 years, more than half of them had no relapses. That was 80% of those in the study. Larger, controlled studies and clinical trials are now underway. In some people, the protein found in wheat can trigger celiac disease. That's also an autoimmune disorder. But research doesn't show a link between it and MS. Unless you're sensitive to gluten, don't pass on the pasta and bread just yet. There's no science to suggest giving up these kinds of foods will ease your MS symptoms. You may have seen this in movies when scuba divers get ""the bends."" You sit in a small, sealed chamber breathing pure oxygen. Because the pressure inside is up to three times more than normal air pressure outside, you can breathe more into your lungs. This extra oxygen may help your body heal. It works as a treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning, bubbles in your bloodstream, burns from fire and heat, and wounds from diabetes and radiation. But not for MS. Several studies found no evidence to support its use and little need for more research. Ancient Greek and Egyptian medical writing tells of bees used as medicine (apitherapy). Melittin, found in bee venom, supposedly brings down inflammation related to MS. But one study shows that it doesn't. What's more, bee sting therapy could be dangerous if you have a life-threatening reaction to bee venom. Skip bee pollen, too. Although it's rich with nutrients, it hasn't been shown to help MS symptoms. And it can also trigger a severe allergic reaction. Bottom line? Bees don't stand up to 21st-century studies. Can the cobratoxin in snake venom slow down the immune system and help with MS? That's the belief. Unfortunately, the answer is no. While you can find stories of people who say that cobra venom helps ease MS symptoms, you won't find scientific evidence to support it. Hookworms are tiny worms that can live in your small intestine and cause problems with your gut, including pain, diarrhea, and anemia. These intestinal parasites might also be able to stop the immune system from overreacting. One small study of 12 people with MS found that those who were infected with hookworms had fewer lesions than those who weren't infected. In 2012, researchers in the UK began recruiting people with MS for a study to see if hookworms could alter the course of MS. Watch for results in the next several years. A hypnotherapist can teach you to relax so deeply that you're open to suggestions for dealing with pain. This mind-body practice has helped ease MS pain in a few, very small studies. You may find hypnotherapy calming, but what affect it has on MS symptoms isn't clear. Larger studies are needed to find out whether the relief is actually a placebo effect. This form of energy healing may help boost your body's ability to heal itself. It often includes light touching. Some people find massage in general can soothe stress and be relaxing, but there are no studies that show Reiki eases MS symptoms. That being said, Reiki is generally safe. And some research shows that it helps ease pain and anxiety for people who have cancer."
176,"Pasta, steak, cheese, ice cream ... you can eat what you want on this popular weight-loss plan. Formerly called Weight Watchers, the company has changed its name to WW, with the tagline â Wellness that Works.â The basic principle of eating what you love remains, though the program steers you toward healthier foods with its points system. In its program called WW Freestyle, you can roll over some of your points to another day. And there are also more than 200 âzero-pointâ foods that you don't need to track at all. Those items include beans, chicken breast (skinless), eggs, and fish. It isn't so much a diet as a lifestyle-change program. It can help you learn how to eat healthier and get more physical activity. You can follow the plan online on your own. You'll track your food choices and exercise, chart progress, and find recipes and workouts. There's a coaching option if you prefer one-on-one consultations by phone, email, and text. Or you can go to in-person group meetings where you'll weigh in. A Consumer Reports survey found that people who went to meetings were more satisfied with the program and lost more weight than people who used only the online tools. No food is forbidden when you follow this plan, which doesn't make you buy any prepackaged meals. WW assigns different foods a Smart Points value. Nutritious foods that fill you up have fewer points than junk with empty calories. The eating plan factors sugar, fat, and protein into its points calculations to steer you toward fruits, veggies, and lean protein, and away from stuff that's high in sugar and saturated fat. You'll have a Smart Points target that's set up based on your body and goals. As long as you stay within your daily target, you can spend those Smart Points however you'd like, even on alcohol or dessert, or save them to use another day. But healthier, lower-calorie foods cost fewer points. And some items now have 0 points. WW is designed to make it easier to change your habits long-term, and it's flexible enough that you should be able to adapt it to your life. You'll tweak your eating and lifestyle patterns -- many of which you may have had for years -- and you'll create new ones. How much effort it takes depends on how much you'll have to change your habits. Cooking and shopping: Expect to learn how to shop, cook healthy foods, and dine out in ways that support your weight loss goal without skimping on taste or needing to buy unusual foods. Packaged foods or meals: Not required. In-person meetings: Optional. Exercise: You'll get a personalized activity goal and access to the program's app that tracks Fit Points. You get credit for all of your activity. Because you choose how you spend your Smart Points, you can still do WW if you're a vegetarian, vegan, have other preferences, or if you need to limit salt or fat. Cost: WW offers three plans: Online only, online with meetings, or online with one-on-one coaching through phone calls and messages. Check the WW website for the pricing for the online-only and online-with meetings options (you'll need to enter your ZIP code). Prices and offers may vary. Support: Besides the optional in-person meetings (now called wellness workshops) and personal coaching, WW has an app, online community, a magazine, and a website with recipes, tips, success stories, and more. You can also sign up online for a newsletter or use WW Connect, a community available through the WW app. Does It Work? WW is one of the most well-researched weight loss programs available. And yes, it works. Many studies have shown that the plan can help you lose weight and keep it off. For instance, a study from The American Journal of Medicine showed that people doing WW lost more weight than those trying to drop pounds on their own. WW ranked 1st both for â Best Weight Loss Dietâ and for â Best Commercial Diet Planâ in the 2018 rankings from U. S. News & World Report. Overall, it's an excellent, easy-to-follow program. Is It Good for Certain Conditions? WW is good for anyone. But its focus on nutritious, low-calorie foods makes it great for people with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and even heart disease. If you choose any premade meals, check the labels, as some may be high in sodium. Work with your doctor so they can check your progress, too. This is especially important for people with diabetes, as you may need to adjust your medicine as you lose weight. The Final Word If the thought of weighing your food or counting calories make your head spin, this is an ideal program because it does the work for you. The online tool assigns a certain number value to each food, even restaurant foods, to make it easy to stay on track. If you don't know your way around the kitchen, the premade meals and snacks make it easy. They're a quick and easy way to control portion sizes and calories. You don't have to drop any foods from your diet, but you will have to limit portion sizes to cut back on calories. The emphasis on fruits and veggies means the diet is high in fiber, which helps keep you full. And the program is simple to follow, making it easier to stick to. You can also find WW's premade meals at your local grocery store. A big advantage of WW is their website. They offer comprehensive information on dieting, exercise, cooking, and fitness tips, as well as online support groups. Be prepared to spend some money to get the full benefits of the robust program. It can be a bit costly, but it's well worth it to reap the health perks of losing weight and keeping it off."
177,"If you think you have erectile dysfunction, or ED, you're bound to have questions for your doctor about what's happening and how to fix it. Lots of men have been there. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor and ask him any and all questions you might have that can start you on the road to getting a solution. Here are the first six questions you should definitely ask: Erectile dysfunction is when you're unable to get and maintain an erection. If you have trouble with ED every once in a while, it's probably nothing to worry about. But if it happens frequently or on a regular basis, it could be a sign of other health problems. No matter how often you experience ED, it can affect your relationship and cause issues with self-esteem. But it's also very common and, if you talk to your doctor, treatable. There are a lot of reasons you can get ED, from high blood pressure and diabetes to alcohol and drug use to a hormone imbalance. It could even be due to an injury to your penis, prostate, bladder, and pelvis. But it's not always physical. Psychological and emotional issues are sometimes to blame, as well. Stress, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem can cause ED. Even nervousness about how you perform sexually can make it happen. Some medications may make getting an erection difficult, too. Your doctor can help you figure out what's going on and how to solve it. Age does appear to play a role in ED. The older you get, it may take you longer to get an erection, and it may not be as firm as it was when you were younger. But getting older does not cause ED, it only increases your chances of getting it. In fact, ED can affect men of all ages. A recent study showed 1 in 4 patients going to the doctor for the first time for ED was under age 40. And almost half of them had severe ED when compared to older patients. The younger patients smoked cigarettes and used illicit drugs more than the older men, as well. You'll probably only need a physical and to talk to your doctor about your medical history. But if you have other health problems that could be the cause of your ED, you may want to see a specialist, usually a urologist, for a consultation that could include: Blood tests Mental health exam Overnight erection test Ultrasound of your penis to check blood flow Urinalysis Every situation is different, so your doctor will focus on the specific condition that could be causing your ED. Your treatment could include: Medications. There are several different ED medicines that can help produce an erection, such as avanafil ( Stendra), sildenafil ( Viagra), tadalafil ( Cialis), and vardenafil ( Levitra). These medications work the same way: they relax smooth muscle and allow increased blood flow into the penis. Testosterone replacement and medications injected directly into your penis to help with erection are also common. Treating underlying causes. Your doctor might recommend you make certain lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and drinking, and adding exercise to your daily routine. He may also swap medications that could be contributing to your ED with ones that won't have that side effect. Talking to a counselor for psychological, emotional, or relationship issues might also help. Other options. Surgery and penis pumps are also treatment options you can discuss with your doctor if medication doesn't work. Penile implants and blood vessel surgery come with risks, so they're usually considered as last options. Check your policy's details. It depends on the type of treatment you're getting and your insurance coverage. If your ED is due to a medical condition, insurance will usually cover at least some of it. Treatments like sex therapy that have not yet been approved by the FDA may not be covered. When in doubt, call your insurer."
178,"Just about everyone has some acne as teenagers. Sometimes it lasts much longer than that. Even grown men can have it. But there are treatments, even for severe acne decades after you finished high school. For most people, changes in hormone levels trigger acne. These hormones create oils that can lead to clogged pores, which sometimes let bacteria grow. Both of these problems cause breakouts. Men whose fathers had severe acne are more likely to have it, too. Some medications such as lithium, which treats bipolar disorder, and corticosteroids like prednisone can also bring on acne. Men often get acne on the face and back. Sweating can make it worse. Breakouts on the back often happen in hot weather or after exercising. They're harder to control than the kind on your face. But fewer people see your back. Some men get shaving bumps that look like acne, but ingrown hairs or shaving mistakes are the real cause. Keep your skin clean. Many cleansers are available. In general, avoid products with beads in them, because they can irritate your skin. Wash twice a day. Use a fresh washcloth that's gentle on your skin. When you shave, use a clean razor every time. You might want to use an over-the-counter product with benzoyl peroxide, retinol, or salicylic acid. Your doctor can prescribe an antibiotic foam that you can mix with your shaving cream to help prevent breakouts. If shaving bumps are a problem for you, try an electric razor, and don't shave too closely. When you shower, use a cleansing brush with an extension to wash hard-to-reach areas on your back. A sonic cleansing system with a changeable brush head is another option. Benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid products can help control acne on your back. You don't need a prescription for them. But go easy, because these can be drying. A white, cotton tee-shirt is the best thing to have closest to your skin. If you've tried at-home treatments for 4-8 weeks and your acne won't go away, it may be time to see a dermatologist. At your appointment, your dermatologist will check your skin and recommend a treatment plan. You might need a prescription for antibiotics, prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, or a type of drug called retinoids. If your acne is severe, your dermatologist may consider a drug called isotretinoin. Women who plan to get pregnant must avoid this drug, because it can cause birth defects. But men don't need to take extra precautions to avoid getting their partner pregnant. There are also high-tech options. One of them is a laser skin treatment, and another is light therapy combined with vacuum therapy. These can be expensive, and your insurance may not cover them, so check first."
179,"Seek emergency care if: There is pain, change in vision, or increased sensitivity to light after a scratch or trauma to the eyeball. There is a foreign object lodged in the eye or eyelid or under the eyelid. There is loss of vision. Something hit the eye at high speed or with high force. Inspect the eye for small particles that may be stuck under the eyelid and causing symptoms. Flush the eye with clean water or saline solution once or twice to remove any particles or to soothe the eye surface. Do not rinse the eye more than a few times. Doing so can make the situation worse. Avoid rubbing or pressing on the eye. Get medical help if: The person has blurred vision or eye pain, tearing, redness, light sensitivity, irritation, or difficulty opening the eye, even if there does not appear to be something in the eye. There may be a scratch on the surface of the eye called a corneal abrasion. If you see a health care provider: The health care provider will examine the eye for damage, remove any particles, and check the vision. Antibiotic ointment or pain relievers may be prescribed. Small, surface corneal abrasions heal in a couple of days. Pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) can be taken for pain. Avoid ibuprofen and other NSAIDs if the person has heart failure or kidney failure. For larger abrasions, care from an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) may be needed and a bandage contact lens may be placed to aid with comfort and healing."
180,"Do you have white patches in your mouth? What about redness and swelling? You may have oral lichen planus. It's a long-lasting disease that affects your mouth. It doesn't go away, but you can keep it under control. Anybody can get it. Women are more likely to have it than men. It's most common in people older than 40. But kids and young adults can also get it. Doctors aren't sure what causes oral lichen planus. It may run in your family. And it could be linked to your immune system. Most of the time your immune cells keep you safe by attacking bacteria and viruses. With oral lichen planus, some doctors believe those cells get confused and attack the lining of your mouth. Other possible triggers include medicines like painkillers, high blood pressure treatments, diabetes drugs, and malaria medications. It may also be a reaction to metal, such as dental fillings. It could be triggered by other mouth problems such as having a rough crown or a habit of biting your cheeks or tongue. There's also a chance that it's linked to hepatitis C. Many people infected with the virus get it. What is certain is that oral lichen planus isn't contagious. You can't pass it to anyone else and you didn't catch it from someone. Symptoms can come on slowly or start all at once. You may start out with dryness or a metallic, burning taste in your mouth. Then you'll see white patches on your tongue, cheeks, and gums. They can be tiny dots or lines that make a lace-like pattern. You may also have redness and swelling. Sometimes, there's peeling or blistering. These sores can be burning and painful. They'll likely hurt the most when you eat or drink foods that are spicy, salty, acidic (orange juice, tomatoes), or alcoholic. Crispy treats and drinks with caffeine can also cause problems. Your doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by taking a small piece of skin from inside your mouth. This is called a biopsy. He'll run tests on it in the lab to see what the problem is. You may also need blood tests to rule out other conditions. If you only feel a slight roughness in your mouth, you may not need treatment. If you're in pain or have sores, your doctor may suggest a corticosteroid cream. In rare cases, he might prescribe steroid pills. Watch what you eat and drink. Certain foods and drinks -- especially spicy or citrus ones -- can make your symptoms worse. Hot or cold foods and drinks can also make you more uncomfortable. Stress can also make things worse. Get rid of any problems that could trigger oral lichen planus or make it worse: Have your dentist polish sharp teeth or replace damaged fillings or crowns. Talk to your doctor about changing medications that may be to blame. Brush twice a day and floss daily. See your dentist twice a year for a cleaning and check-up. Use a mild toothpaste and a soft toothbrush. You also need to keep track of your symptoms and tell your doctor about any changes in your mouth. There's a slight chance that oral lichen planus can lead to oral cancer. Make sure to get a screening for oral cancer every 6 to 12 months. It's also important to enjoy a diet rich in fruit and vegetables. If you smoke, quit. Don't drink large amounts of alcohol. See your doctor regularly to look for any changes in your mouth."

182,"When you have a child with type 1 diabetes, meal planning is important. Everything your child eats can affect his blood sugar. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can help you come up with the best plan for your child, but there's information all parents of kids with this condition should know. Good Nutrition Like all children, kids with type 1 diabetes need nutrient-rich foods that help them grow and keep them at a healthy weight. Over the course of a day, your child should get about 10%-20% of his calories from protein, 25%-30% calories from healthy fats, and about 50%-60% from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates Carbs are found in most foods -- not just bread and potatoes. They supply the energy that the body and brain need to work their best. Steer your child toward complex carbs such as vegetables and whole grains. They have vitamins and minerals that will keep him healthy, and fiber, which helps control blood sugar levels. Try to stay away from simple carbs, like white bread and pasta and other processed grains, candy and frosting. They can raise blood sugar quickly. The amount of carbs your child needs depends on his weight, age, size, exercise level, and any medicines he's taking. Your doctor or dietitian can help you figure out the number of grams or serving sizes your child should have each day. Carb Counting Many families keep their child's blood sugar levels steady by counting the number of carbohydrates eaten at every meal or snack, then adjusting insulin doses for it. On packaged foods, the number of total carbs per serving is listed on the label. You can subtract the grams of dietary fiber since this isn't digested. Then multiply the total by how many servings of that food your child eats. If you're cooking at home or eating out, you can look up carb counts and portion sizes of foods online. Constant Carbohydrate Plan Another option is to have your child eat a set amount of carbohydrates at every meal and snack. He'll need to eat at the same times every day, and also take insulin at set times. You don't have to eat the same foods everyday. You just need to stick to the total carbs set for each meal and snack. Keeping to a schedule works well for many kids. Exchange Meal Plan With an âexchange plan,â your child's menu will include the amount he can eat from six different food groups: starch, fruit, milk, fat, vegetable, and meat. One food can be exchanged for another with the same amount of calories, protein, carbs, and fats. In children with type 1, dietitians often will focus on carb exchanges since this affects blood sugars the most. You can find exchange lists online. Foods To Avoid There are no specific foods that are off-limits to your child, but there are things to consider when meal planning and grocery shopping. People with diabetes have a higher risk of developing heart disease. Because of that, it's good to steer your child away from fatty foods that contain cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fat. Avoid foods high in salt. Eating too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure. Limit sugary foods like candy, cookies, frosting, or soda that raise blood sugar quickly. They're best given at a meal and with insulin. You'll adjust insulin based on carb counting. Your child doesn't have to miss out on treats for special occasions like birthdays or Halloween. You'll just have to account for those carbs over the course of the day. Snacks to Keep on Hand â Freeâ snacks like cucumbers and celery or sugar-free gelatin contain very few carbs, so they won't have much effect on your child's blood sugar. You can also have âcontrolled-carb snacksâ handy to for between meals. Some good kid-friendly choices: low-fat string cheese, a hard-boiled egg, or a small serving of nuts with a sugar-free drink. Highs and Lows If your child eats more than expected or at a different time than you've planned, he may get high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia. If this happens, you may need to make some adjustments. Talk to your diabetes team about adjusting his meal plan or his doses of insulin or other medication. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can cause serious problems that need treatment right away. Your child's glucose levels can drop if he skips a meal or snack or doesn't eat as many carbs as expected. It can also happen if he takes his insulin at the wrong time or exercises more than usual without eating extra snacks or adjusting his insulin. If your child's levels are low, give him a sugary food. Regular soda, orange juice, or even cake frosting raise glucose levels quickly. You can also keep glucose tablets on hand or talk to your doctor about a glucagon kit. Glucagon is a hormone that treats a severe low blood sugar reaction. Keep Track Keep a record of your child's carb intake, insulin doses, and blood sugar readings. These numbers can help you and your doctor see if his meal plan is working."
183,"If a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or an injury has harmed your elbow, your doctor may recommend surgery to replace the joint, so you have less pain and can move better. During elbow replacement, a surgeon replaces your elbow with an artificial joint made from two implants that attach to the bones in your arm. A metal and plastic hinge joins the implants together. The procedure is similar to hip and knee replacements. You want a surgeon who has a lot of experience. Ask your rheumatologist or other doctor for referrals. You may also want to check with the professional association of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons. The most common complications are: Infection Injury to nerves and blood vessels Allergic reaction to the artificial joint Broken bone Stiffness or instability of the joint Loosening or wearing of the artificial parts Weakness or failure in the tendons of your arm Pain There are risks because of the anesthesia, such as an allergic reaction to those medicines and breathing problems. As with any surgery, bleeding and blood clots are possible, too. Your doctor will ask you about your medical history. Tell them about any conditions you have, including allergies. Also let your doctor know if you drink alcohol and what medicines you take. She also needs to know about any vitamins, supplements, or herbal products you use. If you smoke, you should stop before your surgery. Elbow replacement surgery takes about 2 hours. You'll get anesthesia, so you won't be âawakeâ for it. You'll need to stay in the hospital for up to 4 days. After the operation, you'll have stitches and a bandage on your new elbow. You may also need to keep your arm in a splint to keep it stable while it heals. Because elbow replacement involves cutting skin, tendons, and bone, you'll need strong pain medications after surgery. You'll also take pain meds for 1 to 2 weeks after you go home from the hospital. It will take time to get used to your new elbow. For instance, you won't be able to lift anything heavier than a cup of coffee for 6 weeks after surgery. It's a good idea to line up help ahead of time. You'll learn simple exercises and other types of physical therapy to help your arm get stronger and move better. You'll do ârange of motionâ exercises, such as bending and straightening your arm. Elbow replacement usually reduces pain and helps your elbow work better. But it may not make the joint as good as it was before disease or injury hurt it. You'll need to avoid activities that can cause further injury, such as hammering, playing contact sports, and lifting heavy weights. With good care, your new elbow should serve you well for many years."
184,"Every year, millions of people break bones in their hands. Because we are so dependent on our hands, even a small loss of function can result in a lifelong disability. A broken hand will often require a visit to a doctor, and it may require months of rehabilitation care. The hand is composed of 27 bones, including those in the wrist. Broken bones most commonly result from a direct blow to the hand or a fall onto the hand. Common injuries include fractures of the fingertip, or of the pinkie side of the palm, or of the thumb. When doctors describe the bones in the hand, they use several terms. Carpals are the 8 bones in the wrist. They are not actually part of the hand but are vital for its function. Metacarpals are the 5 bones that form the palm of the hand. Phalanges are the 14 small bones that, when strung together, form the thumb and fingers. The thumb has 2 phalanges. The other 4 fingers are made of 3 phalanges each. The knuckles of the hand are referred to as the MCP joint, which stands for metacarpal-phalangeal joint (because the fingers, composed of phalanges, join the palm, made of metacarpals). The joints in the fingers are called the PIP and DIP joints. The PIP joint is the proximal interphalangeal joint and is the joint closest to the palm. The DIP joint is the distal interphalangeal joint and is the joint closest to the fingertip. The fingers are called the thumb, index finger, middle (or long) finger, ring finger, and pinky (or small) finger. The handedness (right or left) of the person is called the dominance of the hand. If you are left-handed, then you are left-hand dominant. The most common causes of hand injuries include workplace injuries, improper use of tools, crush injuries, falls, and sports injuries. The vast majority of injuries can be prevented. Most injuries of the hand are fairly obvious. The symptoms may include the following: A history of injury Swelling Bruising Pain Misalignment of the fingers Weakness Inability to grasp Reduced range of motion of fingers Your hands are central to being able to function, and you should be certain that no permanent damage has been done. Because your hands are so important, a doctor should see any hand injury, except the most minor. Contact your doctor, who may refer you to the emergency department for diagnosis and treatment. Most injuries of the hand will require an X-ray. The history of how the hand was injured will help the doctor determine the most likely fracture. For example, if the hand was injured by punching, the most likely fracture is that of the fifth metacarpal. The doctor will touch your fingers and hand and wrist to determine the areas that are most painful and to evaluate if any damage has occurred to the blood vessels or nerves or tendons in the hand. Generally, any hand injury -- except for the most minor one -- should be seen by a doctor. Simple first aid, however, can help prevent further injury. Control any bleeding by placing a clean cloth or gauze pad over the wound. As soon as the injury has occurred, apply ice to the injured area to decrease pain and reduce swelling. Remove any jewelry immediately. The hand may swell dramatically, and jewelry will be almost impossible to remove after the swelling has started. Contact your doctor, who will often refer you to an emergency department for diagnosis and treatment. If the hand is obviously deformed, try to support the injured hand by placing it on a pillow and carrying the pillow with you to the hospital or doctor's office. Take acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) as directed on the label for pain. Because of the complexity of the hand, treatment of hand injuries can become involved. The procedure is usually as follows: The doctor will usually obtain an X-ray. Your hand may be partially numbed by injecting the nerves at the wrist or at the base of a finger. Wounds will be carefully irrigated and explored. Any cuts usually will be closed carefully (whether with stitches or other means). You may be given antibiotics to keep the wound from becoming infected. The injured part will be immobilized in a splint to hold it in a particular position. You may be referred to a hand specialist (orthopedic or plastic surgeon). You may receive pain medicine to use for several days after the injury. Follow-up After you leave the hospital or doctor's office, you can make your healing process as successful as possible by following this advice. Read any instructions given to you by the hospital and ask questions about those that you do not understand. Several studies have shown that instructional material is often not read or incompletely understood. If you are placed in a splint, do not remove it until you are told to do so. Take the pain medicine as recommended. Often, a hand injury will throb all night, keeping you awake. Keep the hand elevated as much as possible. This will reduce pain and decrease swelling. Keep your follow-up appointments and take all medicines as directed. The vast majority of injuries can be prevented. To prevent hand injuries on the job: Look for hand hazards before an accident can happen. Don't use your hands to wipe away debris in a machine, use a brush that is designed for that purpose. Check your equipment and machinery before you start and after you finish. Be sure that it is in good operating condition. Before you repair or clean machinery, be sure that the power is disconnected and follow all safety procedures. Do not wear gloves, jewelry, or loose clothing when working near a machine with moving parts. Wear the correct protective equipment-gloves, guards, forearm cuffs-for the work you are doing. Be sure your gloves fit properly and are meant for the work you are doing. Use appropriate safety equipment while playing sports to prevent or limit the extent of fractures. Hand and wrist guards are appropriate when playing certain sports (rollerblading, lacrosse, hockey). Sports that involve a ball (football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball) are more likely to cause hand injuries. Take special care when playing these games. Practice household safety measures, especially with small children, to decrease the chances of all injuries, including those to the hands. Get timely medical evaluation and treatment to prevent the long-term disability of a hand injury. Avoid using your hands to punch, hit, or pound any objects in anger. Many injuries to the hands are self-inflicted in this manner. Because hand injuries and finger injuries can be handicapping, it is extremely important that they are evaluated thoroughly. The prognosis depends on whether the injury involved a joint, whether tissue was lost, whether infection occurred, and often how well you will follow instructions. Many seemingly minor fractures will require surgery followed by some physical therapy to regain the maximum amount of function. fractured hand, hand injury, broken hand"
185,"Is choking Has difficulty breathing For choking, see Choking Treatment. Have the person breathe through his or her mouth. For adult with an object partially out of the nose, try to remove it with fingers or tweezers. Do not push it further into the nose. For an object deeper in the nose, pinch the clear side of the nose closed. Have the person blow his or her nose hard several times. This may dislodge the object. Do not try to grab or pull an object that is stuck up a child's nose. You can try gently closing the unaffected nostril. Blow a puff of air into the child's mouth. Repeat as necessary. If minor bleeding occurs after object removal, firmly pinch the nose shut for 10 minutes. You can also put a cold pack on the nose or cheeks for bleeding. See a health care provider or go to a hospital emergency room if: You can't remove the object or can only remove part of it. The object poses immediate danger. You're not comfortable removing a sharp object, such as a nose ring or stud or broken glass. The person has a bloody nose that can't be stopped. Bad smelling fluid draining out of the nose. Call your health care provider if signs of infection appear. If the nose is tender or stuffy: Give extra fluids for 2 to 3 days. Have the person breathe moist air from a humidifier or hot shower. Have the person sleep with head elevated. Ask your health care provider about using an oral decongestant or decongestant nasal spray. If you seek medical help to remove the object: The health care provider will use suction or another method to remove it. The person may need numbing drops placed in the nose or to be sedated. The health care provider may prescribe nose drops or an antibiotic ointment."
186,"Your doctor can help you find a sleep apnea treatment that works best for you. But you can also do things at home to improve your symptoms. Some of them will even boost your health overall, and lower your chances for other medical problems. Not all people with sleep apnea are overweight or obese, but about half are. If you have some extra weight, then slimming down -- even by a few pounds -- can often improve your symptoms. In one study, 71 people with the disorder got either lifestyle counseling or joined a program that included a 12-week low-calorie diet. On average, those in the diet group shed 16 pounds. After 2 years, sleep apnea was much less severe for them than it was for the people who got counseling only. Another study looked at how dropping pounds affected sleep apnea among obese people with type 2 diabetes. The people joined either a weight loss group or a diabetes management group for 1 year. On average, those in the weight loss group lost nearly 24 pounds, while those in the other group lost 1.3 pounds. The effects of trimming down were even more dramatic in this study. More than three times as many people in the weight loss group wound up with no symptoms of sleep apnea at all. And among the people in that group who still had the disorder, it was much less severe after they slimmed down. You already know that lighting up and drinking too much booze aren't the healthiest moves you can make. Did you know they can also make your sleep apnea symptoms worse? Cigarette smoking increases swelling in your upper airway. That can aggravate symptoms like snoring and pauses in breathing. Alcohol decreases the muscle tone in the back of the throat, which can interfere with air flow -- the last thing you need when you already have breathing problems. Some research shows that sleep apnea may mean you're more likely to choose the unhealthy stuff at meals and snacks. When you don't get enough sleep, you might be more likely to crave carbs. Lack of Zzz's and fatigue have also been linked with changes in the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which control your feelings of hunger and fullness. When you're tired, you may want to eat more, and you might feel less satisfied when you do. You don't need to be overweight to have an unhealthy diet. In a study of 320 adults, those with more severe sleep apnea ate more protein, fat, and saturated fat than those who had a less-severe problem, regardless of how much they weighed. It's no surprise that sleeping and breathing are harder when you're stuffed up from nasal allergies. Picture your airway as a long, muscular tube running from your nose to your windpipe. If your allergies aren't under control, the tissues of your upper throat swell and make the airway narrow. With less space for air, breathing gets harder. If you have nasal allergies, talk to your doctor about how to get them under control. It may help to use a neti pot or a saline nasal spray before bed. Shut-eye is an important part of good health. The catch is that sleep apnea makes it hard to get enough. About half of people with the condition have most of their breathing problems when they sleep on their backs. So most doctors encourage people to try to stay in other positions. But how can you get into the habit? Some doctors suggest a simple trick: Put two tennis balls into a tube sock and pin it to the back of your PJs. Devices that improve breathing for people with the disorder, including a CPAP machine, can also help. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment plan for you."
187,"A hammertoe occurs from a muscle and ligament imbalance around the toe joint which causes the middle joint of the toe to buckle and become stuck in this position. The most common complaint with hammertoes is rubbing and irritation on the top of the bent toe. Toes that may curl rather than buckle -- most commonly the baby toe -- are also considered hammertoes. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The middle three toes are likeliest to be affected. Women are more likely to get pain associated with hammertoes than men because of shoe gear. Hammertoes can be a serious problem in people with diabetes or poor circulation because they have a higher risk for infections and foot ulcers. Custom orthopedic shoes may prevent these complications. People with these conditions should see a doctor at the first sign of foot trouble. There are two types of hammertoes: Flexible hammertoes. If the toe still can be moved at the joint, it's a flexible hammertoe. That's good, because this is an earlier, milder form of the problem. There may be several treatment options. Rigid hammertoes. If the tendons in the toe become rigid, they press the joint out of alignment. At this stage, the toe can't be moved. It usually means that surgery is needed. The muscles of each toe work in pairs. When the toe muscles get out of balance, a hammertoe can form. Muscle imbalance puts a lot of pressure on the toe's tendons and joints. This pressure forces the toe into a hammerhead shape. Risk factors for hammertoes include: Flat feet Genes: You may have inherited a tendency to develop hammertoes because your feet are somewhat unstable -- they may be flat or have a high arch. Arthritis Injury to the toe: Ill-fitting shoes are the main culprits. If shoes are too tight, too short, or too pointy, they push the toes out of balance. Pointy, high-heeled shoes put particularly severe pressure on the toes. Aging"
188,"If your child has crooked teeth or a misaligned jaw, talk to his dentist. She may recommend seeing an orthodontist. An orthodontist specializes in perfecting smiles using orthodontic appliances, such as: Bands Brackets Wires Headgear Rubber bands Retainers Clear aligners Web MD takes a look at common forms of orthodontics and gives you the facts you need to make an informed decision about orthodontic treatment. There are a number of dental appliances used today. But braces are still the primary means for straightening teeth and correcting misaligned bites in children. Braces work by applying pressure to the teeth and jaws to move them into a desired position. Braces are not the shiny mouthful of metal of years past. Many more options are now available. Teeth used to be fully banded. But today, brackets are bonded directly to each tooth's surface. Braces are made of materials such as: Stainless steel Ceramic Plastic Combination of materials This can give a clear or tooth-colored appearance to the braces. When appropriate, the wires can be made of materials such as nickel-titanium or copper-titanium. These materials may be longer lasting and require fewer adjustments than stainless steel wires. Clear, invisible ""trays"" are now available. These can straighten teeth without using traditional braces and wires. Invisible trays may be an option for some people who require orthodontic work. This method uses custom-made, clear, removable trays that put pressure on the teeth, moving them gradually into their correct position. Other appliances used in orthodontics include: TADs: Temporary anchorage devices ( TADs) are mini-screws ranging from 6 to 12 millimeters in length and 1.2 to 2 millimeters in diameter. When needed they may be temporarily fixed to bone in the mouth to provide a fixed point from which to apply force to move teeth. TADs allow for more predictable tooth control. They are becoming more common in orthodontic treatment. Rubber bands: Rubber bands are also called elastics. They are used when more force is needed to move the teeth and jaws into the desired position. You can choose your favorite color. Many kids choose their school colors or decorate their mouth during holidays (for example, orange and black for Halloween). Headgear: Some people can benefit from using headgear. The appliance is attached to the braces from the back of the head and can be removed. As with rubber bands, headgear are used when extra force is needed to move the teeth and jaws. If a headgear is needed, it usually only has to be worn at night while sleeping or at home. Retainers: Retainers are used to keep teeth in place once braces are removed. It takes time for your teeth to settle into their new position. By wearing a retainer, you can prevent your teeth from shifting. Some retainers may be removable. Others are fixed -- bonded behind your teeth. Some retainers are made of clear plastic and metal wires. Others are made of rubber. And like braces, retainers can make a statement if you choose. There are glow-in-the-dark retainers or retainers customized with a picture. Yes. Many dentists have training in orthodontics. However, if more extensive orthodontic work is needed, it may be best to see an orthodontist. An orthodontist has two to three years of advanced orthodontic education and training beyond dental school. He or she specializes in straightening teeth, correcting misaligned bites, and jaw problems. Your dentist can tell you when to seek evaluation from an orthodontist. The American Association of Orthodontists and the American Dental Association recommend all kids be evaluated for orthodontics by age 7. By this age, the orthodontist can detect subtle problems with jaw growth and emerging teeth. Most kids begin active treatment between ages 9 and 14. Orthodontists recommend you correct dental problems while your child is still growing. Once they stop growing, treatment may take longer and require more extensive work. There is no set age when children require orthodontics. The treatment plan will depend on individual needs. For example, kids with cleft palates get orthodontic appliances before their first teeth erupt. Other kids may benefit from starting treatment as early as age 6 or 7, even if they have not lost all of their baby teeth. The goal of early treatment is to prevent further problems from developing. It will create a better environment for the permanent teeth to erupt, or grow, into. Most kids who require early orthodontics will still need braces or additional work later to complete the tooth and jaw alignment process. But the amount of work may be significantly less if orthodontic treatment was completed early. "" Hurt"" may be too strong of a word. But your child may have some discomfort when braces are first put on, when they are adjusted, or when you start using a new appliance, such as rubber bands or a headgear. Any pain or discomfort can be relieved by taking acetaminophen ( Tylenol). Also, if the wire, brackets, or bands irritate your child's mouth, your orthodontist can provide special wax to cover the sharp areas on the braces. Yes. Some people are allergic to certain metals, such as nickel. When this happens, other materials can be used instead. People can also be allergic to the latex gloves used by the orthodontist and the assistants. If your child has a latex allergy, tell your dentist so that non-latex gloves can be used. Braces can sometimes irritate a child's gums, causing this to swell. This is not an allergic reaction, but something parents still need to watch for. Braces are delicate. Breaking part of the appliance can result in the teeth moving in the wrong direction and in longer treatment. Anything that is hard, sticky, or chewy should not be eaten, including: Ice Nuts Popcorn Hard candy Chewing gum Chewy candy, like caramel Gummies The length of treatment varies. It depends on the problem, how well your child cooperates, and your child's growth. Typically, most people wear braces from 18 to 36 months. Ideally, your child should wear a retainer forever, even if it is only one night a week. Of course, this may not be practical. The teeth are like the rest of the body and the body changes. Once your child stops wearing the retainer, slight changes to the teeth should be expected. The cost varies depending on the extent of work being done, the type of braces being used, and where you live. But you should expect to pay between $2,000 and $8,000. Most orthodontists provide different payment plans and will allow you to make payments over the course of treatment without charging interest. Some may take insurance. Ask your orthodontist about all treatment fees and payment plans they offer before treatment begins. If your child could benefit from braces but you can't afford it, there may be other ways to cover the cost, including: Financial aid programs: Low-income families can apply to the Smiles Change Lives program. This provides access to orthodontic treatment for children between the ages of 11 and 18 years of age. If accepted, the child can receive braces for $250 to $500. To be accepted, you must meet certain income requirements (for example, a family of four cannot earn more than $40,000 per year) and your teeth must be moderately to severely crooked. Medicaid: Medicaid may cover braces, especially if your child's teeth cause problems with talking, eating, or swallowing. This coverage varies from state to state. Dental schools: If you live close to a dental school with an orthodontics program, you may be able to get treatment from a student (supervised by an experienced orthodontist) for a lower cost. Dentists: Some general dentists provide orthodontic treatment and may be able to take care of your orthodontic needs at a reduced rate since they are not orthodontists. Making the decision to embark on orthodontic treatment may not be easy, but an improved smile can make a huge difference in appearance and self-esteem. There are many options available. When choosing a treatment plan, you need to consider many factors, including the orthodontic needs, cost, and primary goals of treatment. Your dentist or orthodontist can help you make the right decision for you and your child."
189,"Allergies aren't always to blame for eczema, but the two often go together. Studies show that 1 in 3 infants will have eczema. Here's what you need to know about these conditions in kids, plus advice on how to treat them. Symptoms include a dry, itchy, scaly, red rash. It may ooze and crust over, especially if your child scratches it. Eczema is common on the arms, elbows, legs, knees, hands, and face. The rash can be quite irritating. It can make it hard for kids to sleep. Soaps and cosmetics, cleaners, wool, dust mites, pollen, pet dander, and dry weather can cause flare-ups. Eczema won't spread from one part of the body to another, or from one person to another. Eczema in kids often fades. Most babies outgrow it by the time they're teens or even earlier. Kids with allergies -- especially to foods like milk and peanuts -- are more likely to have eczema. Having parents with allergies or asthma increases a child's risk of eczema. Kids with eczema are more likely to get allergies and asthma later in life. Keeping your kid away from allergy triggers can ease eczema symptoms. If your child has symptoms, see a doctor. There are lots of ways to control eczema and allergies. Tests. Your doctor may want to test your child for allergies to foods -- like milk, egg, peanut, soy, and wheat -- and other substances. Positive results from allergy testing need to be confirmed. Food elimination diets. If your doctor suggests it, you can cut out common trigger foods, one at a time. That will help you figure out if a food is to blame. Ointments and moisturizers. These products can ease mild eczema symptoms. Choose one that's thick, and put it on right after your child gets out of a bath or shower. Medication . Steroid creams can relieve more severe symptoms. Follow these steps to stop the problem before it starts. Allergy-proof your home, so your child won't be exposed to high levels of things like dust mites and dander. Keep her skin moist. Dry skin can trigger eczema. Keep fingernails short. That way, your child is less likely to irritate her skin by scratching. Put socks on your baby's hands to stop scratching when she's asleep. Keep your child cool in summer. Hot weather and sweat can make symptoms worse. Use non-scented soaps. Avoid harsh cleaners. Chemicals can irritate the skin. Dress your child in soft, loose-fitting, cotton clothing. Avoid wool and nylon. Protect your child from dry, cold weather. Dress her warmly when it's cold (but don't overheat). Use a humidifier in the winter when the air is dry."
190,"Unless it causes you pain, you might never give your shoulder's labrum a thought. This thick band of tissue surrounds your shoulder socket and keeps your shoulder joint stable. There are different kinds of labrum tears. A labrum SLAP tear happens in a specific area. Your shoulder has three bones: the scapula (shoulder blade), humerus (upper arm bone), and clavicle (collarbone). They work together in a ball-and-socket joint where the arm connects to your trunk. Your shoulder's labrum isn't a bone. It's soft tissue that helps connect the socket part of the scapula (called the glenoid) with the head of the humerus. If the labrum tears, there's not enough cushion between those bones. You also have a labrum in your hip sockets, which also acts like a connective cushion. There are many different kinds of shoulder labrum tears. A labrum SLAP tear covers a specific area. The upper, or superior, part of your labrum attaches to your biceps tendon. In a labrum SLAP tear, SLAP stands for superior labrum anterior and posterior. This means your labrum is torn at the top in both the front (anterior) and back (posterior) of where it attaches to the biceps tendon. There are three ways to tear your labrum: Overuse. Anyone who uses their shoulder to make the same motion over and over can tear their labrum. You might repeat an overhead motion at work or during activity. Think of a weightlifter who jerks a barbell up again and again. Injury. When you slip, it's normal to stretch out your arm to break the fall. The impact on the extended arm can cause a labrum SLAP tear. You can also tear your labrum in a car wreck, by dislocating your shoulder, or while doing something that pulls hard on your arm. Wear and tear. Car tires get worn down when you put a lot of miles on them, and so does your labrum. Day in and day out, your labrum does a lot of work. If you're 40 or older, it's a common issue. In most cases, a labrum SLAP tear doesn't hurt all the time. The pain usually happens when you use your shoulder to do a task, especially an overhead activity. You may also notice: A catching, locking, or grinding feeling An unstable feeling in the shoulder Loss of strength Low range of motion There are different ways to tear your labrum and different places where it can tear. A labrum SLAP tear is just one of those ways, and the symptoms are often similar, so it can be hard to diagnose. Before a physical exam, your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms, pain level, and where it hurts. If there's a specific injury or event that changed the way your shoulder feels, tell your doctor. During the physical exam, your doctor will move your arm and shoulder into different positions. If your doctor rules out inflammation or a pinched nerve, an X-ray or MRI is the next step. An X-ray can't see your labrum, but it can show fractures that might cause the pain. Your labrum will show up on an MRI. You might need to get a shot of dye in your shoulder for contrast. Surgery is usually not the first treatment option. Doctors often start by prescribing anti-inflammatory drugs for pain and swelling. Once that's under control, your doctor may recommend working with a physical therapist or show you specific exercises to build your muscles back up. If medication and exercise don't help enough, surgery may be your next step. The kind of operation depends on your injury, age, and how active you are. Surgeons often repair labrum SLAP tears with arthroscopy, in which the doctor makes and works through small cuts in your shoulder. They place a tiny camera in your shoulder joint. This sends images to a bigger screen in the operating room. Using small tools, your surgeon can trim the torn part of your labrum, and then repair or reattach it. Expect to be in a sling for a month or so to keep your arm still. After the swelling has gone down, you can move it again with guidance from a physical therapist. Depending on your age and the extent of your tear, it could take 2 months for your labrum to heal and another 2 months to build up the same strength you felt before the tear."
191,"Multiple sclerosis ( MS) flare-ups have common triggers. Preparation for them can help lower your chance of getting one. With relapsing-remitting MS, flare-ups can bring new symptoms or make ones you already have worse. They come on suddenly over 24 hours and get better slowly over weeks or months. They may never totally go away. These happen because part of your central nervous system gets inflamed. The inflammation slows or disrupts nerve signals. That brings things like numbness, pain, and dizziness. What triggers a flare-up is different from person to person. Most of the time, a cause cannot be found. Still, to lower your chance of a flare-up, do your best to avoid the things that make them more likely for you. For example: It's a part of life, but doing what you can to manage it can lower your chance of a relapse. Meditation, yoga, and counseling are all ways to lower stress and better equip yourself to handle it. In one study, MS patients reported their stress level cut nearly in half after 6 weeks of yoga. Lack of sleep can bring a flare-up. Making sleep a priority will help lower your chance of symptoms. Try to get 7-8 hours each night. High temperatures may trigger a relapse. If you're one of those people affected by warm surroundings, you should skip saunas, hot tubs, and hot showers and baths. Most of the time hot weather causes fatigue. Also, do what you can to avoid being outdoors on hot days. A cool bath and air conditioning are two things that can help. Special hats or clothes that hold ice packs or frozen gel packs can also keep you comfortable. There are also special vests that use a motorized system to circulate cold water around the body. If you have an exercise goal, divide the time you exercise into smaller segments, with rest after each one. They cause a third of MS flare-ups. To lower your risk: Wash your hands. Do what you can to avoid people who are ill. Make sure food you eat is fully cooked. Practice safe sex. Get your annual flu shot. Even minor infections like the cold or flu can trigger a flare-up. If you have an infection, treat it early. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. They're believed to fight inflammation. Also, get plenty of fiber and stay away from foods with saturated and trans fats. A healthy diet helps keep your immune system strong. Skipping your MS medicine can increase your risk for a flare-up. One study found about 25% of MS patients who stopped taking their medications suffered a relapse. Certain medications for Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis may cause MS-like symptoms. So can drug interactions. Check with your doctor to see if there are medications you're taking that could be interacting with one another. Smoking is a major risk factor for flare-ups. Stop and you'll lower your chances of them. Your doctor can help you figure out a game plan."
192,"If you have tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC), your cells don't stop dividing when they should. This means you get tumors in lots of places in your body. They aren't cancer, but they can cause problems where they're growing. There are treatments available that can shrink the tumors and make you more comfortable. Every case is different. You might get TSC in certain parts of your body, and TSC might affect someone else differently. The tumors can look like thick or light patches on your skin, and if they're in your lungs, they can cause breathing problems. Treatments can help you manage your symptoms and live an independent life. Between 1 million and 2 million people around the world have this condition. You get TSC because of a problem in your genes. For most people, it's caused by changes that happened when your cells were first coming together or when you were just an embryo. About a third of people inherit TSC from a parent. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of getting it. Symptoms usually show up early, shortly after birth. But they can also appear later in life. Your symptoms depend on how many tumors you have, how big they are, and where they are. When you have TSC, all of that can change throughout your life. Tumors in a kidney can stop it from working like it should. They can also cause bleeding inside your body or high blood pressure. Tumors in your heart usually happen when you're young, and they shrink over time. But they can block blood flow or cause problems with your heart rhythm. Lung tumors can make you short of breath, even after mild exercise. They can also cause a cough or make your lung collapse. Tumors in your brain could cause: Seizures, which can be mild at first Behavior changes, such as temper tantrums, anxiety, or sleep problems Nausea or headaches Problems such as autism and developmental delays Tumors in your eyes can make you see double or give you blurry vision. In other places in your body, you may have patches of different color skin and dark or light growths that might look like warts. In your mouth, tuberous sclerosis can weaken the enamel on your teeth or make your gums overgrow. With so many different symptoms, diagnosing this condition can be tricky. Your doctor will talk with you before doing any testing, asking questions such as: What did you notice that brought you here today? When did it start? Have you had seizures? If so, what happens? How long do they last? How often? How often do you have headaches? How bad are they? Does anyone else in your family have seizures or epilepsy? Does anyone in your family have TSC? Your doctor may check your eyes and skin, as well as ask you to get imaging tests. These can include: A CT scan. This series of X-rays creates detailed pictures of your body to check for tumors and other changes related to the disease. An MRI. This makes a more detailed image than CT. An MRI scan can show how blood and spinal fluid are flowing, and can help pinpoint locations of tumors and other changes. The doctor may inject a dye to make certain kinds of tissue look different in the image. That helps them see changes faster and clearer. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound test of the heart. It shows tumors and other changes in the heart. Gene tests, done from a blood sample, can also confirm that you have TSC. How fast might the tumors grow? How do the tumors cause the symptoms? How might my symptoms change over time? What treatments are available? What are the possible complications from those treatments? When do I need to go to the emergency room? Should the rest of my family be tested? If I have another baby (or if my child has a child), what are the chances that the baby will have TSC? Is there a local support network for families affected by this condition? Your treatment will depend on your particular case. Doctors target the places where the tumors are growing. If TSC is affecting your kidneys, doctors may be able to block or reduce blood flow to kidney tumors, or give you drugs to help shrink them. You may need surgery to remove the tumors. At some point, you may also need dialysis or a kidney transplant. If you have tumors in your brain, sometimes drugs can shrink them, or surgeons can remove them. The drug Afinitor (everolimus) is approved by the FDA to treat specific types of brain and kidney tumors caused by TSC, too. When a child with seizures gets treated, it helps their brain develop, and he can learn better. Some people with lung problems from TSC take the drug sirolimus, which works on your immune system. Laser treatment (dermabrasion) can help ""refinish,"" or smooth your skin before tumors become large. Having a disease like TSC can be tough, so find ways to reduce your stress and keep doing the things you love. If your child has TSC, remember he's still a little one. Let him be a child. Pay close attention to changes in your body, and tell your doctor about them. Keep up with your treatment, and make regular visits to your doctor, letting them know about anything that concerns you. Talk with your family and friends about the condition. They'll want to know how they can support you. Ask them for things you need, as they may not know what's most helpful for you. Joining a support group can help you manage better. Hearing from other people and families who face similar challenges can help you understand what's going on and make you feel connected. They can also offer tips for dealing with symptoms. If you feel overwhelmed or depressed, ask your doctor if he can recommend a therapist or counselor who can help you. Although there isn't a cure for TSC, your doctors can help you avoid problems. With the right treatments, most people with TSC can expect a normal life span. Many have active, productive, independent lives. The National Organization for Rare Diseases or the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance can help you find a TSC clinic and an online or local support group."
193,"The kids won't stop screaming, your boss has been hounding you because you turned a report in late, and you owe the IRS thousands of dollars you don't have.

At times, it serves a useful purpose. Stress can motivate you to get that promotion at work, or run the last mile of a marathon. But if you don't get a handle on your stress and it becomes long-term, it can seriously interfere with your job, family life, and health. More than half of Americans say they fight with friends and loved ones because of stress, and more than 70% say they experience real physical and emotional symptoms from it. Read on to learn why you get stressed out, and how that stress might be affecting your health. Everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Forty percent of U. S. workers admit to experiencing office stress, and one-quarter say work is the biggest source of stress in their lives. Causes of work stress include: Being unhappy in your job Having a heavy workload or too much responsibility Working long hours Having poor management, unclear expectations of your work, or no say in the decision-making process Working under dangerous conditions Being insecure about your chance for advancement or risk of termination Having to give speeches in front of colleagues Facing discrimination or harassment at work, especially if your company isn't supportive Life stresses can also have a big impact. Examples of life stresses are: The death of a loved one Divorce Loss of a job Increase in financial obligations Getting married Moving to a new home Chronic illness or injury Emotional problems (depression, anxiety, anger, grief, guilt, low self-esteem) Taking care of an elderly or sick family member Traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, theft, rape, or violence against you or a loved one Sometimes the stress comes from inside, rather than outside. You can stress yourself out just by worrying about things. All of these factors can lead to stress: Fear and uncertainty. When you regularly hear about the threat of terrorist attacks, global warming, and toxic chemicals on the news, it can cause you to feel stressed, especially because you feel like you have no control over those events. And even though disasters are typically very rare events, their vivid coverage in the media may make them seem as if they are more likely to occur than they really are. Fears can also hit closer to home, such as being worried that you won't finish a project at work or won't have enough money to pay your bills this month. Attitudes and perceptions. How you view the world or a particular situation can determine whether it causes stress. For example, if your television set is stolen and you take the attitude, "" It's OK, my insurance company will pay for a new one,"" you'll be far less stressed than if you think, "" My TV is gone and I'll never get it back! What if the thieves come back to my house to steal again?"" Similarly, people who feel like they're doing a good job at work will be less stressed out by a big upcoming project than those who worry that they are incompetent. Unrealistic expectations. No one is perfect. If you expect to do everything right all the time, you're destined to feel stressed when things don't go as expected. Change. Any major life change can be stressful -- even a happy event like a wedding or a job promotion. More unpleasant events, such as a divorce, major financial setback, or death in the family can be significant sources of stress. Your stress level will differ based on your personality and how you respond to situations. Some people let everything roll off their back. To them, work stresses and life stresses are just minor bumps in the road. Others literally worry themselves sick. When you are in a stressful situation, your body launches a physical response. Your nervous system springs into action, releasing hormones that prepare you to either fight or take off. It's called the ""fight or flight"" response, and it's why, when you're in a stressful situation, you may notice that your heartbeat speeds up, your breathing gets faster, your muscles tense, and you start to sweat. This kind of stress is short-term and temporary (acute stress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it. But if your stress system stays activated over a long period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to or aggravate more serious health problems. The constant rush of stress hormones can put a lot of wear and tear on your body, causing it to age more quickly and making it more prone to illness. If you've been stressed out for a short period of time, you may start to notice some of these physical signs: Headache Fatigue Difficulty sleeping Difficulty concentrating Upset stomach Irritability When stress becomes long-term and is not properly addressed, it can lead to a number of more serious health conditions, including: Depression High blood pressure Abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Heart disease Heart attack Heartburn, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome Upset stomach -- cramps, constipation, and diarrhea Weight gain or loss Changes in sex drive Fertility problems Flare-ups of asthma or arthritis Skin problems such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis Managing your stress can make a real difference to your health. One study showed that women with heart disease lived longer if they underwent a stress management program."

195,"When you meet someone who has Asperger's syndrome, you might notice two things right off. He's just as smart as other folks, but he has more trouble with social skills. He also tends to have an obsessive focus on one topic or perform the same behaviors again and again. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Doctors used to think of Asperger's as a separate condition. But in 2013, the newest edition of the standard book that mental health experts use, called The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5), changed how it's classified. Today, Asperger's syndrome is technically no longer a diagnosis on its own. It is now part of a broader category called autism spectrum disorder ( ASD). This group of related mental health issues shares some symptoms. Even so, lots of people still use the term Asperger's. The condition is what doctors call a ""high-functioning"" type of ASD. This means the symptoms are less severe than other kinds of autism spectrum disorders. The DSM-5 also includes a new diagnosis, called social pragmatic communication disorder, which has some symptoms that overlap with Asperger's. Doctors use it to describe people who have trouble talking and writing, but have normal intelligence. They start early in life. If you're a mom or dad of a kid who has it, you may notice that he can't make eye contact. You may also find that your child seems awkward in social situations and doesn't know what to say or how to respond when someone talks to him. He may miss social cues that are obvious to other folks, like body language or the expressions on people's faces. For instance, he may not realize that when somebody crosses his arms and scowls, he's angry. Another sign is that your child may show few emotions. He may not smile when he's happy or laugh at a joke. Or he may speak in a flat, robotic kind of way. If your child has the condition, he may talk about himself most of the time and zero in with a lot of intensity on a single subject, like rocks or football stats. And he might repeat himself a lot, especially on a topic that he's interested in. He might also do the same movements over and over. He also may dislike change. For instance, he may eat the same food for breakfast every day or have trouble moving from one class to another during the school day. If you notice signs in your child, see your pediatrician. He can refer you to a mental health expert who specializes in ASDs, like one of these: Psychologist. He diagnoses and treats problems with emotions and behavior. Pediatric neurologist. He treats conditions of the brain. Developmental pediatrician. He specializes in speech and language issues and other developmental problems. Psychiatrist. He has expertise in mental health conditions and can prescribe medicine to treat them. The condition is often treated with a team approach. That means you might see more than one doctor for your child's care. The doctor will ask questions about your child's behavior, including: What symptoms does he have, and when did you first notice them? When did your child first learn to speak, and how does he communicate? Is he focused on any subjects or activities? Does he have friends, and how does he interact with others? Then he'll observe your child in different situations to see firsthand how he communicates and behaves. Every child is different, so there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. Your doctor might need to try a few therapies to find one that works. Treatments can include: Social skills training. In groups or one-on-one sessions, therapists teach your child how to interact with others and express themselves in more appropriate ways. Social skills are often best learned by modeling after typical behavior. Speech-language therapy. This helps improve your kid's communication skills. For example, he'll learn how to use a normal up-and-down pattern when he speaks rather than a flat tone. He'll also get lessons on how to keep up a two-way conversation and understand social cues like hand gestures and eye contact. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT). It helps your child change his way of thinking, so he can better control his emotions and repetitive behaviors. He'll be able to get a handle on things like outbursts, meltdowns, and obsessions. Parent education and training. You'll learn many of the same techniques your child is taught so you can work on social skills with him at home. Some families also see a counselor to help them deal with the challenges of living with someone with Asperger's. Applied behavior analysis. It's a technique that encourages positive social and communication skills in your child -- and discourages behavior you'd rather not see. The therapist will use praise or other ""positive reinforcement"" to get results. Medicine. There aren't any drugs approved by the FDA that specifically treat Asperger's or autism spectrum disorders. Some medications, though, can help with related symptoms like depression and anxiety. Your doctor may prescribe some of these: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) Antipsychotic drugs Stimulant medicines With the right treatment, your child can learn to control some of the social and communication challenges he faces. He can do well in school and go on to succeed in life."
196,"If you had chickenpox as a child, you might recall the itchy, spotted rash that popped up on your face and body. The varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox stays inside your body for many years. Once you're older, that same virus can wake up and cause shingles, also called herpes zoster. It gives you a rash, too, but it's often more painful than itchy. A blistering rash on one side of your body can be a sign you have it. See your doctor to find out for sure. Once you've been diagnosed, you can get treated to help relieve your rash and other symptoms. Your doctor will first ask whether you've had chickenpox and look at your symptoms. A rash is the main sign of shingles. Often your doctor can tell that you have it from your skin alone. A shingles rash: Appears on one side of your body and/or face Stings, burns, and/or itches Starts as red bumps that form into blisters Other conditions also cause rashes that look like shingles. Your doctor might check to see if you have: Contact dermatitis: A skin reaction caused by an allergy to latex, metals, chemicals, or drugs Candida infection: It comes from a type of yeast called Candida Dermatitis herpetiformis: A rash that some people with celiac disease can get Impetigo: A skin infection caused by bacteria Insect bites: Sometimes, they can look like shingles Folliculitis: The tiny holes that hairs grow out of can get inflamed Scabies: A skin condition caused by a small bug called a mite One way to tell shingles from these conditions is by the other symptoms that come with it. You can also have: Fever Headache Chills Nausea Doctors rarely test for shingles unless the rash alone isn't enough to make a diagnosis. Some people get tested because they're at higher risk for complications. You might have a test done if you: Are about to have an organ transplant Have a weakened immune system Are going to begin a drug that lowers your immune system Doctors use two types of tests to diagnose chickenpox or shingles: Antibody: When you're exposed to varicella zoster, your immune system makes proteins to fight it. Your doctor can look for these proteins, called antibodies, in a sample of your blood. He takes the sample from a vein in your arm. These tests might be able to tell whether you have chickenpox now or have had it in the past, but the results are often hard to interpret. Viral detection: This test can find out if varicella zoster virus is present in the rash. Your doctor can collect samples from scabs from blisters that have crusted over. Your doctor should have the results in 1 to 3 days. You might need to have a second test if the results aren't clear. Your symptoms and test results will show whether you have shingles. Once you've been diagnosed, you can start on treatment to help you feel better."
197,"The normal, healthy heart has its own pacemaker that regulates the rate at which the heart beats. However, some hearts don't beat regularly. Often, a pacemaker device can correct the problem. A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm. A pacemaker may also be used to treat fainting spells (syncope), congestive heart failure, and, rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is implanted just under the skin of the chest during minor surgery. The pacemaker has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The pulse generator houses the battery and a tiny computer, and resides just under the skin of the chest. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. They send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle, as well as sense the heart's electrical activity. Each impulse causes the heart to contract. The pacemaker may have one to three leads, depending on the type of pacemaker needed to treat your heart problem. There are different types of pacemakers: Single chamber pacemakers use one lead in the upper chambers (atria) or lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. Dual chamber pacemakers use one lead in the atria and one lead in the ventricles of your heart. Biventricular pacemaker uses three leads: one placed in the right atrium, one placed in the right ventricle, and one placed near the left ventricle. Your doctor will decide what type of pacemaker you need based on your heart condition. The doctor programs the minimum heart rate. When your heart rate drops below that set rate, your pacemaker generates (fires) an electrical impulse that passes through the lead to the heart muscle. This causes the heart muscle to contract, creating a heartbeat. Pacemakers are usually used to treat the following: Bradyarrhythmias. These are slow heart rhythms that may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system (such as the SA node, AV node or HIS- Purkinje system). Heart failure. This device is called cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) or biventricular pacing. Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take before getting a pacemaker implanted. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain drugs one to five days before the procedure. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetes medications. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the procedure. If you must take medications, take them only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. Pacemakers are implanted two ways: Endocardial approach. This is the most common technique used. This procedure is performed in a pacemaker or electrophysiology lab. A local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication) is given to numb the area. An incision is made in the chest where the leads and pacemaker are inserted. The lead(s) is inserted through the incision and into a vein, then guided to the heart with the aid of the fluoroscopy machine. The lead tip attaches to the heart muscle, while the other end of the lead (attached to the pulse generator) is placed in a pocket created under the skin in the upper chest. Epicardial approach. This technique is more commonly used in children. This procedure is performed by a surgeon in a surgical suite. General anesthesia is given to put you to sleep. The surgeon attaches the lead tip to the heart muscle, while the other end of the lead (attached to the pulse generator) is placed in a pocket created under the skin in the abdomen. Although recovery with the epicardial approach is longer than that of the other approach, minimally invasive techniques have enabled shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times. The doctor will determine which pacemaker implant method is best for you. The endocardial pacemaker takes about 1-2 hours to implant. Here is an overview of the procedure: You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous line ( IV) into your arm or hand. This is so you may receive medications and fluids during the procedure. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The monitors allow the doctor and nurse to check your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and other measurements during the pacemaker implant. The left or right side of your chest will be shaved and cleansed with a special soap. Sterile drapes are used to cover you from your neck to your feet. A strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. The doctor will numb your skin by injecting a local numbing medication. You will feel a pinching or burning feeling at first. Then, it will become numb. Once this occurs, an incision will be made to insert the pacemaker and leads. You may feel a pulling as the doctor makes a pocket in the tissue under your skin for the pacemaker. You should not feel pain. If you do, tell your nurse. After the pocket is made, the doctor will insert the leads into a vein and guide them into position using the fluoroscopy machine. After the leads are in place, their function is tested to make sure they can increase your heart rate. This is called ""pacing"" and involves delivering small amounts of energy through the leads into the heart muscle. This causes the heart to contract. When your heart rate increases, you may feel your heart is racing or beating faster. It is very important to tell your doctor or nurse any symptoms you feel. Any pain should be reported immediately. After the leads are tested the doctor will connect them to your pacemaker. Your doctor will determine the rate of your pacemaker and other settings. The final pacemaker settings are done after the implant using a special device called a ""programmer."" You will be admitted to the hospital overnight for the pacemaker implantation. The nurses will monitor your heart rate and rhythm. The morning after your implant, you will have a chest X-ray to ensure the leads and pacemaker are in the proper position. You will be shown how to care for your wound. Keep your wound clean and dry. After five days, you may take a shower. Look at your wound every day to make sure it is healing. Call your doctor if you notice: Increased drainage, bleeding, or oozing from the insertion site Increased opening of the incision Redness around the site Warmth along the site Increased body temperature (fever or chills) Your pacemaker settings will be checked before you leave the hospital. You will receive a temporary ID card that tells you: The type of pacemaker and leads you have The date of the pacemaker implant The name of the doctor who implanted the pacemaker Within three months, you will receive a permanent card from the pacemaker company. CARRY THIS CARD WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES in case you need medical attention at another hospital. You may move your arm normally after getting your pacemaker. Do not lift objects that weigh more than 10 pounds. Do not hold your arms above shoulder level for three weeks. Avoid activities that require pushing or pulling heavy objects, such as shoveling the snow or mowing the lawn. Stop any activity before you become overtired. For six weeks after the procedure, avoid golfing, tennis, and swimming. Try to walk as much as possible for exercise. Ask your doctor when you can resume more strenuous activities. Your doctor will tell you when you can go back to work, usually within a week after you go home. If you have the flexibility at your job, ease back to your regular work schedule. Electric blankets, heating pads, and microwave ovens can be used and will not interfere with the function of your pacemaker. A cell phone should be used on the side opposite of where the pacemaker was implanted. Cell phones should not be placed directly against the chest or on the same side as your pacemaker. You will need to avoid strong electric or magnetic fields, such as: some industrial equipment; ham radios; high intensity radio waves (found near large electrical generators, power plants, or radio frequency transmission towers); and arc resistance welders. Do not undergo any tests that require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Your doctor or nurse can provide more information about what types of equipment may interfere with your pacemaker. If you have concerns about your job or activities, ask your doctor. A pacemaker usually lasts seven to ten years, depending on how often it is used. When the battery becomes low, your pacemaker will need to be changed. A complete pacemaker check should be done six weeks after your pacemaker is implanted. Adjustments will be made that will prolong the life of your pacemaker. Then your pacemaker should be checked every three months on the telephone to evaluate battery function. Your nurse will explain how to check your pacemaker using the telephone transmitter. Once or twice a year you will need a more complete exam at a hospital or doctor's office. If you have a biventricular pacemaker, you may need to visit the doctor's office or hospital every six months to make sure your device is working properly and the settings do not need to be adjusted."
198,"If you are concerned about the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, you may have heard about treatment with strontium. Some people say this supplement improves bone health, but it's important to think about its benefits and risks before you decide to take it. Strontium is a mineral found in seawater and soil. In your diet, you get it mainly from seafood, but you can also get small amounts of it in whole milk, wheat bran, meat, poultry, and root vegetables. Strontium is similar to calcium. It seems to play a role in how your body makes new bone while it slows the breakdown of old bone. That means it may affect how strong your bones are. Some research says that women with osteoporosis may not absorb strontium as they should. You can buy different forms of it, such as strontium citrate, in supplements at supermarkets and health food stores. Scientists haven't tested these supplements much, so there's not enough research to know if they fight osteoporosis. Also, the FDA doesn't regulate supplements in the same way as prescription drugs, so it's not possible to know if if they are safe or work well or even how much of the main ingredient they contain. If you want to take a strontium supplement, ask your doctor first. In Australia and some countries in Europe, a form of strontium called strontium ranelate ( Osseor, Protelos) is available as a prescription medication to treat and prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures. But the FDA hasn't approved it for sale in the U. S., and it's different from the forms of strontium that come in supplements that are available in the U. S.. The drug makes your bones stronger and lowers your chances of getting fractures. Doctors aren't sure exactly how it works, but it seems to help the body make more bone and keep the bone you have from breaking down. Strontium ranelate has risks though. Doctors can prescribe it only for postmenopausal women and for men with severe osteoporosis who can't take other drugs. It's also not for people who: Have blood clots or have had them before Can't move very much, either for a short time, such as after surgery, or for the long term, such as because of a disability Have a history of heart problems, like a heart attack, angina, or peripheral artery disease, which means there's less blood flow to your arms and legs Have high blood pressure that isn't under control"

An abscess is a collection of pus that forms near an area of infected skin or other soft tissue. The abscess can cause pain, swelling, and, if severe, blockage of the throat. If the throat is blocked, swallowing, speaking, and even breathing become difficult. When an infection of the tonsils (known as tonsillitis) spreads and causes infection in the soft tissues, a peritonsillar abscess may result. Peritonsillar abscesses are generally uncommon. When they do occur they are more likely among young adults, adolescents, and older children.. A peritonsillar abscess is most often a complication of tonsillitis. The bacteria involved are similar to those that cause strep throat. Streptococcal bacteria most commonly cause an infection in the soft tissue around the tonsils (usually just on one side). The tissue is then invaded by anaerobes (bacteria that can live without oxygen), which enter through nearby glands. Dental infection (such as the gum infections periodontitis and gingivitis) may be a risk factor. Other risk factors include: Chronic tonsillitis Infectious mononucleosis Smoking Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) Stones or calcium deposits in the tonsils (tonsilloliths) The first symptom of a peritonsillar abscess is usually a sore throat. A period without fever or other symptoms may follow as the abscess develops. It is not unusual for a delay of 2 to 5 days between the start of symptoms and abscess formation. The mouth and throat may show a swollen area of inflammation -- typically on one side. The uvula (the small finger of tissue that hangs down in the middle of the throat) may be shoved away from the swollen side of the mouth. Lymph glands in the neck may be enlarged and tender. Other signs and symptoms may be observed: Painful swallowing Fever and chills Spasm in the muscles of the jaw (trismus) and neck (torticollis) Ear pain on the same side as the abscess A muffled voice, often described as a ""hot potato"" voice (sounds as if you have a mouthful of hot potato when you talk) Difficulty swallowing saliva Discuss any sore throat with fever or other symptoms with your doctor by phone or with an office visit to see if you have a peritonsillar abscess. If you have a sore throat and trouble swallowing, trouble breathing, difficulty speaking, drooling, or any other signs of potential airway obstruction, you should go to the nearest emergency room. A peritonsillar abscess is usually diagnosed based on history and a physical exam. A peritonsillar abscess is easy to diagnose when it is large enough to see. The doctor will look into your mouth using a light and, possibly, a tongue depressor. Swelling and redness on one side of the throat near the tonsil suggests an abscess. The doctor may also gently push on the area with a gloved finger to see if there is pus from infection inside. Lab tests and X-rays are not used often. Sometimes an X-ray, CT scan, or an ultrasound will be performed, typically to make sure other upper airway illnesses are not present. These conditions may include the following: Epiglottitis, an inflammation of the epiglottis (the flap of tissue that prevents food from entering the windpipe) Retropharyngeal abscess, a pocket of pus that forms behind the soft tissue in the back of the throat (like a peritonsillar abscess but in a different location) Peritonsillar cellulitis, an infection of the soft tissue itself (a peritonsillar abscess forms beneath the surface of the tissue) Your doctor may test you for mononucleosis, a virus. Some experts suggest that mono is associated with up to 20% of peritonsillar abscesses. Your doctor also may send pus from the abscess to the lab so the exact bacteria can be identified. Even so, identifying the bacteria rarely changes treatment. There is no home treatment for peritonsillar abscess. Call your doctor for an immediate appointment to check your symptoms. If you have a peritonsillar abscess, the doctor's primary concern will be your breathing and airway. If your life is in danger because your throat is blocked, the first step may be to insert a needle in the pus pocket and drain away enough fluid so you can breathe comfortably. If your life is not in immediate danger, the doctor will make every effort to keep the procedure as painless as possible. You will receive a local anesthetic (like at the dentist) injected into the skin over the abscess and, if necessary, pain medicine and sedation through an IV inserted in your arm. The doctor will use suction to help you avoid swallowing pus and blood. The doctor has several options for treating you: Needle aspiration involves slowly putting a needle into the abscess and withdrawing the pus into a syringe. Incision and drainage involves using a scalpel to make a small cut in the abscess so pus can drain. Acute tonsillectomy (having a surgeon remove your tonsils) may be needed if, for some reason, you cannot tolerate a drainage procedure, or if you have a history of frequent tonsillitis. You will receive an antibiotic. The first dose may be given through an IV. Penicillin is the best drug for this type of infection, but if you are allergic, tell the doctor so another antibiotic can be used (other choices may be erythromycin or clindamycin). If you are healthy and the abscess drains well, you can go home. If you are very ill, cannot swallow, or have complicating medical problems (such as diabetes), you may be admitted to the hospital. Young children, who often need general anesthesia for drainage, frequently require a hospital stay for observation. Arrange follow-up with your doctor or an ear-nose-throat specialist (otolaryngologist) after treatment for a peritonsillar abscess. Also: If the abscess starts to return, you may need a different antibiotic or further drainage. If you develop excessive bleeding or have trouble breathing or swallowing, seek medical attention immediately. There is no reliable method for preventing a peritonsillar abscess other than limiting risks: Do not smoke, maintain good dental hygiene, and promptly treat oral infections. If you develop a peritonsillar abscess, you may possibly prevent peritonsillar cellulitis by taking an antibiotic. However, you should be closely monitored for abscess formation and may even be hospitalized. If you are likely to form an abscess (for example, if you have tonsillitis frequently), talk with your doctor about whether you should have your tonsils removed. As with any prescription, you must finish the full course of the antibiotic even if you feel better after a few days. People with an uncomplicated, well-treated peritonsillar abscess usually recover fully. If you don't have chronic tonsillitis (in which your tonsils regularly become inflamed), the chance of the abscess returning is only 10%, and removing your tonsils is usually not necessary. Most complications occur in people with diabetes, in people whose immune systems are weakened (such as those with AIDS, transplant recipients on immune-suppressing drugs, or cancer patients), or in those who don't recognize the seriousness of the illness and do not seek medical attention. Major complications of a peritonsillar abscess include: Airway blockage Bleeding from erosion of the abscess into a major blood vessel Dehydration from difficulty swallowing Infection in the tissues beneath the breastbone Pneumonia Meningitis Sepsis (bacteria in the bloodstream)"
200,"Headaches aren't just for adults. About 1 in 5 school-age children and teens are prone to having them, too. The most common type of headache in kids are tension headaches. But about 5% of children struggle with migraine headaches -- some as early as 4 years old. You might worry that your child's headache is a sign of a more serious problem, like a brain tumor. But that's untrue for most childhood headaches. Put your worries to rest by tracking your child's symptoms and talking to her doctor. Together you can find treatments and help your child learn ways to feel better. Most kids get them because of an illness, infection (like a cold), or a fever. For example, sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses) and infections of the throat or ear can trigger headaches. Migraine headaches are a different story. Doctors don't know exactly what causes them, but they do know they're linked to physical and chemical changes in the brain, as well as genes that parents pass to their kids. About 7 out of 10 kids who have migraine have a mom, dad, or sibling with a history of them. Similar things -- like fatigue, bright lights, and changes in weather -- might even trigger their attacks. Other migraine triggers include stress, anxiety, depression, a change in sleep patterns, loud noises, or certain foods. Too much physical activity or too much sun can bring on a migraine in some kids, too. Girls can get them because of hormone changes when they get their periods. This type of headache is called a menstrual migraine. Common causes of tension headaches include emotional stress, eye strain due to poor vision, and neck or back strain linked to poor posture. Most headaches are harmless. But if they get worse over time and happen with certain other symptoms, they can be a sign of a more serious problem. Take your child to a doctor right away if any of these symptoms occur with a headache: Loss of vision Vomiting Muscle weakness Any symptoms that cause your child to awaken during the night In young children headaches located in the back of the head Your child's doctor will examine her and ask questions about the headaches, including the type of pain, how often they happen, and if anything makes them better or worse. You and your child will need to be as specific as possible. Usually, the doctor can make a diagnosis based on this information. Sometimes, a CT or MRI is needed to give the doctor more information. These imaging tests create detailed pictures of the brain that can show any problem areas that could cause headaches. Once your doctor determines the specific type of headache your child is having, you can work together to create a treatment plan to help her feel better. If your child's headaches aren't happening with any other symptoms, you may wish to try some home remedies or over-the-counter pain relievers first to ease the pain. For tension headaches, these tips might help: Have your child lie down with her head raised slightly Take a hot bath or shower Place a cold or warm compress on her forehead or neck For a migraine: Lie down in a quiet, dark room and relax. Close the curtains and keep the noise down. Use a cold or warm compress. A single dose of over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen may ease the pain of both tension and migraine headaches. Experts recommend giving these painkillers to your child as soon as a migraine starts. Don't give it to her more than 2 days in a week; it could lead to rebound headaches. You might prefer to try natural headache remedies. Studies suggest that certain vitamins or herbs may help reduce the pain or frequency of headaches. They include: Vitamin B2. Also called riboflavin, this supplement may ease pain and prevent some headaches. Side effects are rare but include diarrhea, having to pee more than usual, and brighter yellow urine. Magnesium. Teens who have migraine headaches have lower levels of magnesium than other kids do. Taking this nutrient for several months may prevent some of these headaches. Magnesium supplements can cause diarrhea and interfere with some medications, so you should check with your child's doctor before using it. You can help boost your child's magnesium levels by adding more dark green, leafy vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, and whole grains to her diet. Coenzyme Q10 ( Co Q10). About one-third of kids with migraine are lacking in this antioxidant, which is normally found in every cell in the body. There are no significant side effects in kids. Mild gastrointestinal upset may occur, but it's rare. Always ask a pediatrician if a specific supplement is safe for your child before using it. Your doctor may recommend different headache treatments. The best one for your child will depend on the type of headache she has, how often it happens, what causes it, and her age. Some of the options your doctor might suggest might include: Tracking symptoms: Create a headache diary to note the things that trigger your child's headache, like a lack of sleep, not eating at regular times, certain foods or ingredients, caffeine, the environment, or stress. Once you learn what your child's headache triggers are, you can help her avoid them. Stress management : For both migraine and tension-type headaches, it's important for you and your child to figure out what causes them. Then you can help her find ways to deal with the things that are stressing her out. Biofeedback: Special sensors attached to the body track how your child responds to headaches. The sensors record changes in breathing, pulse, heart rate, temperature, muscle tension, and brain activity. This helps your child understand how her body physically responds to stressful situations. It can help her learn how to release and control tension that leads to headaches. Massage : When done by a trained professional, along with a healthy diet and regular exercise, massage can help your child relax. It can ease muscle tension that may trigger headaches. Medications: Many of the medicines that treat adult headaches are fine in smaller doses to treat headaches in children and teens. But never give aspirin to a child under age 19. It can cause Reye's syndrome, a rare but fatal condition in young kids. Your child may need prescription medications to help certain headaches, especially migraine headaches. Some meds treat symptoms when they strike. Others help prevent future headaches. It can take some time to find a headache treatment that works. Tell your doctor what helps your child and what doesn't. Right away, start keeping a headache diary to help you track how well medication and therapy are working. Bring the diary to your child's follow-up appointments so the doctor can check it and tweak the treatment program, if necessary. If your child's symptoms get worse or happen more often even with treatment, ask the doctor to refer you to a headache specialist. They may get better as your child gets older. They might disappear and then return later in life. By middle school, many boys who've had migraine headaches outgrow them. But for girls, the headaches tend to happen more often as they grow up because of hormone changes."
201,"This serious condition makes the pressure inside your eye (your doctor may call it intraocular pressure, or IOP) go up suddenly. It can rise within a matter of hours. It happens when fluid in your eye can't drain the way it should. It isn't as common as other types of glaucoma, which cause pressure buildup much more slowly over time. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is caused by a rapid or sudden increase in pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure ( IOP). Fluid drains out of your eye through a system of canals. These canals live in a mesh of tissue between your iris (the colored part of your eye) and your cornea (the clear outer layer). When your iris and cornea move closer together, it âcloses the angleâ between them. When this happens suddenly, it's called an acute attack and is very painful. Acute angle closure glaucoma completely blocks your canals. It stops fluid from flowing through them, kind of like a piece of paper sliding over a sink drain. The pressure that builds up can damage your optic nerve. If you don't treat the problem quickly enough, you could lose your sight completely. You might have an attack of angle closure glaucoma if your eyes dilate (your pupil gets bigger) too much or too quickly. This can normally happen when you: Go into a dark room Get drops that dilate your eyes Are excited or stressed Take certain drugs like antidepressants, cold medications, or antihistamines Some health conditions can also cause angle closure glaucoma: Cataracts Ectopic lens (when your lens moves from where it should be) Diabetic retinopathy Ocular ischemia (narrowed blood vessels to the eye) Uveitis (eye inflammation) Tumors Women are 2 to 4 times more likely to get it than men. You're also more likely to have it if you're: Asian or Inuit Farsighted Between 55 and 65 Or if you: Have a family history of it Use medications that dilate your pupils Use other medications that cause your iris and cornea to come together, like sulfonamides, topiramate, or phenothiazines If you have acute angle closure glaucoma in one eye, you're also more likely to get it in the other. They come on quickly. You won't be able to ignore them. They include: Eye pain Severe headache Nausea or vomiting Very blurry or hazy vision Seeing rainbows or halos around lights Redness in the white part of the affected eye Pupils of different sizes Sudden loss of sight When your doctor examines you, she may also notice that your pupils no longer get smaller or bigger when she shines light on them. If you think you have acute angle closure glaucoma, you'll need to see an ophthalmologist right away -- it's an emergency. She'll examine you and ask about your symptoms. She may do one or more tests to find out more about what's going on inside your eye: Gonioscopy: The doctor uses a lens with a simple microscope called a slit lamp to look into your eye. A beam of light checks the angle between your iris and cornea and see how well fluid drains. Tonometry: This test uses a tool to measure the pressure inside your eye. Ophthalmoscopy: Your doctor checks for damage to your optic nerve with a small lighted device. The first thing your doctor will do to treat your acute angle closure attack is try to get rid of some of the pressure in your eye. She might use: Drops that narrow your pupil Medication to lowers the amount of fluid your eye makes Once your IOP has dropped a little, your doctor may use a laser to: Make a small hole in your iris. This is called a laser iridotomy, and it helps the fluid start flowing again inside your eye. It's an outpatient treatment, and takes a few minutes. Pull the edges of your iris away from your drainage canals. This called laser iridoplasty or gonioplasty. If you have cataracts, your doctor may consider surgery to replace the lens in your eye. This type of surgery can be harder to do when you're having an acute attack. Even if your acute angle closure glaucoma is in only one eye, your doctor will probably treat both eyes, just to be safe. The best way to prevent an acute angle closure glaucoma attack is to get your eyes checked regularly, especially if you're at high risk. Your doctor can keep tabs on pressure levels and how well fluid drains. If she thinks your risk is unusually high, she may suggest laser treatment to hold off an attack."
202,"The esophageal p H test is an outpatient procedure performed to measure the p H or amount of acid that flows into the esophagus from the stomach during a 24-hour period. The procedure is commonly used to help confirm the diagnosis of GERD or to identify the cause of various symptoms, including: Heartburn , primarily in patients who have had a normal endoscopy and who have failed medical treatment or may be considered as candidates for surgery Uncommon symptoms of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), such as chest pain, chronic cough, asthma, and other throat symptoms The test may also be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of current treatments for heartburn or reflux. This test is often recommended for those whose symptoms aren't helped by medications. The equipment used in the esophageal p H test consists of a small probe that is inserted through your nostril and positioned near the lower esophagus. The probe is plugged into a small unit (or monitor) worn on your belt or over your shoulder. A newer, wireless device may make monitoring the p H level easier: Instead of having to have a tube placed down your nose for 24 hours, your doctor will place a disposable capsule into the esophagus using an endoscope. The capsule then wirelessly transmits information for up to 48 hours to a receiver worn around the waist. With the touch of a button on your monitor, it will record the following information: The occurrence of symptoms The times when you eat and lie down A nurse will review the monitoring instructions with you. Be careful with the monitor and keep it dry at all times. Do not eat or drink for four to six hours before your esophageal p H test. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, have a lung or heart condition or any other diseases, or are allergic to any medications. There are several medications that may affect the results of an esophageal p H test. These include: Proton pump inhibitors: Dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant), Omeprazole ( Prilosec), Lansoprazole ( Prevacid), Esomeprazole ( Nexium), Rabeprazole ( Aciphex), and Pantoprazole ( Protonix) H2 blockers: ( Famotidine ( Pepcid) and Ranitidine ( Zantac) Antacids: Alka- Seltzer, Gaviscon, Maalox, Milk of Magnesia, Mylanta, Tums Calcium channel blockers: Nifedipine ( Adalat, Procardia), Diltiazem ( Cardizem), and Verapamil ( Verelan) Nitrates: Isordil, Isosorbide, Nitrobid, Nitrodisc, Nitroglycerin ( NTG), Nitropatch There are other drugs that may affect the test results. Talk to your doctor about all medications you are taking before undergoing the procedure. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor. If proton pump inhibitors need to be discontinued, you will take a week off these drugs before doing the test. Please note: Occasionally your doctor may ask you to continue a certain medication during the monitoring period to see if it is effective. Activity. Try to follow your usual routine during the esophageal p H test. Many people tend to reduce or change their activities during the monitoring period. However, such changes can affect reflux occurrence and make the results of the monitoring period less useful. Please note: Do not take a bath or shower during the monitoring period to avoid getting the equipment wet. Eating. Eat your regular meals at the usual times and eat the way you normally do. If you do not eat during the monitoring period, your stomach will not produce acid as usual, and the test results will not be accurate. Eat foods that tend to increase your symptoms (without making yourself miserable, of course). You may drink as much plain water as you want. Lying down. Remain upright throughout the day. Do not lie down until you go to bed, unless napping or lying down during the day is part of your normal daily routine. Medications. Continue following your doctor's recommendations regarding which medications to avoid during the esophageal p H test. Record your primary symptoms, as discussed with your doctor, by pressing the appropriate buttons on the monitor when the symptoms occur. Record the times when you are eating, drinking anything except water, or lying down (you do not have to be sleeping or intending to sleep when lying down). Record the following: The time when you start eating The time when you finish eating The time when you start lying down The time when you finish lying down At your next appointment, your doctor will discuss the results of your esophageal p H test with you. You may resume your normal diet and activities. You may feel a temporary soreness in your throat. Lozenges may help."
203,"There are several reasons why some people's teeth grow in crooked, overlapping, or twisted. Some people's mouths are too small for their teeth, which crowds the teeth and causes them to shift. In other cases, a person's upper and lower jaws aren't the same size or are malformed, resulting in either an overbite, when there is excessive protrusion of the upper jaw, or an under bite, when the lower jaw protrudes forward causing the lower jaw and teeth to extend out beyond the upper teeth. Most often crooked teeth, overbites, and underbites are inherited traits just as the color of your eyes or size of your hands. Other causes of misaligned bites are early loss of baby or adult teeth; improper fit of dental restorations (for example, fillings or crowns); gingivitis (gum disease); undue pressure on the teeth and gums; misalignment of the jaw after an injury; tumors of the mouth or jaw; or common oral health problems in children such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond the age of three, or prolonged use of a bottle. Crooked teeth and misaligned bites can: Interfere with proper chewing. Make keeping teeth clean more of a challenge, increasing the risk of tooth decay, cavities, and gingivitis. Strain the teeth, jaws, and muscles, increasing the risk of breaking a tooth. Make people feel self-conscious about their appearance and affect their self-esteem. While you can see for yourself if teeth are crooked, your dentist can determine if the problem warrants treatment. Your dentist will look for the following signs: Abnormal alignment of teeth Abnormal appearance of the face Difficulty or discomfort when chewing or biting Speech difficulties, including a lisp Your dentist will usually refer you to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of crooked teeth and misaligned jaws. The orthodontist will likely take X-rays, photographs of your face, and teeth impressions to determine if and what type of treatment is needed. X-rays provide information on the position of your teeth and roots and if any teeth have yet to come through the gums. Special cephalometrics or panoramic X-rays show the relationship of the teeth to the jaws and the jaws to the head. Your orthodontist may also want to take regular photographs of your face to further examine the relationship between the teeth, jaws, and head. Finally, impressions may be made of your teeth. This is done by having you bite down on a soft material that is later used to create an exact copy of your teeth. Once a diagnosis is made, your orthodontist can decide the best treatment for your teeth or misaligned bite. For some people, a removable retainer (to stabilize the new position of teeth) will be all that's needed to correct the problem. In very rare cases, removal of one or more teeth may be required if overcrowding is the main problem. For most people, braces are necessary to correct the problem. In rare and extreme cases, such as an extreme overbite or underbite, an operation may be necessary."
204,"If you're like most folks, when you hear that someone has lung cancer, you probably assume he's a smoker. But there's more to it than that. The truth is you can get the disease even if you've never put a cigarette to your lips. There are lots of reasons why this can happen, but if you can help cut down your risk. First, pay attention to some of the things that bring on lung cancer when you don't have the tobacco habit. Secondhand smoke. There are two types: the stuff a smoker breathes out and the cloud that drifts from a cigarette, pipe, or cigar. Both are bad for you. So even if you wouldn't dream of lighting up a cigarette, you still take in harmful chemicals when you're around someone who does. There are at least 70 kinds in secondhand smoke that can lead to cancer. There are no safe amounts, so try to avoid secondhand smoke as much as you can. Take a pledge to make your home and car tobacco-free zones. Radon. It's a gas that naturally forms from soil and rock. You can't see, smell, or taste it. Low levels of the stuff are a natural part of the air outdoors, but it's more likely to be a problem inside homes and buildings. It can creep in from the ground through cracks in the floors or walls. If you breathe in radon over long periods of time, you may end up with lung cancer. That's because it breaks down into tiny particles that can get into your lungs and damage cells there. The gas is the second most common cause of the disease besides smoking. You can check how much of it is in your home with a detection kit, or you can hire a professional to do it. If the levels are too high, it's a good idea to work with a contractor who has experience with this issue. He may seal cracks in your floors and walls and use other techniques to help lower the amount of the gas in your home. Asbestos. It's a group of minerals that was used in a lot of building supplies and products until researchers found it was harmful. When you breathe it in, the fibers get stuck deep in your lungs and over time may lead to lung cancer. The more you're in contact with asbestos, the higher your risk. It sometimes lurks in older homes in places like steam pipes or tiles. It's not a hazard unless the material gets damaged and releases fibers. Hire a trained professional if you need to repair or remove it. Genes. Sometimes changes to the DNA of your lung cells, known as ""mutations,"" can lead to cancer. There are several ways this can happen. For example, you may be born with problems in chromosome number 6 that make you more likely to get lung cancer. Or you may naturally have less of an ability to clear away chemicals from your body that can cause the disease. Another possibility: Your body may be unable to repair damaged DNA, which puts you at higher risk when you come into contact with chemicals that can cause lung cancer. There aren't any tests to check if you have any of these genetic problems. Your best bet is to avoid things that are known to increase your odds of getting the disease. Air pollution. In the U. S. dust, smoke, and chemicals in the air cause about 1%-2% of lung cancers. Researchers suspect that polluted air can cause changes in your DNA that may set the stage for a higher risk of the disease. The more air pollution you breathe in, the greater your chances of getting this type of cancer. Diet. What you put on your plate could affect the health of your lungs. A new study looked at how the glycemic index, which measures how quickly a carbohydrate raises your blood sugar, may be linked with lung cancer risk. Researchers in one study found that people who ate a diet with the highest glycemic index had a higher risk of getting the disease. Foods that may be troublesome are white bread, sugary cereal, white rice, pretzels, and popcorn. Healthier choices are whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, lentils, and most fruits. Experts aren't exactly sure why a high-glycemic diet may be connected with lung cancer. One possible reason is that it raises your blood sugar, which increases levels of proteins called insulin-like growth factors. Earlier studies suggest they may play a role in the development of the disease."
205,"Anyone with a colon can get colorectal cancer - a collective term that includes both colon cancer and rectal cancer. In the United States, it's the third leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women. It's estimated that in 2019, more than 145,600 new cases will be diagnosed and more than 50,600 people will die of this form of cancer. The lifetime chance of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 22 for men, and 1 in 24 for women. The American Cancer Society recommends colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45 for both women and men. Overall, only about 4.2% of men in the U. S. develop colorectal cancer, but several factors increase your risk: Age: Your risk of colorectal cancer goes up as you age. It is much more common to get it after age 50, but studies are showing a colon cancer rise in younger adults. Family History: If people in your immediate family or near relations had colorectal cancer at a young age, you should be screened earlier. Previous Colorectal Cancer: If you've had cancer removed already, you're at higher risk to develop a new one. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: If you have had a condition such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis for several years, your risk of colorectal cancer goes up. Certain lifestyle factors appear to raise the risk of colorectal cancer. They include: Drinking more than two alcoholic drinks per day Obesity Smoking Type 2 Diabetes A high-fat diet, with fat coming mostly from meat What Is Colorectal Cancer? The colon is the large intestine and the rectum is the last six inches of intestine, connecting the colon to the anus. In the U. S., for both sexes, about 72% of colorectal cancer cases occur in the colon and 28% in the rectum. Colorectal cancer usually develops slowly, beginning first as small growth called a polyp. Polyps may grow larger and eventually turn into cancer. The entire process of a polyp transforming into cancer usually takes several years. After cancer develops, it grows into the wall of the colon and eventually metastasizes, or spreads. Most of the time, this process is preventable with proper screening. Colorectal cancer symptoms may include a change in bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation), blood in the stool, black stools, abdominal pain, and weakness. The good news is that colorectal cancer is usually preventable. The number one way to prevent it is to get screened. Men and women should begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45. If you have colorectal cancer in your family or other risk factors, tell your doctor. You may need screening at a younger age. There are several options for screening to reduce colorectal cancer rates: Stool based tests include: Fecal immunochemical test ( FIT) yearly Guaiac fecal occult blood test yearly Stool DNA test every 3 years Structural examinations include: Colonoscopy every 10 years Flexible Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years. If you have a positive result on a screening test that is not a colonoscopy, further evaluation should be performed on a timely basis with a colonoscopy test to take a look at your entire colon. Studies show that men were more likely to develop polyps and cancer earlier than women. Therefore, early screening may be even more important for men's health. Some of the other things men can do today to start lowering colorectal cancer risk are: Eating like a hunter-gatherer, not a caveman. Cut back on the red meat, like burgers and steaks. Instead, fill up on more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. These changes alone could reduce your risk. Getting off the couch. Active men get less colorectal cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends 30 minutes of activity five days a week. Quitting smoking and limit drinking. Keep alcohol to one or two drinks a day. What Are the Treatments for Colorectal Cancer? The right colorectal cancer treatment is based on the degree of spreading, or stage: Cancer that is self-contained inside a polyp can often be cured with a colonoscopy. A snare on the end of the colonoscope cuts the entire cancer out. If colorectal cancer has spread into the bowel wall, surgery is needed. Part or all of the colon is removed (hemicolectomy or colectomy). Once the cancer has spread into the body, treatment becomes more complex. It will usually involve chemotherapy or other targeted colorectal cancer treatments. As you can see, the treatments get more aggressive and invasive as the cancer spreads. What Else Do I Need to Know about Colorectal Cancer? The greatest tragedy about colorectal cancer is that so many deaths from it are preventable. Sure, the testing can be uncomfortable or embarrassing, but you'll survive. On the other hand, you may not survive if you don't get screened. You owe it to yourself -- and your family -- to take colorectal cancer seriously."
206,"Web MD has been in touch with the CDC, the World Health Organization, and infectious disease experts to answer your bird fluquestions. Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a viral infection spread from bird to bird. Currently, a particularly deadly strain of bird flu -- H5 N1 -- continues to spread among poultry in Egypt and in certain parts of Asia. Technically, H5 N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI) virus. It's deadly to most birds. And it's deadly to humans and to other mammals that catch the virus from birds. Since the first human case in 1997, H5 N1 has killed nearly 60% of the people who have been infected. But unlike human flu bugs, H5 N1 bird flu does not spread easily from person to person. The very few cases of human-to-human transmission have been among people with exceptionally close contact, such as a mother who caught the virus while caring for her sick infant. Migrating water fowl -- most notably wild ducks -- are the natural carriers of bird flu viruses. It's suspected that infection can spread from wild fowl to domestic poultry. Because the disease has spread to wild birds, pigs, and even to donkeys, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to eradicate. As of 2011, the disease was well established in six nations: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. People catch bird flu by close contact with birds or bird droppings. Exactly what ""close contact"" means differs from culture to culture. Some people have caught H5 N1 from cleaning or plucking infected birds. In China, there have been reports of infection via inhalation of aerosolized materials in live bird markets. It's also possible that some people were infected after swimming or bathing in water contaminated with the droppings of infected birds. And some infections have occurred in people who handle fighting cocks. People don't catch the virus from eating fully cooked chicken or eggs. There have been a few cases where one infected person caught the bird flu virus from another person -- but only after close personal contact. So far, there has been no sustained human-to-human spread of H5 N1. As long as the bird flu virus doesn't change into a human flu virus, it won't spread far in people. But sometimes -- after close personal contact -- a person who gets bird flu does infect another person. In Indonesia in 2006, bird flu spread to eight members of one family. Seven of them died. It's not clear exactly how this happened. Family members likely had similar contacts with infected birds. They may also have shared genes that made them particularly susceptible to the virus. However, casual contact does not seem to be involved. During the fall of 2011, researchers from Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands made a stunning announcement. They had taught H5 N1 the nasty trick of going airborne and spreading among ferrets. Why ferrets? Nearly all human flu bugs spread easily among ferrets. They are commonly used in studies of human flu viruses. "" The virus is transmitted as efficiently as seasonal flu,"" lead researcher Ron Fouchier, Ph D, told New Scientist magazine. At the University of Wisconsin, a team led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, Ph D, DVM, also created an H5 N1 mutant that spreads among mammals. Both research teams were funded by the U. S. National Institute of Health. In a statement, the NIH says the research shows ""that the H5 N1 virus has greater potential than previously believed to gain a dangerous capacity to be transmitted among mammals, including perhaps humans."" The NIH funded the research because it felt there was a need for more information on how H5 N1 might learn to spread among humans. The U. S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity asked the study authors not to publish crucial information about the creation of the mutant viruses. The details will be made available only to qualified researchers. But the studies remain extremely controversial. Some senior scientists have said the mutant viruses should never have been created. They note that while the mutant viruses are housed in state-of-the-art containment facilities, the risk of escape is not zero. It's also not unprecedented. In 1977, an extinct H1 N1 flu bug re-emerged along the Russia/ China border. This so-called "" Russian flu"" led to widespread epidemics. Although officials denied it, many scientists believe the virus had escaped from a laboratory. The H5 N1 virus found in a wild bird in Washington state in late 2014 is slightly different from the Asian-origin avian H5 N1 virus that made humans sick. Various strains of bird flu pop up in U. S. poultry from time to time. When they do, all affected poultry flocks are culled. For example, in 2004 a highly dangerous bird flu strain appeared in a Texas chicken flock. The outbreak involved an H5 N2 virus (not the H5 N1 bird flu). By April 2004, the outbreak had been eradicated. No human infections were detected. While no human cases of bird flu have been seen in the U. S. or North America, the CDC is asking people who have traveled to East Asia to see a doctor if they develop flu-like symptoms. If so, it's important to tell the doctor about having visited these areas so the proper tests can be done. Bird flu symptoms in people can vary. Symptoms may start out as normal flu-like symptoms. This can worsen to become a severe respiratory disease that can be fatal. In February 2005, researchers in Vietnam reported human cases of bird flu in which the virus infected the brain and digestive tract of two children. Both died. These cases make it clear that bird flu in humans may not always look like typical cases of flu. If a person -- or a susceptible animal -- gets infected with bird flu and human flu at the same time, the bird and human flu viruses could swap genes. Even without swapping genes, H5 N1 could mutate into a form that more easily infects humans. The lab-created H5 N1 mutants remain in high-security labs. But the mutations needed to make H5 N1 an airborne, human virus already exist in H5 N1 viruses seen in nature. So far, the full set of mutations has not appeared in the same virus. It would be bad news if H5 N1 were to become as contagious as human flu. If it remained as lethal as it is now, the fatality rate would be about 60%. The deadliest flu bug in history, which caused the 1918 Great Pandemic, had a fatality rate of 2%. Even if it's a relatively mild new flu virus, it could spread rapidly across the globe. That's because most humans would have no immunity to the new kind of flu. During the 20th century, this happened three times. But just because it happened before doesn't mean it will happen this time. While experts say it's inevitable that sooner or later we'll see another flu pandemic, it's by no means certain that the current bird flu virus will be the cause. Even if a new human flu emerges, public health officials might be able to contain it. H5 N1 is susceptible to the newer flu drugs. And a vaccine already has been created and stockpiled by the World Health Organization. Yes. On April 17, 2007, the FDA announced its approval of the first vaccine to prevent human infection with one strain of the bird flu. The vaccine has been purchased by the U. S. federal government to be distributed by public health officials if needed. This vaccine will not be made commercially available to the general public. Other bird flu vaccines are being developed by other companies. And the World Health Organization has a stockpile of the vaccine, with plans to quickly produce more if needed. When given along with immunity-boosting agents called adjuvants, experimental H5 N1 vaccines offer good cross-protection against different H5 N1 variants. And several companies are working on universal flu vaccines and antivirals that would protect against all known strains of influenza. The flu drugs oseltamivir ( Tamiflu), zanamivir ( Relenza), or peramivir ( Rapivab) should work against bird flu, although more studies are needed. These drugs must be given soon after symptoms appear. Unfortunately, H5 N1 in humans can be a severe illness requiring hospitalization, isolation, and intensive care."
207,"Urinalysis is a series of tests on your pee. Doctors use it to check for signs of common conditions or diseases. Other names for it are urine test, urine analysis, and UA. You may have a urinalysis as part of a routine check of your overall health, for instance as part of an annual physical. Urinalysis is one way to find certain illnesses in their earlier stages. They include: Kidney disease Liver disease Diabetes Your doctor may also want to test your pee if you're getting ready to have surgery or are about to be admitted to the hospital. Urinalysis can be part of a pregnancy checkup, too. If you have symptoms of a kidney or urinary tract problem, you may have the tests to help find out what the problem is. Those symptoms include: Pain in your belly Pain in your back Pain when you pee or needing to go frequently Blood in your pee You might also have this test regularly if you have a condition such as a kidney disease that needs to be watched over time. There are three ways to analyze urine, and your test might use all of them. One is a visual exam, which checks the color and clarity. If your pee has blood in it, it might be red or dark brown. Foam can be a sign of kidney disease, while cloudy urine may mean you have an infection. A microscopic exam checks for things too small to be seen otherwise. Some of the things that shouldn't be in your urine that a microscope can find include: Red blood cells White blood cells Bacteria Crystals (clumps of minerals â a possible sign of kidney stones) The third part of urinalysis is the dipstick test, which uses a thin plastic strip treated with chemicals. It's dipped into your urine, and the chemicals on the stick react and change color if levels are above normal. Things the dipstick test can check for include: Acidity, or p H. If the acid is abnormal, you could have kidney stones, a urinary tract infection ( UTI) or another condition. Protein. This can be a sign your kidneys are not working right. Kidneys filter waste products out of your blood. Glucose. A high sugar content is a marker for diabetes. White blood cells. These are a sign of infection or inflammation, either in the kidneys or anywhere else along urinary tract. Nitrites. This means that there is an infection with certain kinds of bacteria. Bilirubin. If this waste product, which is normally eliminated by your liver, shows up, it may mean your liver isn't working properly. Blood in your urine. Sometimes this is a sign of infections or certain illnesses. If urinalysis is the only test you're having, you should be able to eat and drink normally before the procedure. Beets and food dyes can discolor your urine, so you may want to watch what you eat beforehand. Be sure to let your doctor know about all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. If you're menstruating, let the doctor know before the test. You'll either be asked to produce a urine sample at home and bring it with you, or you'll produce it at your doctor's office. The office will give you a container for the sample. The best results come from using what's known as the âclean-catchâ method. Here are the steps: Wash the area around the urinary opening. Start to pee into the toilet. Stop midstream. Let 1 to 2 ounces flow into the container. Finish peeing in the toilet. Follow your doctor's directions for handing over the sample. For babies and other people unable to provide a sample this way, a doctor may have to insert a soft, narrow tube called a catheter through the urinary opening and into the bladder. This test offers warning signs but can't tell your doctor for sure that anything is wrong with you. The results may be a clue that you need more tests and follow-up."
208,"Hypertension symptoms? Often there aren't any. High blood pressure is often called the ""silent"" disease, because it may have no noticeable symptoms. If undetected and untreated, hypertension can cause heart disease (including congestive heart failure and heart attack), stroke, and kidney disease. That's why it is important to have regular physical examinations to make sure your blood pressure is within the normal range. This is especially important if your blood pressure has ever been high, if you have a family history of hypertension, or if you are gaining weight. If you are being treated for high blood pressure, your doctor can answer any questions or concerns you may have during your regular visits. However, there may be situations that warrant a call to your doctor. For example: If you aren't responding to the treatment your doctor prescribed and your blood pressure is still high If you have certain symptoms, including fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, headache, excessive sweating, palpitations or irregular heart beats, problems with your vision, or confusion; these may be serious and should warrant prompt medical attention. They could be from uncontrolled high blood pressure or from medication side effects. If you have any concerns about your condition, don't hesitate to call your doctor."
209,"For more than three decades, care for small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC) remained mostly the same. That's changing now -- doctors have a new option called immunotherapy. This line of treatment uses your body's own immune system to fight cancer. What Is Immunotherapy? The immune system is your body's defense against harmful substances. It attacks foreign particles, like germs and viruses. But cancer can confuse your body. As cells change and grow out of control, your immune system may not think them as a threat. Scientists have developed drugs to help your immune system target and destroy cancerous cells. They include: Immune checkpoint inhibitors: Some immune cells have proteins that act as off switches. These âcheckpointsâ prevent them from killing cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors target these proteins and allow immune cells to attack the cancer. Cancer vaccines: These substances kick-start an immune system response. They can prevent or treat certain cancers. Scientists are beginning to study vaccines for SCLC. Which Drugs Treat SCLC? There are a few FDA-approved immunotherapy drugs for SCLC. Nivolumab ( Opdivo) and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda). You might take these immune checkpoint inhibitors if your cancer doesn't respond or returns after treatment with a certain chemotherapy. Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq). You might take this immune checkpoint inhibitor along with chemotherapy. When Do You Get Immunotherapy? Depending on how much your cancer has spread, your cancer doctor will usually recommend treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. But SCLC is an aggressive disease that grows quickly. It often becomes resistant to the chemotherapy drugs. Most of the time, the cancer returns. That's when it's time to try immunotherapy. Because scientists are still studying the drugs, doctors are careful about when to prescribe them. They can cause serious side effects, like inflammation of the organs. Your doctor will weigh the pros and cons. Most people get immunotherapy after two or more rounds of chemotherapy. How Do You Get the Treatment? You go to your doctor's office, a clinic, or the outpatient unit of a hospital. An IV will deliver the immunotherapy into your vein. The process usually takes around an hour. Depending on the drug, you'll receive treatment every few weeks. Your doctor will decide how long you'll get this medication. Usually the goal of is to prevent the cancer from getting worse instead of curing the disease."
210,"Pustular psoriasis is a skin disease. You'll see white bumps filled with pus near or inside red skin blotches. These are called pustules, and they can hurt and be scaly, flaky, or itchy. It's most likely to affect: The palms of your hands The soles of your feet Your fingers and toes Even though you see pus on your bumps, it's not an infection. You can't catch pustular psoriasis from someone else or give it to others. Pustular psoriasis usually happens to adults -- it's rare for kids to have it. It can run in families. You can get pustular psoriasis either on its own or with another kind of psoriasis called plaque psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Note the clearly defined, raised bumps on the skin that are filled with pus (pustules). The skin under and around these bumps is red. There are three types of pustular psoriasis, based on where the blister outbreaks are or how fast they popped up. Palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP): Blisters form on small areas of your body, usually your palms or the soles of your feet. These pus-filled spots can turn brown, peel off, or crust over. Your skin can crack, too. This type of psoriasis may come and go. People who smoke are more likely to get this form. Acropustulosis: Small, very painful lesions pop up on your fingertips or toes. The pain can make it hard to use your fingers or toes. In rare cases, it can cause nail or even bone damage. Generalized or Von Zumbusch: Red, painful, tender skin blotches show up over a wide area of your body, and pus-filled blisters pop up soon after. Your skin may be very itchy. You also might be very tired or have fever, chills, dehydration, nausea, weak muscles, headache, joint pain, a fast pulse, or weight loss. This is a rare, serious disease -- see your doctor right away if you have these symptoms. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. Your immune system usually sends white blood cells to fight off disease in your body. But in this case, they attack your own skin by mistake. A few things can trigger psoriasis flares: Medications, such as steroids Something that irritates your skin, like a topical cream or harsh skin care product Too much sunlight Stress Pregnancy Infection Hormones A mutation, or change, in one of two specific genes ( IL36 RN or CARD14), may make you more likely to get pustular psoriasis. If you have one of these gene mutations, one of those triggers could set off a flare. You'll see a dermatologist (skin doctor) who will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and any family history of psoriasis. She may need to take a small sample of your inflamed skin to look at under a microscope. That's called a biopsy. If you have a severe flare, she may also test your blood for signs of high white cell counts; signs that your kidney and liver are working the way they should; and whether you have healthy levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphate. The goal of treatment is to ease your symptoms and control outbreaks. What you take may depend on your type of pustular psoriasis. Small, local outbreak: Your doctor may try a topical steroid cream first to treat the sores. Coal tar or salicylic acid creams can help with scaly skin. You'll slather on lotions to soothe and prevent cracked skin. Then you'll slip on cotton gloves or socks to hold the moisture in. PPP and acropustulosis outbreaks can be stubborn. Your doctor may try ultraviolet light treatments on the inflamed skin. This is called phototherapy. Oral drugs like methotrexate or cyclosporine may help calm down your immune system. Acitretin ( Soriatane) is another drug that can slow skin outbreaks. It's a retinoid, or a synthetic form of vitamin A. All these drugs can have serious side effects, so you may need to switch treatments from time to time. If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes your psoriasis harder to treat. Widespread outbreak: If you have generalized or Von Zumbusch psoriasis, get medical care right away. You'll need fluids, along with treatments to prevent infection, ease your fever, and calm inflamed, broken skin. While you're in the hospital, you need to rest, stay hydrated, and keep cool. Your doctor may try acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, steroids, or biologics (drugs made from living cells) like etanercept or infliximab to get your flare under control. Once your skin redness and pustule outbreaks have calmed down, you can also try PUVA, where you take a drug called psoralen and then beam ultraviolet light at the affected area of your skin. Sometimes, one treatment doesn't do the trick. You may need to combine one or more to feel better."
211,"Stress fractures are some of the most common sports injuries. They are tiny breaks in the bone, usually caused by repetitive stress from activities like running. Although they can be quite painful, they usually heal themselves if rested for a few months. Many different sports raise the risk of stress fractures. Activities that require running and jumping may cause fractures in the legs or feet. More than half of all adult and adolescent stress fractures occur in the lower leg bones. Of these, fractures of the tibia -- the long bone of our lower leg -- are the most common at about 24% of all stress fractures. Other sports that require repetitive movements -- like pitching or rowing -- can result in stress fractures of the humerus (arm bone), but these are much more rare. Stress fractures are much more likely to develop in people who have just started a new exercise or abruptly stepped up the intensity of their work out. When the muscles aren't conditioned, they tire easily and can't support and cushion the bones as well. Increased pressure is exerted directly on the bones, which can lead to a fracture. Stress fractures seem to be more common in women. Other risk factors for stress fractures include: drinking more than10 alcoholic drinks a week, smoking, running more than 25 miles a week, osteoporosis, eating disorders and low levels of vitamin D. Any anatomical abnormalities -- like fallen arches -- can distribute stress unequally through the feet and legs. This raises the risk of stress fractures. So can poor-quality equipment, like worn-out running shoes. Unfortunately, stress fractures tend to recur. About 60% of people who have a stress fracture have had one previously."
212,"What you eat is really important when you have cancer. Your body needs enough calories and nutrients to stay strong. But the disease can make it hard to get what you need, which can be different before, during, and after treatment. And sometimes, you just won't feel like eating. You don't need a drastic diet makeover. Just a few simple tricks to make good-for-you foods easy and appetizing. Start focusing on healthy foods even before you begin your treatment. You don't know how it will affect you or what kind of side effects you might have. That's why it's a good idea to get good nutrition now. It can help you feel better and your body stay strong. It's also a good time to plan for the days when you won't feel like making anything to eat. Fill your fridge and pantry with healthy foods, especially those that need very little (or no) cooking. Nuts, applesauce, yogurt, pre-chopped veggies, and microwaveable brown rice or other whole grains are easy options. Make batches of some of your favorite entrees and freeze them, too. You may also want to line up some friends and family who can bring you meals for the first days or weeks of your therapy. You may have days when you feel hungry, and others when food is the last thing you want. On good days, eat lots of protein and healthy calories. That will keep your body strong and help repair damage from your treatment. High-protein foods include: Lean meat, chicken, and fish Eggs Beans, nuts, and seeds Cheese, milk, and yogurt Try to eat at least 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables a day. Include dark green and deep yellow veggies, and citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruits. Colorful foods like these have many healthy nutrients. Just be sure to wash them thoroughly. Drink plenty of liquids all day. Water is a great choice. Try fresh-squeezed juice, too. It gives you some extra vitamins along with the liquid your body needs to stay hydrated. It's also key that you don't eat raw or undercooked meat, fish, and poultry. Don't eat foods and beverages that are unpasteurized. Eat when you're hungry. If that's in the morning, make breakfast your biggest meal. Drink meal replacements later if your appetite fades as the day goes on. If meals are a struggle, eat five or six small ones instead of two or three big ones during the day. Have small, healthy snacks on hand, too. Yogurt, cereal, cheese and crackers, and soup are all good choices. If you're having chemotherapy, a snack or small meal right before a session might keep nausea away. Many side effects of cancer treatments can make it hard to get enough to eat. Your diet may help you get past some of the most common issues. Nausea/vomiting: Avoid high-fat, greasy, or spicy foods, or those with strong smells. Eat dry foods like crackers or toast every few hours. Sip clear liquids like broths, sports drinks, and water. Mouth or throat problems: For sores, pain, or trouble swallowing, stick with soft foods. Avoid anything rough or scratchy, and spicy or acidic foods. Eat meals lukewarm (not hot or cold). And use a straw for soups or drinks. Diarrhea and constipation: For diarrhea, it's really important to stay hydrated. Drink lots of liquids, and cut back on high-fiber foods like whole grains and vegetables. If you're constipated, slowly add more high-fiber foods to your diet. Plenty of liquids is key for this problem, too. Change in taste: Treatment can have a funny effect on your taste buds. Things you didn't like before might taste good now. So be open to new foods. See if you like sour or tart flavors like ginger or pomegranates. Spices such as rosemary, mint, and oregano might help you enjoy other foods, too. Plenty of people tout ""special"" diets that they say will help treat cancer or keep it from coming back. Maybe you've heard that you should go vegan, vegetarian, or start a raw diet. Before you make any major changes, talk to your doctor. There's no diet that can cure cancer. There's also no good research that shows that any eating plan, like a vegetarian diet, for example, can lower the chance of cancer coming back. Your best bet is to stick with a balanced diet with lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Limit your sugar, caffeine, salt, and alcohol."
213,"Kicking the prescription drug abuse habit -- or any other addiction -- is a major achievement. You have a lot to be proud of, yet you still have some work ahead of you. Detox is only the start of a long process through which you'll learn to manage drug cravings and avoid relapse. Counseling is a mainstay of drug abuse treatment for many people. Cognitive behavioral therapy, family counseling, and other types of therapy can help you stay clean. Psychotherapy can also treat the other mental health conditions that often play a role in prescription drug abuse. Opioid addiction is more than a physical dependence on drugs. Even after detox, when your body is no longer hooked, you're at high risk for relapse. Certain psychological and social factors can be powerful triggers that lead to relapse: Stress, especially sudden life stresses Cues in the environment, like visiting a neighborhood Social networks, like spending time with friends who continue to use drugs These things can create a strong ongoing urge to use again. Counseling helps you escape cravings and learn to manage what life throws at you without drugs. Several counseling therapies treat prescription drug abuse. No one method is known to be better than another. Likewise, no one approach works for everyone with opiate addiction. The right treatment plan will be tailored to your addiction and individual needs. While any counseling therapy for drug abuse treatment is better than none, group therapy is generally preferred over individual therapy. In group therapy, you're more likely to be both challenged and supported by peers who are also going through drug rehab. Twelve-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous are also peer support groups. They can be a useful part of your recovery program. But keep in mind that they aren't led by a trained psychotherapist and, thus, aren't the same as group therapy. Individual therapy can help when you have depression, bipolar disorder, or another significant mental health condition that requires treatment in its own right, separate from your addiction. Residential therapy separates you from the place and things that led you to use drugs. You'll go away to a special facility for a period of weeks to months. While there, you'll learn new habits or skills for sober living. While this approach works well in the short term, there's no proof it helps you stay away from drugs any longer than outpatient programs, which you'll attend for anywhere from a few hours to several hours a day while you live somewhere else. In fact, relapse may be more likely if you go from a controlled, inpatient environment back to your home, where it's easy to start using again. Also, residential drug abuse treatment programs are expensive. They can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and insurance plans don't always cover them. Outpatient treatment programs are the usual setting for prescription drug abuse treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, teaches you how to recognize moods, thoughts, and situations that fire up drug cravings. A therapist teaches you how to avoid these triggers. You'll learn to replace negative thoughts and feelings with healthy ones that will help you stay clean. The skills you'll learn can last a lifetime, so this is a powerful treatment method. But not all therapists are trained in cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. This method gives you positive incentives to stay clean. Vouchers for goods and services, or privileges in a more rigid treatment setting, are common. In this method, therapists try to motivate you and help you maintain your abstinence from drugs. If you're prompted by love of family or returning to work, these may become the focus of your treatment. Drug abuse and addiction don't only affect your life; your whole family is transformed. Successful treatment requires strong relationships with family and friends. Various counseling methods include your spouse and other family members. Why try family or couples therapy? Family members can be a powerful force for change in your life. Including them can make you more likely to stay in therapy. They can begin to heal the damage your addiction has caused in their life. Studies show family therapy results in lower relapse rates, increased happiness in the family, and helps children of addicted parents manage their situation. Narcotics Anonymous ( NA) is an international network of community-based meetings for people recovering from drug addiction. It's modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA), so it's a 12-step program with a defined process for overcoming addiction. It's a It's an abstinence-based program. In principle, NA is opposed to the use of maintenance therapy. Methadone Anonymous is a 12-step program that acknowledges the value of methadone and other medications in recovery from narcotic addiction. Opioid addiction is a chronic illness. People who have it are likely to relapse. Once you're through detox, you'll probably need lifelong treatment that includes medication and counseling."
214,"Otosclerosis is a rare condition that causes hearing loss. It happens when a small bone in your middle ear -- usually the one called the stapes -- gets stuck in place. Most of the time, this happens when bone tissue in your middle ear grows around the stapes in a way it shouldn't. Your stapes bone has to vibrate for you to hear well. When it can't do that, sound can't travel from your middle ear to your inner ear. That makes it hard for you to hear. Otosclerosis affects more than 3 million Americans. Experts aren't sure exactly what causes it. But they do know: It usually starts when you're young. You can develop otosclerosis between the ages of 10 and 45, but you're most likely to get it during your 20s. Symptoms usually are at their worst in your 30s. It often runs in families. About half of all people with otosclerosis have a gene that's linked to the condition. But even if you have the gene, you won't necessarily get it. Both men and women get otosclerosis. Women, though, have a higher risk. Experts aren't sure why, but if you're a woman and develop otosclerosis during pregnancy, you're likely to lose your hearing faster than if you were a man or you weren't pregnant. Caucasians are most likely to get it. About 10% develop otosclerosis. It's less common in other groups and rare for African- Americans. Certain medical problems can raise your chances of otosclerosis. For example, if you had measles at any time, your risk may go up. Stress fractures to the bony tissue around your inner ear also might make it more likely to happen. And immune disorders, in which your immune system mistakenly attacks parts of your body, also can be linked to the condition. The main symptom of otosclerosis is hearing loss. At first, you may notice that you can't hear low-pitched sounds or people whispering. This usually gets worse over time. Most people with otosclerosis have hearing loss in both ears. About 10% to 15% have hearing loss in just one ear. Other symptoms include: Dizziness or balance problems Tinnitus, or ringing, roaring, or hissing in your ears Sometimes tinnitus can be a problem after you have ear surgery to treat otosclerosis. If you notice you have trouble hearing, see an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT). He'll look closely at your ear, test your hearing, and ask about your family health history. In some cases, he may recommend a computerized tomography ( CT) scan. A series of X-rays are taken at different angles and put together to make a more detailed image. If your otosclerosis is mild, your doctor may take a watch-and-wait approach and test your hearing regularly. She might also recommend that you get a hearing aid. Some doctors may treat otosclerosis with sodium fluoride, a dietary supplement. But this hasn't been proven to work. If your hearing loss is serious or gets worse, your doctor may recommend a surgery called a stapedectomy. With this procedure, a surgeon puts a device in your middle ear that moves the stuck stapes bone, letting sound waves travel to your inner ear so you can hear better. A stapedectomy can help some people. But like all types of surgery, it has risks. In rare cases, it can make hearing loss worse. If you have otosclerosis in both ears, a surgeon will operate on one ear at a time. After the first one, you'll need to wait at least 6 months for it to be done on your other ear."

A child with this disorder may display a pattern of disruptive and violent behavior and have problems following rules. It is not uncommon for children and teens to have behavior-related problems at some time during their development. However, the behavior is considered to be a conduct disorder when it is long-lasting and when it violates the rights of others, goes against accepted norms of behavior and disrupts the child's or family's everyday life. Symptoms of conduct disorder vary depending on the age of the child and whether the disorder is mild, moderate, or severe. In general, symptoms of conduct disorder fall into four general categories: Aggressive behavior: These are behaviors that threaten or cause physical harm and may include fighting, bullying, being cruel to others or animals, using weapons, and forcing another into sexual activity. Destructive behavior: This involves intentional destruction of property such as arson (deliberate fire-setting) and vandalism (harming another person's property). Deceitful behavior: This may include repeated lying, shoplifting, or breaking into homes or cars in order to steal. Violation of rules: This involves going against accepted rules of society or engaging in behavior that is not appropriate for the person's age. These behaviors may include running away, skipping school, playing pranks, or being sexually active at a very young age. In addition, many children with conduct disorder are irritable, have low self-esteem, and tend to throw frequent temper tantrums. Some may abuse drugs and alcohol. Children with conduct disorder often are unable to appreciate how their behavior can hurt others and generally have little guilt or remorse about hurting others. The exact cause of conduct disorder is not known, but it is believed that a combination of biological, genetic, environmental, psychological, and social factors play a role. Biological: Some studies suggest that defects or injuries to certain areas of the brain can lead to behavior disorders. Conduct disorder has been linked to particular brain regions involved in regulating behavior, impulse control, and emotion. Conduct disorder symptoms may occur if nerve cell circuits along these brain regions do not work properly. Further, many children and teens with conduct disorder also have other mental illnesses, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD), learning disorders, depression, substance abuse, or an anxiety disorder, which may contribute to the symptoms of conduct disorder. Genetics: Many children and teens with conduct disorder have close family members with mental illnesses, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders. This suggests that a vulnerability to conduct disorder may be at least partially inherited. Environmental: Factors such as a dysfunctional family life, childhood abuse, traumatic experiences, a family history of substance abuse, and inconsistent discipline by parents may contribute to the development of conduct disorder. Psychological: Some experts believe that conduct disorders can reflect problems with moral awareness (notably, lack of guilt and remorse) and deficits in cognitive processing. Social: Low socioeconomic status and not being accepted by their peers appear to be risk factors for the development of conduct disorder. It is estimated that 2%-16% of children in the U. S. have conduct disorder. It is more common in boys than in girls and most often occurs in late childhood or the early teen years. As with adults, mental illnesses in children are diagnosed based on signs and symptoms that suggest a particular problem. If symptoms of conduct disorder are present, the doctor may begin an evaluation by performing complete medical and psychiatric histories. A physical exam and laboratory tests (for example, neuroimaging studies, blood tests) may be appropriate if there is concern that a physical illness might be causing the symptoms. The doctor will also look for signs of other disorders that often occur along with conduct disorder, such as ADHD and depression. If the doctor cannot find a physical cause for the symptoms, he or she will likely refer the child to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist, mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses in children and teens. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a child for a mental disorder. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on reports of the child's symptoms and his or her observation of the child's attitudes and behavior. The doctor will often rely on reports from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults because children may withhold information or otherwise have trouble explaining their problems or understanding their symptoms. Treatment for conduct disorder is based on many factors, including the child's age, the severity of symptoms, as well as the child's ability to participate in and tolerate specific therapies. Treatment usually consists of a combination of the following: Psychotherapy : Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) is aimed at helping the child learn to express and control anger in more appropriate ways. A type of therapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to reshape the child's thinking (cognition) to improve problem solving skills, anger management, moral reasoning skills, and impulse control. Family therapy may be used to help improve family interactions and communication among family members. A specialized therapy technique called parent management training ( PMT) teaches parents ways to positively alter their child's behavior in the home. Medication : Although there is no medication formally approved to treat conduct disorder, various drugs may be used (off label) to treat some of its distressing symptoms (impulsivity, aggression), as well as any other mental illnesses that may be present, such as ADHD or major depression. If your child is displaying symptoms of conduct disorder, it is very important that you seek help from a qualified doctor. A child or teen with conduct disorder is at risk for developing other mental disorders as an adult if left untreated. These include antisocial and other personality disorders, mood or anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Children with conduct disorder are also at risk for school-related problems, such as failing or dropping out, substance abuse, legal problems, injuries to self or others due to violent behavior, sexually transmitted diseases, and suicide. Treatment outcomes can vary greatly, but early intervention may help to reduce the risk for incarcerations, mood disorders, and the development of other comorbidities such as substance abuse. Although it may not be possible to prevent conduct disorder, recognizing and acting on symptoms when they appear can minimize distress to the child and family, and prevent many of the problems associated with the condition. In addition, providing a nurturing, supportive, and consistent home environment with a balance of love and discipline may help reduce symptoms and prevent episodes of disturbing behavior."
216,"Older people have fewer headaches than younger ones, and women have more headaches than men through their lives. For example, between ages 21 and 34, the prevalence of headaches is 92% in women and 74% in men; after age 75, the prevalence drops to 55% and 21%, respectively. Migraines tend to disappear with age, too. At age 70, only 10% of women and 5% of men experience them. But some headaches in older age can indicate a much more serious medical condition. Late-life migraine accompaniments are defined as passing neurological symptoms that can affect vision, speech, movement, and behavior. They are similar or identical to migraine ""aura,"" the symptoms the precede a migraine. However, headache is associated with only 50% of cases and may be mild. Migraine accompaniments may consist of visual symptoms such as transient blindness, homonymous hemianopsia (loss of vision on one side of one's visual field), and blurring of vision; paresthesias (numbness, tingling, pins-and-needles sensation), a heavy feeling in an extremity like an arm or leg; brain stem and cerebellar dysfunction such as ataxia (clumsiness), hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in ears), vertigo (sense of room spinning), syncope (loss of consciousness); and disturbances of speech, such as dysarthria (slurred speech) or aphasia (loss of ability to speak). They may come in succession. These symptoms can also be seen in strokes, transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs), or some types of seizures, so the doctor will run tests to be sure of the cause. If the episodes are frequent, preventive treatment can be considered with medications such as divalproex sodium ( Depakote, Depakene), topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax, Trokendi XR),metoprolol ( Lopresor, Toprol XL), or propranolol ( Inderal LA, Inno Pran XL). Your doctor will talk to you about best options for treating acute symptoms. Headaches commonly accompany stroke. In a study of 163 patients who'd had a stroke, 60% reported a headache with the stroke, especially women and those with a history of headaches. Up to 46% reported having an incapacitating headache; most said the headache was mild to moderately painful. The headaches are equally likely to come on quickly or slowly. Although there are many causes of head trauma, falling is a particular problem. Approximately 30% of people ages 65 and older fall at least once a year. If the person has dementia, he might not remember having fallen. Subdural hematomas, or bleeding on the brain, can result from a mild head injury. These brain traumas can be life-threatening or go away on their own. Headaches are present in up to 90% of patients with head trauma, including subdural hematomas. The headaches can range from mild to severe, can be intermittent or constant, and can happen on one or both sides of the head. Coughing, straining, or exercise can make them worse, and sometimes there's vomiting and nausea. Headaches are the most common symptom of temporal (giant cell) arteritis, or TA, a disease that causes your arteries -- blood vessels that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body -- to swell and narrow. It usually happens to the large and medium-sized temporal arteries that run along both sides of your head. The cells of these inflamed arteries look huge under a microscope; hence, the condition's name. TA is more common in people older than age 50. The headache pain is described most often as throbbing, and may be intermittent or constant. The headache can be on one or both sides of the head, typically near the temples. But it can be over the forehead or even the back of the head. About half of the people with TA also get bad pain in the jaw with chewing. When there is pressure on the trigeminal nerve, which controls facial feeling, it can cause excruciating pain in the lower part of the face, around the nose, and above the eye. The neuralgia, or nerve pain, can be triggered by doing ordinary things â brushing your teeth, chewing, or blowing your nose. In a small number of cases, the pain is caused by a tumor pressing on the trigeminal nerve. The condition is more common in people older than age 50 and is seen more in women than men. It may run in families. Risk factors including hypertension and multiple sclerosis. Medications that may help ease symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia, alone or sometimes in combination, are anticonvulsants or seizure medicines that include carbamazepine ( Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol); oxcarbazepine ( Oxtellar XR and Trileptal); baclofen and phenytoin ( Dilantin, Phenytek); clonazepam ( Klonopin); divalproex sodium ( Depakote, Depakene); topiramate ( Quedexy TR, Topamax, Trokendi XR); lamotrigine ( Lamicatal); gabapentin ( Horizant, Neurontin); and pimozide ( Orap). About 30% of people don't respond to medication but may respond to surgery. Brain surgery can help move the trigeminal nerve from a nearby blood vessel and correct the problem. Another technique damages the nerve to prevent it from causing facial pain. Postherpetic neurlagia is nerve pain that lingers after an outbreak of shingles, a rash also known as herpes zoster that may also affect the face. Shingles has the same origin as chickenpox, caused as it is by the varicella virus. It is characterized by sores that form and crust over 3 to 4 weeks. It can cause nerve damage that leads to burning, shooting and tingling pain for 3 months or longer (called postherpetic neuralgia). The persistence of pain from shingles is more common among people older than age 80. Shingles that involves the face nearly doubles the risk of developing facial posterherpetic neuralgia. Treatment includes anticonvulsants, antidepressants, aspirin, NSAIDs, and creams. Hypnic headache is a rare disorder that occurs in men and women ages 40 to 79. The headache occurs only during sleep and awakens a person at a consistent time. The headache can be on one or both sides of the head, can throb or not, and can range from mild to severe. They typically last for 2-3 hours (but can last up to 6 hours), and they can happen nightly for years. Treatment might include caffeine pills before bed or a one or two cups of coffee, lithium carbonate, indomethacin, atenolol, melatonin, cyclobenzaprine, or prednisone. To make a diagnosis of hypnic headaches, the doctor will rule out drug withdrawal, temporal arteritis, sleep apnea, brain trauma, migraines, and other causes."
217,"Many new mothers struggle with the decision to breastfeed or bottle feed their new baby. Here's some guidance to help you choose what's right for you. Breast milk is the perfect food for baby, with numerous advantages over baby formula, especially in the first four months or so. Here's why: It's always available. It's free. It contains active infection-fighting white blood cells and natural chemicals that give increased protection against infections in the first months, when these can be the most serious. It can help prevent SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. It contains the perfect proportion of nutrients that your baby needs, including protein, carbohydrates, fat, and calcium. It is easily digestible. It may protect against allergies and asthma in the future. It may decrease a baby's risk of obesity in the future. It may contain some fatty acids that promote brain development. Breastfeeding can help new mothers lose weight more easily. Additionally, there probably are other beneficial components of breast milk that we are not aware of and so are not added to formula. With all these advantages of breast milk, should you feel guilty if you choose not to breastfeed? Absolutely not! Infant formulas have gotten better and better at matching the ingredients and their proportions to that of human milk. While breastfed babies may have relatively fewer infections, the vast majority of infants won't get a serious infection in the first months whether breast- or bottle fed. A happy, unstressed mother is the best mother. If you feel that bottle feeding best fits your needs, then it's the best for meeting your baby's needs as well. There's no need to heat the formula for your baby. Drinking it at room temperature is fine. Once a baby has sipped from formula, it should be discarded. You can, though, save unused formula that baby hasn't sipped from for the next feeding. Don't hesitate to pick a less expensive brand of formula if finances are a factor. Most formulas are pretty much the same. More expensive does not necessarily mean better. Avoid low-iron formula. Most formulas on the market have adequate iron. Just be sure to check that it's iron fortified when you buy a formula. There is a lot of evidence that iron deficiency in the first years adversely affects brain development. And side effects from iron (gas, constipation, discomfort) while much discussed, are actually very rare. Pick whichever type of formula -- powder, concentrate, or ready-to-feed -- best suits your needs. There is no nutritional difference between them. You may want to keep in mind that powdered formula is the least expensive, though. Choose cow's milk formula over soy to start with."
218,"When your doctor says you have an inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) -- like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis -- he may suggest a low-residue diet. The basic idea is that you'll eat foods that are easy to digest and cut back on those that aren't. It limits high-fiber foods, like whole-grain breads and cereals, nuts, seeds, raw or dried fruits, and vegetables. "" Residue"" is undigested food, including fiber, that makes up stool. The goal of the diet is to have fewer, smaller bowel movements each day. That will ease symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, gas, and stomach cramping. Your doctor may recommend this diet for a little while when you have a flare, or after surgery to help with recovery. Grains Refined or enriched white breads and plain crackers, such as saltines or Melba toast (no seeds) Cooked cereals, like farina, cream of wheat, and grits Cold cereals, like puffed rice and corn flakes White rice, noodles, and refined pasta Fruits and Vegetables The skin and seeds of many fruits and vegetables are full of fiber, so you need to peel them and avoid the seeds. These vegetables are OK: Well-cooked fresh vegetables or canned vegetables without seeds, like asparagus tips, beets, green beans, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, squash (no seeds), and pumpkin Cooked potatoes without skin Tomato sauce (no seeds) Fruits on the good list include: Ripe bananas Soft cantaloupe Honeydew Canned or cooked fruits without seeds or skin, like applesauce or canned pears Avocado Milk and Dairy They're OK in moderation. Milk has no fiber, but it may trigger symptoms like diarrhea and cramping if you're lactose intolerant. If you are (meaning you have trouble processing dairy foods), you could take lactase supplements or buy lactose-free products. Meats Animal products don't have fiber. You can eat beef, lamb, chicken, fish (no bones), and pork, as long as they're lean, tender, and soft. Eggs are OK, too. Fats, Sauces, and Condiments These are all on the diet: Margarine, butter, and oils Mayonnaise and ketchup Sour cream Smooth sauces and salad dressing Soy sauce Clear jelly, honey, and syrup Sweets and Snacks You can satisfy your sweet tooth on a low-residue diet. These desserts and snacks are OK to eat in moderation: Plain cakes and cookies Gelatin, plain puddings, custard, and sherbet Ice cream and ice pops Hard candy Pretzels (not whole-grain varieties) Vanilla wafers Drinks Safe beverages include: Decaffeinated coffee, tea, and carbonated beverages (caffeine can upset your stomach) Milk Juices made without seeds or pulp, like apple, no-pulp orange, and cranberry Strained vegetable juices On this plan, you'll stay away from: Coconut, seeds, and nuts, including those found in bread, cereal, desserts, and candy Whole-grain products, including breads, cereals, crackers, pasta, rice, and kasha Raw or dried fruits, like prunes, berries, raisins, figs, and pineapple Most raw vegetables Certain cooked vegetables, including peas, broccoli, winter squash, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, corn (and cornbread), onions, cauliflower, potatoes with skin, and baked beans Beans, lentils, and tofu Tough meats with gristle, and smoked or cured deli meats Cheese with seeds, nuts, or fruit Crunchy peanut butter, jam, marmalade, and preserves Pickles, olives, relish, sauerkraut, and horseradish Popcorn Fruit juices with pulp or seeds, prune juice, and pear nectar As long as you follow the general guidelines for the diet, you can mix and match as much as you'd like. There are many meal options to choose from on a low-residue diet: Breakfast Decaffeinated coffee with cream and sugar Cup of juice, such as no-pulp orange juice, apple juice, or cranberry juice Farina Scrambled eggs Waffles, French toast, or pancakes White-bread toast with margarine and grape jelly (no seeds) Lunch Baked chicken, white rice, canned carrots, or green beans Salad with baked chicken, American cheese, smooth salad dressing, white dinner roll Baked potato (no skin) with sour cream and butter or margarine Hamburger with white seedless bun, ketchup, and mayonnaise -- and lettuce if it doesn't make your symptoms worse Dinner Tender roast beef, white rice, cooked carrots or spinach, white dinner roll with margarine or butter Pasta with butter or olive oil, French bread, fruit cocktail Baked chicken, white rice or baked potato without skin, and cooked green beans Broiled fish, white rice, and canned green beans Everyone is different. You may be OK with some of the things listed under ""foods to avoid,"" while other items on the ""foods to enjoy"" list may bother you. So keep a food diary for a few weeks. Track what you eat and how it makes you feel, so you know what works for you. If you enjoy whole grains, nuts, and raw fruits and vegetables, shifting to a low-residue diet may be hard. But if you prefer white bread and pasta, don't mind canned fruits and vegetables, and are happy to snack on saltines and vanilla wafers, it may come naturally. Remember, this isn't a healthy way to eat for a long time because it skips many important nutrients. Ask your doctor if he knows a nutritionist who can help make sure your diet is right for you and let you know if you need to take supplements."
219,"Because formula-fed babies are more likely to get ear infections, it is better to breast feed your infant for the first six to 12 months of life, if possible, to prevent ear infections. Remove as many environmental pollutants from your home as you can, including: Dust Cleaning fluid and solvents Tobacco smoke Also, reduce yours or your child's exposure to people with colds, and control allergies. Taking steps to prevent colds and flu as well as other illnesses can prevent some, but not all, ear infections. Here are some important steps to take: Be sure everyone in your household, including your children receive the proper vaccines when they are supposed to be given. That includes both flu and pneumococcal vaccines. Make hand washing a habit that becomes part of the family's normal routine. If possible, avoid group care for children, especially during cold and flu season."
220,"Most people who take medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) take a drug called a stimulant. Adderall and Ritalin are both in that category. They help control levels of two chemicals in your brain, dopamine and norepinephrine, that affect how well you concentrate. Studies show that stimulants work well on ADHD symptoms for about 80% of people who take them. About half of those people get the same results from either Adderall or Ritalin. But for the other half, one drug works better than the other. This is because they work in different ways and can cause different side effects. It usually takes some trial and error to find the drug and dosage that work best for you. If the first one you try doesn't help enough or causes too many side effects, your doctor can switch you to another one. Adderall is the brand name for a mix of two stimulants called amphetamine-dextroamphetamine. Ritalin is the brand name for a stimulant called methylphenidate. Both medications come in two forms, short-acting and long-acting. You take the long-acting form in the morning, and it's meant to last all day. The short-acting form lasts about 4 hours. Some long-acting forms are capsules that hold two kinds of beads: Half dissolve right away and give you one dose of the drug. The rest of the beads don't go into your system until later. The long-acting version of Adderall can last 10 to 12 hours, while the long-acting form of Ritalin lasts 6 to 12. The two drugs can cause some of the same side effects, like: Fast heartbeat Headaches Irritability Anxiety Loss of appetite Raised blood pressure Stomach upset Skin rash Trouble sleeping Weight loss Restlessness Tremors Tics Diarrhea Constipation Mood swings Hives Insomnia Nervousness Dizziness Belly pain or nausea They also come with warnings about the chance of heart problems, mental health problems, seizures, blurred vision, and circulation problems in your fingers and toes. With Adderall, men also may notice changes in their sex drives, impotence, frequent erections, or erections that last longer than usual. Some people who take it might have hair loss or rhabdomyolysis, a dangerous condition in which muscles break down. Prices can vary widely, so check with your insurance plan to see what's covered and compare prices at your local pharmacies. In general, the longer-acting forms of both Ritalin and Adderall are more expensive than the shorter-acting forms. And the generic versions can cost much less than brand names. The FDA classifies both medications as Schedule II controlled substances. That means it's possible for you to depend on them. But that may be less likely with the long-acting forms because they're designed to release their medicine slowly. If you've had a problem with drug or alcohol abuse in the past, talk to your doctor about whether you should take stimulant medications."
221,"When you have four or more migraines every month, your doctor may suggest you take a ""preventive"" medicine, instead of waiting to treat painful symptoms after they start. These drugs lower the chances that you'll have migraines in the first place. And when you do get one, it'll likely be briefer and less severe. Migraine affects everyone differently. Because of that, you may need to try more than one thing to find the treatment that's right for you. Your doctor will probably consider when and how often you get migraines and what other health problems you have. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) are fremanezumab ( Ajovy) specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. You give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device. In clinical trials, people consistently had one to two fewer migraine days a month than those who took placebo. Mild pain and redness at the injection site are the most common side effects. Some treatments for other health issues have been found to also stop migraines. For instance, beta-blockers, which doctors often prescribe to control blood pressure, can also slow down the brain cells linked to migraine. These include: Atenolol ( Tenormin) Metoprolol ( Lopressor, Toprol XL) Nadolol ( Corgard) Propranolol ( Inderal, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, Inno Pran) Timolol As many as 4 out of 5 of people who take beta-blockers get relief from their migraines. Still, like all drugs, they can cause side effects. These include feeling depressed and having problems during sex. You may not be able to take beta-blockers if you have asthma or diabetes. Your doctor may suggest a different type of preventive medicine if you have certain types of migraines with auras. These medicines were thought to increase stroke risk with this type of migraine, though the proof is very scant. Verapamil ( Calan, Covera, Verelan), which is often used to treat heart disease, may be a better choice for people who get auras. Calcium channel blockers are also often prescribed to treat cluster headaches. Unlike beta-blockers, you can take this medicine if you have asthma. Side effects can include constipation and low blood pressure. You don't need to be depressed to take them. They may be a good choice if you also have trouble sleeping. One type is known as ""tricyclic antidepressants,"" or TCAs, these medicines affect certain chemicals in your brain that can set the stage for a migraine attack. Amitriptyline ( Elavil) Nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor) Some people gain weight and feel very tired when they take these. TCAs can also cause severe problems if you have heart disease or are pregnant. Venlafaxine is a different type of antidepressant called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs). Experts say that is can also help prevent migraines. For kids and young adults, antidepressents could make depression worse and make suicide more likely. Tell your doctor right away. Long used to fill wrinkles, this nerve toxin has been found to stave off chronic migraines. It prevents a pain network in your brain from turning on. But it's only approved for people who have headaches at least 15 days each month. The more frequent your migraines, the better Botox seems to help. You may need several treatments before it starts to work. These drugs work by blocking pain signals in your brain. Divalproex sodium ( Depakote) Topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Trokendi XR, Topamax) Anti-seizure drugs could make you sleepy. You may also find it harder to focus. You shouldn't take them when you're pregnant. You should also avoid them if you have pancreatitis or a liver problem like hepatitis. If you're prone to migraines around your period, your doctor may have you take pain relief medicine like naproxen ( Anaprox, Naprosyn) or certain triptans, typically used to stop migraines once they've started, each month. You may be able to stave off an attack if you start a few days before your cycle starts, then stop a few days after your flow begins. Women who get auras with their menstrual migraines can take these instead of hormonal birth control, which comes with a greater chance of stroke for them. Doctors will often start with the beta-blocker propranolol, the antidepressant amitriptyline, or the anti-seizure medication topiramate. About half of people will have half the number of migraines once they're taking the right dose. For any of these drugs to work, you'll need to follow your doctor's instructions. In most cases, that will mean taking medicine regularly as prescribed by your doctor. It could be up to 3 months before you start to notice a difference. If you feel one drug isn't working, or comes with side effects that make you want to stop taking it, talk to your doctor. There may be a different treatment you could use that would be a better fit."
222,"Beginning at age 45, you should have routine screenings for colorectal cancer. There are several options for screening. Stool based tests include: Fecal immunochemical test ( FIT) yearly Guaiac fecal occult blood test yearly Stool DNA test every 3 years Structural examinations include: Colonoscopy every 10 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years. If you have a positive result on a screening test that is not a colonoscopy, further evaluation should be performed on a timely basis with a colonoscopy test to take a look at your entire colon. You may take medication to make you sleepy and relaxed before the procedure. If a doctor sees anything inside your colon or rectum that looks questionable, he'll take a biopsy to find out if it's cancerous. A biopsy is a routine type of test used to diagnose cancer and also to see whether an existing cancer has spread to the surrounding tissue. The doctor uses a special instrument to take out a small sample of tissue. The sample is sent to a lab to determine if there's any cancer. The screening and biopsy together take less than an hour. Sometimes doctors use a tiny needle to take a biopsy, and they may use a CT scan or ultrasound to guide them. A CT scan is a powerful X-ray that takes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. An ultrasound makes images using soundwaves. You'll go home the same day as your procedure. You can expect to feel some discomfort and have some light bleeding for a day or two. Serious complications are rare, but it is possible to get an infection or injury to your colon or rectum. Contact your doctor right away if you have: Fever or chills Heavy bleeding (greater than a teaspoon at a time) Severe pain Vomiting It may take a few days to get the results of your biopsy. If you do have cancer, the doctor will determine how aggressive it is and whether it started in your colon or spread there from somewhere else. You may need additional testing before you and your doctor can determine the best treatment plan."
223,"Primary biliary cholangiitis is a disease damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis. These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need. When bile ducts don't work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn't work the way it should. This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you'll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant. Doctors aren't totally sure. It isn't passed down from parents to children, but there does seem to be a family link. It's more common if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it. Most people who get it are women, and most are in their 40s and 50s. The disease may be linked to immune system problems like thyroid trouble, pernicious anemia, or scleroderma. Things from outside your body -- smoking, chemicals, or infections -- can also trigger the disease. Early on, you might not notice any at all. You can live for many years without problems. Later, you might feel tired or have itchy skin or dry eyes and mouth. As the disease gets worse, you might notice: Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Swollen feet and ankles Pain and swelling in your abdomen Bone, muscle, or joint pain Darkened skin If you have any of these symptoms, your doctor might suggest blood tests. They'll tell her how well your liver works and if you have any immune system issues. She may also want you to have imaging tests like an ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, or endoscopy ( ERCP). These provide a more detailed look at your liver and the area around it. She may also suggest a liver biopsy. She'll remove a small piece of liver tissue and examine it in the lab to look for damage or disease. There's no cure, but medications can slow down the disease. The most common drug is ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), which helps move bile through your liver. There are also newer drugs to treat symptoms like itching and fatigue. Your doctor may suggest you make some changes in your daily life. If you drink alcohol, stop. It puts a strain on your liver. Choose low-sodium foods and exercise regularly to ease your symptoms. When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option."
224,"A migraine is a powerful headache that often happens with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light. Migraines can last from 4 hours to 3 days, and sometimes longer. The American Migraine Foundation estimates that more than 36 million Americans get them, women 3 times more often than men. Most people start having migraine headaches between ages 10 and 40. But many women find that their migraines improve or disappear after age 50. They generally last between 4 and 72 hours. Migraine headaches are a symptom of an overall condition known as migraine. Doctors don't know the exact cause of migraine headaches, although they seem to be related to changes in the brain as well as to genes that run in families. You can even inherit the triggers that give you migraine headaches, like fatigue, bright lights, weather changes, and others. For many years, scientists believed migraines resulted from changes in blood flow in the brain. Many now think that they happen because of flaws in the brain passed down from your parents. A migraine starts when overactive nerve cells send out signals that activate the trigeminal nerve, the nerve that supplies sensation to your head and face. Activation of the nerve causes release of certain chemicals like serotonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP). CGRP causes blood vessels in the lining of the brain to swell. This releases neurotransmitters that create inflammation and pain. Some common migraine triggers include: Stress. When you're stressed, your brain releases chemicals that can cause the blood vessel changes that can lead to a migraine. Foods. Some foods and drinks, such as aged cheese, alcohol, and food additives like nitrates (in pepperoni, hot dogs, lunchmeats) and monosodium glutamate ( MSG) may be responsible for up to 30% of migraines. Caffeine. Getting too much or withdrawing from it can cause headaches when the level in your body abruptly drops. Blood vessels seem to get used to caffeine, and when you don't have any, you may get a headache. Caffeine itself can be a treatment for acute migraine attacks. Changes in weather. Storm fronts, changes in barometric pressure, strong winds, or changes in altitude can all trigger a migraine. Having your period Feeling very tired Skipping meals Changes to your sleep Yes, migraine headaches seem to run in families. Four out of 5 people with the condition have other family members who have them. If one parent has a history of these type of headaches, their child has a 50% chance of getting them, and if both parents have them, the risk jumps to 75%. You can have a mix of migraine symptoms. Common ones include: A headache that often begins as a dull ache and grows into throbbing pain. It usually gets worse during physical activity. The pain can shift from one side of the head to the other, can be in the front of the head, or feel like it's affecting your entire head. Sensitivity to light, noise, and smells Nausea and vomiting, upset stomach, and belly pain Loss of appetite Feeling very warm or cold Pale skin Fatigue Dizziness Blurred vision Diarrhea Fever (this is rare) Most migraine headaches last about 4 hours, but severe ones can go for more than 3 days. How often they happen differs for everyone, but it's common to get two to four headaches per month. Some people may get migraine headaches every few days, while others get them once or twice a year. The terms for two types of migraine headaches refer to the symptoms that signal when one is about to start, called an aura. Migraine with aura (known as ""classic"" migraine) Migraine without aura (known as ""common"" migraine) An aura can start 1 hour before the pain and usually last for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Visual auras include: Bright flashing dots or lights Blind spots Blurry vision Temporary vision loss Wavy or jagged lines Other auras can affect your other senses. You might just have a ""funny feeling"" and not be able to describe the sensation. You could also have ringing in the ears or changes in smell (such as strange odors), taste, or touch. Rare migraine conditions include these types of auras: Hemiplegic migraine. A short period of paralysis (hemiplegia) or weakness on one side of the body. You might also feel temporary numbness, dizziness, or vision changes. If you get these symptoms, it's important to know how to tell them apart from the signs of a stroke, which can seem similar. Get emergency medical help right away if you have these symptoms. Ophthalmic migraine. Short-lived, partial, or complete loss of vision in one eye, along with a dull ache behind the eye, which may spread to the rest of your head. Seek immediate medical help for any visual disturbance. Migraine with brainstem aura. Dizziness, confusion, or loss of balance can happen before the headache. The pain may affect the back of your head. These symptoms usually start suddenly and can happen with trouble speaking, ringing in the ears, and vomiting. This type of migraine is strongly linked to hormone changes and mainly affects young adult women. Again, these symptoms need to be checked out by a doctor right away. Status migrainosus. This rare and severe type of migraine can last more than 72 hours. The pain and nausea are so intense that you may need to go to the hospital. Sometimes medicines, or medication withdrawal, can cause them. Ophthalmoplegic migraine. Pain around the eye, including paralysis of the muscles around it. This is a medical emergency because the symptoms can also be caused by pressure on the nerves behind the eye or an aneurysm. Other symptoms of this rare type of migraine include a droopy eyelid, double vision, or other vision changes. Migraine headaches without auras are more common. Several hours before the headache starts, you can have vague symptoms, including: Anxiety Depression Feeling very tired There's no cure for migraine headaches. But many drugs can treat or even prevent some of them. You can also get them less often by avoiding triggers. Common types of migraine treatments include: Pain relief. Over-the-counter ( OTC) drugs often work well for some people. The main ingredients are acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine, and ibuprofen. Never give aspirin to anyone under the age of 19 because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. Be careful when you take OTC pain meds because sometimes they can add to a headache. If you use them too much, you can get rebound headaches or become dependent on them. If you take any OTC pain relievers more than two days a week, it's time to see your doctor. She can suggest prescription meds that may work better. Nausea medicine. Your doctor can prescribe it if you get nausea with your migraine. Preventive medicines. If you don't respond to other treatments and you have 4 or more migraine days a month, your doctor may suggest these. You take them regularly to reduce the severity or frequency of your headaches. They include seizure medicines, blood pressure medicines (like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers), and some antidepressants. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of preventive medicine that your doctor may recommend if others don't help. Biofeedback . This technique helps you recognize stressful situations that could trigger a migraine. If the headache begins slowly, biofeedback can stop the attack before it becomes full blown. Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS). You place this device on the back of your head at the start of a migraine with aura. It sends a pulse of magnetic energy to part of your brain, which may stop or reduce pain. Yes. You can have them less often when you identify and avoid migraine triggers. Keep track of your symptom patterns in a headache diary so you can figure out what's causing them. Stress management and relaxation training can help prevent your attacks or make them less severe. Women who often get migraine headaches around their periods can take preventive medicines when they know it's that time of the month. People also seem to have fewer migraine symptoms when they eat on a regular schedule and get enough rest. Regular exercise -- in moderation -- can also help prevent them. When lifestyle changes aren't enough, you have other options. Preventive migraine medications can make your headaches less severe and happen less often when you take them on a regular basis. Also, there are some new devices which can help. Cefaly is a portable, headband-like gadget sends electrical pulses through the skin of the forehead. It stimulates the trigeminal nerve, which is linked with migraine headaches. You use Cefaly once a day for 20 minutes, and when it's on you'll feel a tingling or massaging sensation. In addition, there is a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator called gamma Core. When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain."
225,"When your child has Down syndrome, one of the most useful things you can do is learn as much about it as you can. You might search online for programs and resources to help your child. Along the way, maybe you talk with other parents whose kids have Down syndrome so you can learn tips and find out what to expect. And, as your child grows, you can work with doctors, therapists, teachers, and other specialists. Beyond these big-picture tasks, it can also help to know what you can do day to day. Not only to support your child, but to take care of yourself, too. Every family has their joys, stresses, and challenges, but when you have a child with Down syndrome, things look a little different. Besides juggling school, music lessons, sports, and jobs, you typically have a lot of extra visits with doctors and therapists in the mix. That makes it even more important to accept help when it's offered and to pay attention to your own needs. Here are a few ideas: Build a support system. Invite your friends and family to take part in caregiving. They can let you have a little time to yourself to walk, read a book, or just zone out for a while. A break, even a small one, can help you be a better parent and partner. Talk about your challenges. People want to help, but don't always know how. A simple, â It's hard to get a healthy dinner on the table with all these appointments,â opens a door and gives them ideas of what they can do. Keep a list of things you need. And don't be afraid to use it. Next time someone says, â Just let me know how I can help,â you'll be ready. Find time for friends. Even if it's just a small moment after the kids go to bed, friends can help you laugh and recharge after a long week. Go easy on yourself. Everyone needs a break. You might also think about seeing a therapist. They can help you work through your feelings and give you tools to handle everyday stresses. Take care of your health. Exercise and eat well, even when you feel burnt out. Try to make a plan and stick to it as best you can. Like most children, kids with Down syndrome tend to do well with routine. They also respond better to positive support than discipline. Keep both of those things in mind as you try the following tips. Do all the run-of-the-mill kid things: Give your child chores around the house. Just break them up into small steps and be patient. Have your child play with other kids who do and don't have Down syndrome. Keep your expectations high as your child tries and learns new things. Make time to play, read, have fun, and go out together. Support your child in doing day-to-day tasks on his own. For everyday tasks: Create a daily routine and stick to it as best you can. For example, the morning might be âget up / eat breakfast / brush teeth / get dressed.â Help your child change from one activity to the next with very clear signals. For younger kids, seeing a picture or singing a song can help. Use pictures to make a daily schedule your child can see. To help your child with school, you might: Avoid saying â That's wrongâ to correct mistakes. Instead, say, â Try it again.â Offer help if it's needed. As you work with doctors, therapists, and teachers, focus on your child's needs rather than on the condition. Look at what your child is learning at school and see if you can work those lessons into your home life. When you talk to your child, keep it simple -- the fewer steps, the better. For example, try â Please put your pajamas on,â instead of â OK, it's time for bed. Let's get your teeth brushed, face washed, pajamas on, and pick out some books.â Have your child repeat directions back to you so you know you've been understood. Name and talk about things your child seems to get excited about. It's important for all kids to feel like they have some control over their lives. It's even more important for kids with Down syndrome, and it's one way to help them live a fulfilling life. For example, you can: Let your child make choices when it makes sense to. This can be as simple as letting him choose what clothes to wear. Allow him to take reasonable risks. This is a challenge every parent faces. You need to protect your children, but also let them see what they can handle. Support him in solving problems, like how to deal with an issue with friends or approach a problem at school. You don't have to fix it for them, but help them do it themselves."
226,"Sleep apnea treatments range from lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing sleep positions, to CPAP therapy, to surgery. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/basics/definition/con-20020286; Audio Jungle; Renars Jurkovskis; Stockbyte; Photo Talk; ukrainec; Brian Chase; Peter Cade; i Stock.

Changing sleep positions to improve breathing. Stopping smoking. Smoking can increase the swelling in the upper airway, which may worsen both snoring and apnea. Avoiding sleeping on your back. Continuous positive airway pressure -- also called CPAP -- is a treatment in which a mask is worn over the nose and/or mouth while you sleep. The mask is hooked up to a machine that delivers a continuous flow of air into the nose. This air flow helps keep the airways open so that breathing is regular. CPAP is the most common treatment for sleep apnea. There's also bi-level positive airway pressure, or BPAP, which is similar to CPAP but the air flow changes when you breathe in and then breathe out. Dental devices can be made that help keep the airway open during sleep. Such devices can be specifically designed by dentists with special expertise in treating sleep apnea. If you have a deviated nasal septum, enlarged tonsils, or a small lower jaw with an overbite causing the throat to be too narrow, surgery may be needed to correct sleep apnea. The most commonly performed types of surgery for sleep apnea include: Nasal surgery: Correction of nasal problems such as a deviated septum. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ( UPPP): A procedure that removes soft tissue on the back of the throat and palate, increasing the width of the airway at the opening of throat. Mandibular maxillomandibular advancement surgery: Surgery to correct certain facial problems or throat obstructions that contribute to sleep apnea. There are minimally invasive office procedures that reduce and stiffen the soft tissue of the soft palate. While these procedures have been effective in treating snoring, their effectiveness in treating sleep apnea in the long term isn't known. For people unable to use a CPAP, an implanted device called Inspire is now available. The device, called an upper airway stimulator, consists of a small pulse generator placed under the skin in the upper chest. A wire leading to the lung detects the person's natural breathing pattern. Another wire, leading up to the neck, delivers mild stimulation to nerves that control airway muscles, keeping them open. A doctor can program the device from an external remote. Also, those who have Inspire use a remote to turn it on before bed and turn off upon waking in the morning. The excess sleepiness that is often associated with sleep apnea can be treated with a medication. Soloriamfetol ( Sunosi) has proven effective in improving the patient's ability to stay awake."
227,"Seek emergency help if you have: Heavy vaginal bleeding Severe pain Frequent contractions 1. Monitor Bleeding Put on a sanitary pad or panty liner to keep track of the amount of bleeding. 2. Prevent Further Bleeding Don't insert anything into the vagina. Avoid sex, tampons, or douching while you're bleeding. 3. Get Help Call your health care provider immediately to find out if you should go the hospital or doctor's office. Tell the doctor or hospital staff if you have heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, cramping, fever, chills, or contractions, or if you feel lightheaded or faint. Put any tissue passed from the vagina into a clean container. Give it to your doctor for examination. A health care provider will examine you for signs of dangerous blood loss and may do tests to confirm the health of your pregnancy."
228,"Maybe you've felt exhausted or weak lately. Or your foot is starting to tingle. So you do a quick Internet search and come up with an alarming result: Your symptom is one of the signs of multiple sclerosis ( MS), a disease of the brain and spinal cord. Before you start to worry, know that many signs of the condition are the same as symptoms of other health problems. So it's easy to mistake another issue for MS, which affects less than 1% of Americans. How can you tell if what you're feeling is caused by MS or something else? First, keep in mind that most people have the first signs of the disease between the ages of 20 and 40. You can also keep track of your problems: MS symptoms tend to come and go or get worse over time. It helps to know what else can explain some of the signs you might be feeling. A lack of feeling or a pins-and-needles sensation can be the first sign of the nerve damage from MS. It usually happens in the face, arms, or legs, and on one side of the body. It also tends to go away on its own. Numbness and tingling can also come from a lack of blood flow or a pinched nerve, so think first if you slept in a funny position or sat without moving for a long time. Other conditions can lead to nerve damage, too: Carpal tunnel syndrome affects the wrist, while diabetic neuropathy can trigger numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet or hands. Sudden numbness on one side of the body may signal a stroke. If that happens to you, call 911 ASAP. Learn more about causes of numbness and tingling in your limbs. Is the room spinning? MS can make you feel lightheaded or off-balance, usually when you're standing up and moving around. If you're dizzy and nauseous when you're lying down, or if you stumble to one side, chances are it's a problem with your inner ear, which controls your balance. Medications, such as those for depression and seizure disorders, can cause similar problems, too. Did a quick wave of lightheadedness hit? That's often a sign of low blood sugar, dehydration, or a sudden drop in blood pressure you get when you stand up quickly. You may need to slowly rise instead of hopping to your feet. Learn more about the causes of dizziness. About 80% of people with MS feel very tired, making it one of the most common symptoms. But a number of things can make you feel exhausted, including a sleep disorder, depression, or too little iron in your blood. MS fatigue tends to be worse than run-of-the-mill sluggishness. You may not have the energy to do even simple things, like cook dinner or take the dog for a walk. Other signs include: You feel wiped out every day. You're tired in the morning, even after a good night's sleep, and it gets worse as the day goes on. You feel fatigued easily and suddenly. It gets worse in heat and humidity. Don't have these signs? To ease your fatigue, make sure you get enough sleep, exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, and keep your stress in check. Talk to your doctor if you just can't seem to feel rested. Learn more about what causes extreme fatigue. Lifting that 10-pound dumbbell was part of your usual workout routine, but now it feels impossible. What gives? Sudden weakness, especially in an arm or leg, is a MS symptom. If you feel weak all over, odds are there's another problem at play. You may be fighting off a cold or the flu. Or you may have too few red blood cells in your body, a condition called anemia. Weakness on just one side of the body can be from something mild like a pinched nerve or a serious problem like a stroke. If it happens along with other symptoms, like a drooping face or slurred speech, call 911 right away. Learn about conditions that look like a stroke. You're reading a book and suddenly you see two of the same line or the page becomes a gray jumble. Vision problems caused by MS usually come on suddenly. They include: Blurry, gray, or double vision Blindness or a dark spot in one eye Eye movements you can't control If your sight is slowly getting worse, there's most likely another issue to blame. Some blurriness is a normal part of aging -- you may just need a new pair of glasses. A more serious issue, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy, can also lead to vision problems like blind spots. To rule out these diseases, have a checkup with your eye doctor. Learn more about symptoms of common vision problems. â What did you say?â People with MS might hear this phrase a lot -- the disease can damage the part of your brain that controls speech. Here are the main symptoms: Slurred words Nasal speech, or sounding like you have a cold Long pauses between words or syllables, called scanning speech If you drink too much alcohol, your speech might be slurred for a little while. But if the problem comes out of nowhere, call for help right away. It could be a sign of a brain injury or stroke. Learn more about causes of sudden speech problems. About 55% of people with MS say they have pain at one point or another, while 48% have long-lasting pain. There are a few different types they might have, such as: Throbbing pain in the face Brief, intense pain that runs from the back of the head to the spine Burning or aching across the body, which is also called the â MS hugâ Aches caused by stiffness or muscle spasms Pain can happen for many reasons. If you hurt, talk to your doctor about where and when it happens. He can help you know if the cause is MS or another problem. Learn more about types of pain and their causes. If you have sudden numbness on one side of your body or trouble seeing or speaking, get medical help right away. These are signs of a life-threatening stroke. If your symptoms are out of the ordinary for you and last for more than a day, make an appointment to see your doctor. She can talk to you about what you're feeling and do some tests to see if your issues are because of MS or another health problem."
229,"Your bowels are made up of two parts -- the large intestine, also called the colon, and the small intestine. Short bowel syndrome usually affects people who've had a lot of their small intestine removed. Without this part, your body can't get enough nutrients and water from the food you eat. This causes bowel troubles, like diarrhea, which can be dangerous if you go without treatment. If you learn you have short bowel syndrome, know that doctors can do a lot of things to ease your symptoms and make sure you get the right nutrition. People who have the disease can lead active lives. Over time, your body may adjust to having a shorter small intestine, and you may be able to take fewer medicines. The key is to stick to your treatment plan and get the support you need. Adults usually have about 20 feet of small intestine. Those with short bowel syndrome usually have at least half of their small intestine missing or removed. There are a lot of reasons why this might happen. Some babies are born with bowel problems that damage parts of the intestine. Others are just born with shorter bowels. Most often, short bowel syndrome happens after surgery to remove a large part of the small intestine. Doctors may remove the small intestine as part of a treatment for: Crohn's disease, a lifelong inflammatory bowel disease that causes belly pain, diarrhea, and other digestive problems Cancer Damage from cancer treatment, like radiation therapy Bowel injury The main symptom of short bowel syndrome is diarrhea that doesn't go away. You or your child may also have: Cramping Bloating Gas Heartburn Weakness Fatigue Weight loss Since your body has trouble getting nutrients and vitamins from food, it can also cause: Anemia (not enough red blood cells) Easy bruising Fatty liver Gallstones Kidney stones Bone pain and osteoporosis (thinning and fragile bones) Trouble eating certain foods If you're having any symptoms and you've had a lot of your small intestine removed, your doctor may already suspect short bowel syndrome. To be sure, he'll do a physical exam and may run other tests, including: Blood tests Stool exam X-rays of your chest and belly Upper GI series, also called a barium X-ray. You'll drink a special liquid that coats your throat, stomach, and small intestine to make them stand out on the X-ray image. CT scan, a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make images of your organs Bone density test Liver biopsy, when doctors remove a piece of tissue for testing. Most of the time, doctors make a small cut on your belly and use a hollow needle to get the cells they need. They use a CT scan or an ultrasound to see where to place the needle. The biopsy takes about 5 minutes, but you may need a few hours to recover. Along with the tests, your doctor will probably also ask you questions about your symptoms, like: How are you feeling? When did your symptoms begin? Do you have any other medical conditions? How are your energy levels? Are you having any diarrhea? Do you have problems after you eat certain foods? What makes your symptoms better? What makes them worse? How serious is my short bowel syndrome? Will it ever go away? What can I do to feel better? What kinds of treatment do I need? How will we know if they work? What kinds of food should I eat? If your child has short bowel syndrome, ask your doctor how you can make sure he's getting the nutrition he needs to grow. Treatment has two goals: to ease symptoms and give you enough vitamins and minerals. The kind of treatment you get depends on how severe your condition is. For mild cases, you may need to have several small meals a day, along with extra fluids, vitamins, and minerals. Your doctor will probably also give you medicine for diarrhea. Treatment is the same for moderate cases, but from time to time, you may need extra fluids and minerals through an IV. For more serious cases, you may get an IV feeding tube instead of eating meals. Or, you may have a tube placed directly into your stomach or small intestine. If your condition improves enough, you can stop the tube feedings. In the most severe cases, people need IV feeding tubes all the time. Your doctor may suggest surgery, including a transplant of part or all of your small intestine. A new organ can cure small bowel syndrome, but a transplant is major surgery. Doctors usually recommend it only when other treatments haven't worked. If you choose this option, your doctor will put you on a waiting list for a small intestine from a donor. After your transplant, you could be in the hospital for 6 weeks or longer. You'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting your new organ. You'll need the medicine and regular check-ups for the rest of your life. Depending on your condition, there are other treatments that may help your small intestine absorb more nutrients and water. They include: Teduglutide ( Gattex). Doctors may prescribe this hormone for adults with more serious cases of short bowel syndrome who need IV feeding tubes. L-glutamine, a powder that you can mix with water and drink. It may help your small intestine absorb more nutrients, some studies have shown. Somatropin ( Zorbtive), a human growth hormone. You get this medicine in a shot. It may help your intestines work better on their own, so you won't need as much nutritional support. It's very important to make sure children with short bowel syndrome get enough calories and nutrients, since they are still growing. Talk to a doctor or a dietitian about what kinds of food are best. Your child's doctor will check him regularly to make sure he's getting what he needs. Some people may need treatment for only a short time. They get what doctors call intestinal adaptation, when the small intestine is able to adjust to its shorter length and work as it should. It can take up to 2 years for that to happen, and most people still need treatment before their organ gets used to things. Scientists are looking for new treatments for short bowel syndrome in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. It's hard to deal with symptoms like diarrhea, but short bowel syndrome doesn't have to take over your life. It's important that you keep in touch with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you can keep things in control. You can also take steps to feel better, like: Know what to eat. There's no single diet plan for people with short bowel syndrome, but in general, you should make sure to eat lean protein (meat, dairy products, eggs, tofu) and carbs that are low in fiber (white rice, pasta, white bread). Avoid sweets and fat. A dietitian can help you figure out what foods are best. Stay active. Exercise is good for your body and mind. Your doctor can tell you how much and what kinds of activity are right for you. If you're using an IV for treatment, ask for one that you can carry with you. Ask for help. Family, friends, and members of your community can help you run errands, get rides to the doctor, or just let you vent about the stresses of treatment. It may help to talk to a psychologist or counselor, too. Learn from others. Support groups can be a great way to get advice and understanding from other people living with short bowel syndrome. Find a group that meets in your area, or explore online discussion boards. By working closely with your doctor, you can keep your symptoms under control and lead an active life. Short bowel syndrome can be very serious if you don't follow your treatment plan. You can become dehydrated, and there's a chance your body won't get enough nutrients. For some people, the condition gets better, and they don't need a lot of treatment after a while. Whether your short bowel syndrome goes away depends on your age, how healthy you are, how much of your small and large intestines remain, and whether you have another condition like Crohn's disease. For more information on Short Bowel Syndrome, visit the web site of The Short Bowel Syndrome Foundation. You can find out about support groups there, too."
230,"Do your eyes water on windy days? Are you always stuffy when it rains? That's no surprise. Weather is a common allergy trigger. The connection between your symptoms and the weather depends on what you're allergic to. Here are a few common triggers: Dry, windy days. Wind blows pollen into the air, causing hay fever. If you have pollen allergies, shut the windows and stay indoors on windy days. Rainy or humid days. Moisture makes mold grow, both indoors and out. Dust mites also thrive in humid air. But if you're allergic to pollen, humid or damp days are good. The moisture weighs down the pollen, keeping it on the ground. Cold air. Many people with allergic asthma find that cold air is a problem, especially when they exercise outside. It can trigger a coughing fit. Heat. Air pollution is worst on hot summer days. Ozone and smog can be a serious trigger for people with allergic asthma. The change of seasons also has a big effect on allergies. Spring. In cooler states, plants start to release pollens in February or March. Tree pollens are also a common spring allergy cause. Summer. Early in summer, grass pollen can trigger reactions. Later in the summer, ragweed and other weeds can become a problem. Mold can hit its peak in July in the warmer states. Fall. Ragweed season usually ends with the first frost in October. In colder states, mold tends to be worst in the fall. Winter. Indoor allergens -- like pet dander and dust mites -- can become more of a problem in winter. Why? When it's cold out, you spend more time indoors. Unless you're prepared to settle down in a bunker, there's no way to avoid the weather. But you can work around it and reduce your allergy symptoms. Pay attention to the weather. Check local pollen and mold counts. Watch for Ozone Action Days. Spend less time outside when you're likely to have problems. Prepare for allergies. If you have the same allergy at the same time every year -- ragweed in the fall or tree pollen in the spring -- get ahead of it. Ask your doctor if you can start taking allergy drugs about 2 weeks before you usually start sneezing, coughing, or itching. That way, you can stop them before they start. Control your environment. You can't change what's happening outside, but you do have some control over conditions in your house. Use air conditioning to filter out mold and pollen. Use a dehumidifier to ward off mold growth and dust mites. Get the right diagnosis. Don't just guess what's causing your allergies. See your doctor to have an allergy skin test, which can show you exactly what triggers your symptoms. When you get the results, you might consider asking about immunotherapy, such as allergy shots or tablets that go under your tongue. They can help keep your allergies under control no matter what the weather or the season."
231,"Borderline personality and bipolar: These two disorders are often confused. They both have symptoms of impulsiveness and mood swings. But they are different disorders and have different treatments. Also known as manic depression, bipolar disorder causes swings in mood, energy, and the ability to function throughout the day. Symptoms: Bipolar disorder is known for alternating periods of depression and mania that can last from days to months. During a manic, hypomanic, or depressed episode with ""mixed features,"" symptoms of depression and mania happen at the same time. Unlike borderline personality disorder, the mood swings of bipolar disorder are not triggered by interpersonal conflicts, last for days to weeks rather than minutes to hours, and episodes are, by definition, accompanied by changes in sleep, energy, speech, and thinking During times of mania, symptoms might include: An excessively happy or angry, irritated mood More physical and mental energy and activity than normal Racing thoughts and ideas Talking more and faster Making big plans Risk taking Impulsiveness (substance abuse, sex, spending, etc.) Less sleep, but no feeling of being tired During periods of depression, symptoms might include: Drop in energy Lasting sadness Less activity and energy Restlessness and irritability Problems concentrating and making decisions Worry and anxiety No interest in favorite activities Feelings of guilt and hopelessness; suicidal thoughts Change in appetite or sleep patterns Treatment: Most people with bipolar disorder need lifelong treatment to keep their condition managed. This usually includes medicine -- usually mood stabilizers, and sometimes also antipsychotics or antidepressants. Therapy can also help people with bipolar disorder understand it and develop skills to handle it. Borderline personality disorder involves a longstanding pattern of abrupt, moment-to-moment swings -- in moods, relationships, self-image, and behavior (in contrast to distinct episodes of mania or depression in people with bipolar disorder) that are usually triggered by conflicts in interactions with other people. People with borderline personality disorder can experience overly strong emotional responses to upsetting life events and often try to hurt themselves. They often have chaotic relationships with people. People with borderline personality disorder are more likely to have other mental health problems, too. They are also more likely to have had some type of trauma as a child than people with bipolar disorder, although trauma in itself does not cause borderline personality disorder. They often also can have problems with addictions, eating disorders, body image, and anxiety. Symptoms: A person with borderline personality disorder has trouble controlling his thoughts and managing his feelings, and often has impulsive and reckless behavior. Here are the condition's main symptoms: Frantic efforts to avoid feeling abandoned History of unstable, intense relationships Tendency to view people and situations as either ""all good"" or ""all bad"" Poor self-image Impulsiveness (spending, sex, substance abuse, etc.) Self-harm (e.g., cutting) or suicidal behavior Mood swings involving anger and depression, usually in response to stressful events or relationships Feelings of emptiness Problems managing anger and unpleasant emotions Paranoia Treatment: Long-term treatment is usually necessary for people with borderline personality disorder. Treatment mainly involves specific forms of psychotherapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT) or transference-focused psychotherapy ( TFP) aimed at helping people manage impulses (such as suicidal urges or tendencies to self-harm when they feel upset), feelings of distress or anger, and emotional oversensitivities to interactions with other people. Medications are also sometimes used to help with these symptoms, although they are not always effective and not considered to be the main focus of treatment in borderline personality disorder. Sometimes, short hospital stays are also needed to manage times of crisis that involve threats to safety and well-being."
232,"If you're told you have a mycoplasma infection, you'll need to dig a little deeper and find out what type you've got. There are five major kinds, and each one can affect you in a different way. All mycoplasma infections have one thing in common, though. They're caused by tiny living things called bacteria. Unlike other bacteria, the ones that lead to mycoplasma infections don't have cell walls. That's important because many antibiotics kill bacteria by weakening those walls. Since mycoplasma bacteria don't have them, some antibiotics, like penicillin, won't work against them. There are about 200 types of mycoplasma bacteria, but most of them are harmless. The ones you may have to worry about are: Mycoplasma pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma hominis Ureaplasma urealyticum Ureaplasma parvum This type causes lung infections. About a third of people who get infected come down with a mild form of pneumonia called ""walking pneumonia."" Most people, especially children, will get ""tracheobronchitis,"" a fancy name for a chest cold. You can catch one of these infections when someone who is sick coughs or sneezes and sends droplets with the bacteria into the air. If you're infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, you may get symptoms like: Sore throat Cough Fever Fatigue Headache To treat your infection, your doctor may suggest one of these types of antibiotics: Fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin or erythromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline You get this if you have sex with someone who's infected. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you're a woman, you may notice that you: Have pain during sex Bleed from the vagina after sex Get a discharge from the vagina If you're a man, the infection can cause: Urethritis -- a swelling of the urethra, the tube that urine goes through as it leaves the body Stinging or burning when you pee Discharge from the penis To find out if you're infected, your doctor may do a test called NAAT to look for the bacteria's genes. He will ask for a urine sample or take a swab from the vagina, cervix, or urethra. For treatment, you may need to take one of these types of antibiotics: Fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline Your partner may need to get treated, too. There's a little bit of trial and error when you take these meds, because sometimes the bacteria don't respond to them. If the first drug doesn't work, your doctor can prescribe a different one. You can help prevent Mycoplasma genitalium if you use a condom during sex. These bacteria live in the urinary tract and genitals of about half of all women and fewer men. But if you're in general good health, you don't have to worry. They rarely cause an infection. Women with a weakened immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- are most at risk. You can sometimes pick up this infection during sex. The bacteria can also pass from a mother to her baby during childbirth. If you're a woman, these bacteria may be linked to pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of your reproductive organs. They can also lead to problems if you're pregnant, such as: Ectopic pregnancy (the embryo grows outside the uterus) Early delivery Miscarriage Mycoplasma hominis can also cause a fever and infection in your newborn baby. To find out if you have an infection caused by this type of bacteria, your doctor will test a sample of fluid from your vagina or urethra. If you do, you'll get treated with antibiotics such as one in the tetracycline family, like doxycycline. To help keep this infection away, always use a condom during sex. And limit how many partners you have. Most healthy women have these bacteria in their cervix or vagina, and a smaller number of men also have them in their urethra. Normally, they don't cause any problems. Ureaplasma can spread during sex. If you're pregnant and you're infected, you can pass the bacteria to your baby in the womb or during childbirth. Some symptoms women can get are: It hurts when you pee Belly pain Pain, odor, or discharge from the vagina Swelling at the opening of the urethra Discharge from the urethra Men who are infected can get inflammation of the urethra, called urethritis. During pregnancy, the bacteria can lead to infections in both the mother and the baby. Problems in newborn babies can include: Low birth weight Pneumonia Bacteria in the blood, called septicemia To diagnose a ureaplasma infection, your doctor can take a sample of fluid from: Blood Amniotic fluid Placental tissue Cervix Urethra Your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection. Choices may include: Fluoroquinolones like moxifloxacin Macrolides such as azithromycin Tetracyclines like doxycycline If you were infected while pregnant, your newborn baby may also need to get antibiotics."
233,"Chemical pneumonia is an unusual type of lung irritation. Pneumonia usually is caused by a bacteria or virus. In chemical pneumonia, inflammation of lung tissue is from poisons or toxins. Only a small percentage of pneumonias are caused by chemicals. Many substances can cause chemical pneumonia, including liquids, gases, and small particles, such as dust or fumes, also called particulate matter. Some chemicals only harm the lungs; however, some toxic materials affect other organs in addition to the lungs and can result in serious organ damage or death. Chemical pneumonia can be caused by aspiration. Aspiration means that you breathe oral secretions or stomach contents into your lungs. The inflammation comes from the toxic effects of stomach acid and enzymes on lung tissue. Bacteria from the stomach or mouth can also cause a bacterial pneumonia. Chemical pneumonia is only one type of lung inflammation. You can read about viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia in their own sections. Signs and symptoms of chemical pneumonia vary greatly, and many factors can determine its seriousness. For instance, someone exposed to chlorine in a large outdoor pool may have only a cough and burning eyes. Someone else exposed to high levels of chlorine in a small room may die of respiratory failure. Factors that determine the severity of symptoms include the following: Type and strength of chemical Exposure environment -- Indoors, outdoors, hot, cold Length of exposure -- Seconds, minutes, hours Form of chemical -- Gas, vapor, particulate, liquid Protective measures used Prior medical condition Your age Chemical pneumonia may have the following signs and symptoms: Symptoms Burning of the nose, eyes, lips, mouth, and throat Dry cough Wet cough producing clear, yellow, or green mucus Cough producing blood or frothy pink matter in the saliva Nausea or abdominal pain Chest pain Shortness of breath Painful breathing or pleuritis (an inflammation of the outside covering of the lungs) Headache Flu-like symptoms Weakness or a general ill feeling Delirium or disorientation Signs a doctor might observe Rapid or shallow breaths Rapid pulse Oral, nasal, or skin burns Pale skin and lips Sweating Altered thinking and reasoning skills Unconsciousness Swelling of eyes or tongue Hoarse or muffled voice Chemical odors on other areas of the body Frothy spit from a cough Fever Should any symptoms of chemical pneumonia occur, call your doctor or the local poison control center. Any person with serious signs or symptoms should be transported immediately by ambulance to the nearest hospital's emergency department. Chemical identification is helpful both for the poison control center and the doctor. This should not take precedence over medical care, however, especially for those with severe signs or symptoms. Immediate evaluation in a hospital's emergency department is necessary for treating the following conditions: Unconsciousness Cyanosis -- A blue discoloration of the mouth or skin Difficulty breathing Sudden change of voice Mouth or throat swelling Chest pain Shortness of breath Cough productive of frothy or bloody spit Altered thinking and reasoning skills Exposure to potentially deadly chemical Vomiting and aspiration The poison control center may suggest other conditions particular to the chemical that would need emergency care. Diagnosis and treatment for chemical pneumonia will vary depending on signs and symptoms. Frequently, the symptoms will be mild, the chemical will be well known, and the medical evaluation brief and focused. Sometimes serious signs and symptoms will need life-saving procedures, such as artificial ventilation, advanced cardiac life support, or complex medical therapy. In most cases, the doctor will consult local poison control experts for advice. The doctor must first make sure that hospital staff are not at risk for exposure themselves. The next priority is to identify the chemical and consider the effects this chemical has on the lungs and the rest of the body. A thorough history will be obtained to include the length of exposure, area of exposure, form and concentration of the chemical, other medical problems, and symptoms. In addition to close inspection of the vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and how much oxygen you have in your blood), the doctor will evaluate, at a minimum, the eyes, nose, throat, skin, heart, lungs, and abdomen. Once these steps have been taken, further evaluation may vary depending on the status of the person injured, the type of chemical exposure, and other factors. Self- Care at Home Your decision to seek medical care depends on the severity of symptoms and other factors of exposure. If you accidentally inhale a chemical, you probably want some medical advice. You can call your local poison control center for help. If your symptoms are serious, you will want immediate treatment at a hospital. Home care may be the most important aspect of medical management. Quickly get away from the offending chemical or area of exposure. If possible, avoid exposing others to the same chemical. Once you're away from the area, consider further decontamination, such as removing your clothes and showering. Alert the appropriate authorities to avoid further problems. Identify and contain the chemical. Medical evaluation may involve local police, fire department, emergency medical services ( EMS), and hazardous materials personnel. Evaluation and treatment vary. Almost everyone will have measurements of blood pressure, oxygen level, heart rate, and respiratory rate. In many people with chemical pneumonia, treatment is mostly observation. Sometimes symptoms develop over time and the amount of damage done won't be totally known for several hours. Many treatments are possible, including the following: IV fluids Oxygen by mask or tube Breathing treatment with medicine to open breathing tubes Steroid medications by IV or mouth Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by mouth Pain medications by IV or mouth Artificial ventilation (help breathing) Preventive antibiotics (sometimes) Prognosis depends on the chemical exposure and person's medical condition. For example, an elderly person with lung disease exposed to moderate amounts of vaporized ammonium chloride might suffer serious problems as compared to a young athlete with no lung problems. In general, the more severe the symptoms, the more likely you will suffer short- and long-term complications. Short-term complications include other organ injury in addition to possible death. Long-term complications include lung scarring and recurrent pneumonia."
234,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } In a typical sleep cycle, we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep. For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated. The cause of narcolepsy is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes strongly associated with the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain. In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep. These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances. Symptoms of narcolepsy include: Excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. People with EDS report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood, and/or extreme exhaustion. Cataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger. Hallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening. Sleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak. A physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram ( PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test ( MSLT). The PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition. The MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart. Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder ( EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine-like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs. There has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called sodium oxybate ( Xyrem, helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. . In addition, the new drug solriamfetol ( Sunosi) has been approved to help those with narcolepsy stay awake for longer periods of time. Patients with narcolepsy can be substantially helped -- but not cured -- by medical treatment. Lifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms."
235,"There are no guarantees when it comes to cancer recovery. But doctors have greater success finding and treating some types of the disease than others. Some are slowly starting to use another "" C"" word for cancer: ""cure."" Some experts don't use that word, noting that you can never be sure that cancer will go away for good after treatment. They prefer to say ""remission,"" meaning there's a chance the disease can return. But in general, a person who stays cancer-free 5 years after a diagnosis has better odds of recovery. That benchmark doesn't mean you can't die from cancer or even that you don't still have it in your body, but it is a good sign. Here are five cancers where there's stronger hope for recovery. People alive 5 years after diagnosis: About 99% What makes the chances of recovery good? Many prostate tumors grow slowly or not at all. When that happens, they aren't harmful enough to need treatment. Many men with these types of tumors can live for years without problems. They often die of something other than their cancer. When is a cure less likely? When cancer spreads (called metastatic cancer), it's much harder to treat. A small percentage of prostate cancers can move quickly to distant parts of the body. When that happens, only about 29% of men live 5 years after they're diagnosed. The good news is that doctors usually catch most prostate cancers early before they spread. Does screening help? There are two main ways to check for prostate cancer. One is the digital rectal exam, when your doctor checks inside your bottom with a gloved finger. The second is a blood test called the PSA test, which measures levels of a protein that's often higher in men with prostate cancer. PSA can go up for reasons other than prostate cancer, so some medical groups say men who have a normal risk for the disease shouldn't get the test. Talk with your doctor about whether you need testing. Always let him know if you notice any problems like trouble peeing or blood in your pee. These could be symptoms of cancer or other prostate problems. People alive 5 years after diagnosis: about 98% (depending on tissue type) What makes the chances of recovery good? The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck that makes hormones your body needs to burn calories, control your heartbeat, and more. The most common type of thyroid cancer, papillary, grows slowly. Even when tumors are large or start to grow into other nearby tissues, doctors often can treat and even cure this disease with surgery that removes the gland. After surgery, people take medicine to replace the hormones the thyroid makes. Doctors also are finding thyroid cancers earlier than ever before, which makes them easier to get rid of. When is a cure less likely? A type of the disease called anaplastic thyroid cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 7%, but it's very rare. Does screening help? There are no recommended screening tests for thyroid cancer. Most people find out they have a tumor when they (or a doctor) feel lumps or swelling in their neck. Sometimes a doctor spots the problem when you get an ultrasound for another reason. Definitely tell your doctor if you feel a lump in your neck or if you have any symptoms such as trouble breathing or swallowing. People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: 95.1% What makes the chances of recovery good? In its early stages (when the tumor hasn't spread to other body parts), doctors can cure this cancer with surgery to remove one or both testicles that have a tumor. If a man has only one testicle removed (which is the norm), the other will usually make enough hormones for him to have sex and father children. For later-stage cancers, surgery and radiation or chemotherapy often work well. Stem cell transplant is sometimes performed. Doctors credit the chemo drug cisplatin, introduced in the 1970s, with major boosts in survival rates for advanced testicular cancer. When is a cure less likely? There are treatments that work well even for advanced testicular cancer. The 5-year survival rate for this type of tumor is 73%, still pretty high for a cancer in the late stages. Does screening help? There are no screening tests for testicular cancer. Men should see their doctor if they feel a lump in a testicle, or if one becomes larger than the other. These could be early signs of a tumor. People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: 91.7% What makes the chances of recovery good? You can usually spot melanoma skin cancer with the naked eye while it is still in its early stages. If it hasn't spread beyond the surface of the skin, doctors can remove and cure it with surgery. When is a cure less likely? If you don't catch it early, melanoma is much more likely than other skin cancers to spread to other body parts. Once it goes beyond the skin's surface, it's hard to treat. Only 15%-20% of people who find melanomas after they've spread to other body parts will still be alive 5 years after their diagnosis. Does screening help? Yes. You can check your skin for large, dark, oddly shaped, or raised blotches. It's especially important to check your back and your scalp, scrotum, and in between your toes. It's harder to see melanomas in these places. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any of these changes. He can tell you if the spot is normal or not. Get screened regularly by a dermatologist if you have a higher risk for melanoma, like if you've had it before or it runs in your family. People alive 5 years after a diagnosis: early stages of 0 and 1 - 99% to 100% What makes the chances of recovery good? Modern medicine has made great strides against breast cancer. Doctors today know more about how to find and treat it. We also understand the condition much better than ever before. For instance, we now know that breast cancer is not one disease but many. Researchers have come up with different medications to treat specific types. When is a cure less likely? Breast cancer caught early is easier to treat and cure than after it starts to spread. Some types of the disease are also more treatable than others. For example, a breast tumor that is ""estrogen receptor positive"" will benefit from drugs that lower estrogen levels. On the other hand, ""triple negative"" breast cancers tend to be more aggressive and don't benefit from targeted treatments. Does screening help? Yes. Studies have found that regular mammograms can help you live longer. But medical groups have different guidelines on when you should get them. Some recommend screening tests every other year starting at age 50 if you have a normal risk for breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends women starting at age 45 get yearly mammograms and those ages 40 â 44 should have the choice to begin yearly mammograms if they would like."
236,"To determine the cause of your wheezing, your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and what triggers them. For example, if you have no history of lung disease and you always wheeze after eating a certain food or at a certain time of year, the doctor may suspect that you have a food or respiratory allergy. The doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear where the wheezing is and how much wheezing you have. If this is the first time you've been evaluated, your doctor will probably ask you to perform a breathing test (spirometry) and may also order a chest X-ray. Other blood tests and procedures may be necessary, depending on what the doctor learns from interviewing and examining you. If it seems like allergies may be related to your wheezing, there are a variety of other tests your doctor may use to verify allergies, including skin testing or blood tests. First off, see a doctor to determine the cause of your wheezing and then receive treatment for the specific cause. If wheezing is caused by asthma, your doctor may recommend some or all of the following to reduce inflammation and open the airways: A fast-acting bronchodilator inhaler -- albuterol ( Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol ( Xopenex) -- to dilate constricted airways when you have respiratory symptoms An inhaled corticosteroid -- beclomethasone ( Qvar), budesonide ( Pulmicort), ciclesonide ( Alvesco), flunisolide ( Aerospan), fluticasone ( Flovent), mometasone ( Asmanex) A long-acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination -- budesonide/formoterol ( Symbicort), fluticasone/salmeterol ( Advair) A long-acting anticholinergic -- tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva Respimat). This drug is used in addition to a regular maintenance medication for better symptom control, and is available for use by anyone age 6 years and older. An asthma controller pill to reduce airway inflammation -- montelukast ( Singulair), zafirlukast ( Accolate) A non-sedating antihistamine pill -- cetirizine ( Zyrtec), fexofenadine ( Allegra), loratadine ( Claritin, Alavert) -- or a prescription nasal spray -- budesonide ( Rhinocort), fluticasone propionate ( Flonase), mometasone furoate ( Nasonex), triamcinolone acetonide ( Nasacort AQ) -- if you have nasal allergies. Flonase, Nasacort Allergy 24 HR and Rhinocort Allergy are also available over the counter. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend some or all of the following: A bronchodilator -- albuterol ( Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol, ( Xopenex) -- to help ease the wheezing as the infection clears. An antibiotic is usually not needed unless you have an underlying chronic lung problem or your doctor suspects a bacterial infection may be present. Generally, any mild wheezing that accompanies acute bronchitis disappears when the infection does. Call 911 if you have any difficulty breathing. In emergencies, a medical team may administer any of the following: A shot of epinephrine to open clogged respiratory passages Oxygen A corticosteroid (such as methylprednisolone or prednisone) Frequent or continuous nebulizer (breathing) treatments A mechanical ventilator to help you breathe"
237,"Some standard and simple things give your doctor his first clues on how well your heart works. During your visit, your doctor will: Listen to your heart Take your heart rate Check your blood pressure He'll look at your appearance while you sit, perform mild activity, and lie flat. People with mild or moderate heart failure may appear comfortable at rest, but when active, they often become short of breath. Folks with heart failure may become uncomfortable if they lie flat for a few minutes. Your doctor feels your pulse to check your heart's rate, rhythm, and regularity. Each pulse matches with a heartbeat that pumps blood into your arteries. The force of the pulse also helps to tell him the amount of blood flow to different areas of your body. You can find out how fast your heart is beating by feeling your pulse. Your heart rate is the amount of times your heart beats in one minute. To measure your pulse, all you need is a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers. Count the number of taps you feel in 10 seconds, then multiply that number by six to find out your heart rate for 1 minute (pulse in 10 seconds x 6 = number of beats per minute). When feeling your pulse, you can also tell if your heart rhythm is regular or not. Your doctor listens to your heart with a stethoscope. The opening and closing of your valves make a ""lub dub"" sound known as heart sounds. The doctor can evaluate your heart and its valves and hear your heart's rate and rhythm by listening to your heart sounds. Blood pressure is the force or pressure against the arteries by the blood as it's pumped around the body. It is recorded as two measurements: Systolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart squeezes (the higher number). Diastolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart relaxes between heartbeats (the lower number). Normal blood pressure for an adult, relaxed at rest, is 100-120 over 80. The 100-120 is the systolic pressure; the diastolic pressure is 80. Blood pressure readings are written like fractions. For example, 120/80. Blood pressure may go up or down depending on your: Age Heart condition Emotions Activity Medications One high reading doesn't mean you have high blood pressure. You have to measure your blood pressure at different times while resting to find out your typical value. Your doctor can also tell about your heart's health by examining other parts of your body like your arms, legs, and skin. Your doctor may look for fluid in the lungs with a stethoscope. People with heart failure may also have enlarged neck veins, swelling of the legs or abdomen, or an enlarged liver. Your doctor may recommend blood tests to check your cholesterol and other things that may signal heart disease."
238,"If you have diabetes, you know lots of things -- from eating too much, to missing a snack, to plain old stress -- can affect your blood sugar. But did you know just getting older could make it harder to control? There's a lot going on in your body as you age. If you become more of a couch potato as you get up in years, you may gain weight. This lack of exercise and the extra pounds can send your blood sugar levels too high. And as you age, your body doesn't use the insulin it makes as well as it did when you were younger. Your body also starts making less of some hormones, including the human growth hormone. Women will create less estrogen and progesterone, and men often produce less of the sex hormone testosterone. And as you get older, you may be more prone to illness and infections that can spike your blood sugar. Don't worry too much, though. Middle age doesn't mean you have to make dramatic changes to control your diabetes. It's just good to be aware of things that might pop up. As women get older, hormone changes before and during menopause often cause hot flashes, irritability, and trouble sleeping. Not only do these drops or spikes in the hormones impact your mood and life, but they can also affect your blood sugar. These ups and downs mean may mean you have to test your levels and make adjustments more often. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may notice low blood sugar levels more often as you get closer to menopause. This can be a sign that your hormones are going down and you may need less insulin. It's important to know the difference between low blood sugar and moodiness or other perimenopause symptoms. You may reach menopause early if you have type 1 diabetes, but if you're overweight and have type 2, your changes could start later. That's because estrogen doesn't drop as quickly in heavier women. As your body's changing, it's easy to confuse signs of menopause with symptoms of high or low blood sugar. Dizziness, sweating, irritability, and trouble concentrating could all result from hormonal changes or from blood sugar that's too high or too low. The only way to know for sure -- and the safest thing to do -- is to test it. But checking too often can take an emotional toll. If you're worried, your doctor or diabetes educator can help you figure out how often to do it. If you can't get your blood sugar levels where they need to be, your doctor might suggest hormone replacement therapy ( HRT). If you've gone through menopause and you have diabetes, you may have a slightly higher chance of urinary tract and vaginal infections. Estrogen levels go down during menopause, causing vaginal dryness and other things. Testosterone, the hormone that helps control sex drive, muscle mass, and strength, naturally goes down as men get older. Low testosterone can cause insulin resistance, which means that your body's cells don't respond to insulin. Testosterone therapy can improve your blood sugar levels. As it turns out, the things you do to get a handle on diabetes as you enter midlife aren't that different than what you've been doing all along to stay healthy: Pay attention to your diabetes. That means you need to keep track of your blood sugar levels and talk to your doctor if they're are all over the place and you can't figure out why. Keep a record of your results and go over them with your doctor. Watch your weight. Eat a healthy diet. Get plenty of vegetables, choose whole-grain foods, and opt for lean proteins and low-fat dairy. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. It will give you more energy and boost your mood. You'll get the most benefit by doing a combination of an exercise that ups your heart rate -- like brisk walking -- along with strength training, like lifting weights."
239,"Rheumatoid arthritis is what doctors call an autoimmune condition. It starts when your immune system, which is supposed to protect you, goes awry and begins to attack your body's own tissues. It causes inflammation in the lining of your joints (the synovium). As a result, your joints may get red, warm, swollen, and painful. RA affects joints on both sides of the body, such as both hands, both wrists, or both knees. This symmetry helps to set it apart from other types of arthritis. Over time, RA can affect other body parts and systems, from your eyes to your heart, lungs, skin, blood vessels, and more. The warning signs of RA are: Joint pain and swelling Stiffness, especially in the morning or after you sit for a long time Fatigue Rheumatoid arthritis affects everyone differently. For some, joint symptoms happen gradually over several years. In others, it may come on quickly. Some people may have rheumatoid arthritis for a short time and then go into remission, which means they don't have symptoms. Anyone can get RA. It affects about 1% of Americans. The disease is 2 to 3 times more common in women than in men, but men tend to have more severe symptoms. It usually starts in middle age. But young children and the elderly also can get it. Doctors don't know the exact cause. Something seems to trigger the immune system to attack your joints and, sometimes, other organs. Some experts think a virus or bacteria may change your immune system, causing it to attack your joints. Other theories suggest that in some people, smoking may lead to rheumatoid arthritis. Certain genetic patterns may make some people more likely to get RA than others. Immune system cells move from the blood into your joints and the tissue that lines them. This is called the synovium. Once the cells arrive, they create inflammation. This makes your joint swell as fluid builds up inside it. Your joints become painful, swollen, and warm to the touch. Over time, the inflammation wears down the cartilage, a cushy layer of tissue that covers the ends of your bones. As you lose cartilage, the space between your bones narrows. As time goes on, they could rub against each other or move out of place. The cells that cause inflammation also make substances that damage your bones. The inflammation in RA can spread and affect organs and systems throughout your body, from your eyes to your heart, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, and even your skin. There is no single test that shows whether you have RA. Your doctor will give you a checkup, ask you about your symptoms, and possibly perform X-rays and blood tests. Rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed from a combination of things, including: The location and symmetry of painful joints, especially the hand joints Joint stiffness in the morning Bumps and nodules under the skin (rheumatoid nodules) Results of X-rays and blood tests In addition to checking for joint problems, your doctor will also do blood tests to diagnose RA. She'll be looking for: Anemia: People with rheumatoid arthritis may have a low number of red blood cells. C-reactive protein ( CRP): High levels are also signs of inflammation. Some people with rheumatoid arthritis may also have a positive antinuclear antibody test ( ANA), which indicates an autoimmune disease, but the test does not specify which autoimmune disease. Cyclic citrulline antibody test (anti- CCP): This more specific test checks for anti- CCP antibodies, which suggest you might have a more aggressive form of rheumatoid arthritis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR): How fast your blood clumps up in the bottom of a test tube shows there may be inflammation in your system. Rheumatoid factor ( RF): Most, but not all, people with rheumatoid arthritis have this antibody in their blood. But it can show up in people who don't have RA. Treatments include medications, rest, exercise, and, in some cases, surgery to correct joint damage. Your options will depend on several things, including your age, overall health, medical history, and how severe your case is. Many rheumatoid arthritis medications can ease joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Some of these drugs prevent or slow down the disease. Drugs that ease joint pain and stiffness include: Anti-inflammatory painkillers, like aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen Pain relievers that you rub on your skin Corticosteroids, like prednisone Narcotic pain relievers Your doctor may also give you strong medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). They work by interfering with or suppressing your immune system's attack on your joints. Traditional DMARDs are often the first-line treatment for RA: Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil), which was created to treat malaria Methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall), which was first developed to treat cancer Leflunomide ( Arava) Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Biologic response modifiers are man made versions of proteins in human genes. They're an option if your RA is more severe, or if DMARDs didn't help. You might even take a biologic and a DMARD together. The doctor could also give you a biosimilar. These new drugs are near-exact copies of biologics that cost less. Biologics approved for RA include: Abatacept ( Orencia), Adalimumab ( Humira), adalimumab-atto ( Amjevita) Anakinra ( Kineret) Baricitinib ( Olumiant) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel), etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) Golimumab ( Simponi, Simponi Aria) Infliximab ( Remicade), infliximab-dyyb ( Inflectra) Rituximab ( Rituxan) Sarilumab ( Kevzara) Tocilizumab ( Actemra) Tofacitinib ( Xeljanz) Upadacitinib ( Rinvoq) You need to be active, but you also have to pace yourself. During flare-ups, when inflammation gets worse, it's best to rest your joints. Using a cane or joint splints can help. When the inflammation eases, it's a good idea to exercise. It'll keep your joints flexible and strengthen the muscles that surround them. Low-impact activities, like brisk walking or swimming, and gentle stretching can help. You may want to work with a physical therapist at first. When joint damage from rheumatoid arthritis has become severe, surgery may help. Although there isn't a cure for rheumatoid arthritis, early, aggressive treatment will help prevent disability and increase your chances of remission."
240,"Schizophrenia changes how you think, feel, and act. It might affect you differently from someone else. The symptoms can come and go, too. No one has all of them all of the time. They usually start between ages 16 and 30. Men often get them earlier than women. Oftentimes there is a gradual change in the person before obvious symptoms start. This is sometimes called the prodrome phase. When the disease is in full swing and symptoms are severe, the person with schizophrenia can't tell when certain ideas and perceptions they have are real or not. This happens less often as they get older. People with the condition usually aren't aware that they have it until a doctor or counselor tells them. They won't even realize that something is seriously wrong. If they do happen to notice symptoms, like not being able to think straight, they might chalk it up to things like stress or being tired. If you're concerned that you or someone you know is showing signs of schizophrenia, talk to a doctor or counselor. Positive symptoms are highly exaggerated ideas, perceptions, or actions that show the person can't tell what's real from what isn't. Here the word ""positive"" means the presence (rather than absence) of symptoms. They can include: Hallucinations. People with schizophrenia might hear, see, smell, or feel things no one else does. The types of hallucinations in schizophrenia include: Auditory. The person most often hears voices in their head. They might be angry or urgent and demand that they do things. It can sound like one voice or many. They might whisper, murmur, or be angry and demanding. Visual. Someone might see lights, objects, people, or patterns. Often it's loved ones or friends who are no longer alive. They may also have trouble with depth perception and distance. Olfactory and gustatory. This can include good and bad smells and tastes. Someone might believe they're being poisoned and refuse to eat. Tactile. This creates a feeling of things moving on your body, like hands or insects. Delusions. These are beliefs that seem strange to most people and are easy to prove wrong. The person affected might think someone is trying to control their brain through TVs or that the FBI is out to get them. They might believe they're someone else, like a famous actor or the president, or that they have superpowers. Types of delusions include: Persecutory delusions. The feeling someone is after you or that you're being stalked, hunted, framed, or tricked. Referential delusions. When a person believes that public forms of communication, like song lyrics or a gesture from a TV host, are a special message just for them. Somatic delusions. These center on the body. The person thinks they have a terrible illness or bizarre health problem like worms under the skin or damage from cosmic rays. Erotomanic delusions. A person might be convinced a celebrity is in love with them or that their partner is cheating. Or they might think people they're not attracted to are pursuing them. Religious delusions. Someone might think they have a special relationship with a deity or that they're possessed by a demon. Grandiose delusions. They consider themselves a major figure on the world stage, like an entertainer or a politician. Confused thoughts and disorganized speech. People with schizophrenia can have a hard time organizing their thoughts. They might not be able to follow along when you talk to them. Instead, it might seem like they're zoning out or distracted. When they talk, their words can come out jumbled and not make sense. Trouble concentrating. For example, someone might lose track of what's going on in a TV show as they're watching. Movement disorders . Some people with schizophrenia can seem jumpy. Sometimes they'll make the same movements over and over again. But sometimes they might be perfectly still for hours at a stretch, which experts call being catatonic. Contrary to popular belief, people with the disease usually aren't violent. Negative symptoms refer to an absence or lack of normal mental function involving thinking, behavior, and perception. You might notice: Lack of pleasure. The person may not seem to enjoy anything anymore. A doctor will call this anhedonia. Trouble with speech. They might not talk much or show any feelings. Doctors call this alogia. Flattening: The person with schizophrenia might seem like they have a terrible case of the blahs. When they talk, their voice can sound flat, like they have no emotions. They may not smile normally or show usual facial emotions in response to conversations or things happening around them. A doctor might call this affective flattening. Withdrawal. This might include no longer making plans with friends or becoming a hermit. Talking to the person can feel like pulling teeth: If you want an answer, you have to really work to pry it out of them. Doctors call this apathy. Struggling with the basics of daily life. They may stop bathing or taking care of themselves. No follow-through. People with schizophrenia have trouble staying on schedule or finishing what they start. Sometimes they can't get started at all. A doctor might call this avolition. Depression has some of the same symptoms, too. They can be hard to spot, especially in teens, because even healthy teens can have big emotional swings between highs and lows. These symptoms reflect how well the person's brain learns, stores, and uses information. Someone with schizophrenia might have a hard time with their working memory. For example, they may not be able to keep track of different kinds of facts at the same time, like a phone number plus instructions. Along with having trouble paying attention, it can be hard for them to organize their thoughts and make decisions."
241,"Are you more likely to catch the flu this season? What about your family members or colleagues? Knowing what boosts your odds of getting the illness can help you and those around you avoid it. You're most likely to get the flu if you don't get immunized against it. The best way to avoid catching it is to get an annual flu vaccine. Because the strain of flu virus changes over time, doctors come out with a new vaccine every year. So, it's important to stay current and get vaccinated each year -- preferably by November. But anytime before flu season begins or even during is good. The American Lung Association offers an online flu-vaccine clinic locator. Visit the site, enter your zip code and a date (or dates), and you'll get info about clinics scheduled in your area. There's also a nasal flu vaccine called Flu Mist, which contains weakened live viruses. Don't get this nasal spray vaccine if you're pregnant, if you have HIV/ AIDS or another medical condition that weakens your immune system. Flu Mist is approved for healthy people between 2 and 49 years old. In addition, there is a âneedle-lessâ option for people 18-64 years old: the jet injector vaccine with Afluria, which uses a tool with high pressure to deliver the vaccine. Frequent and thorough hand washing is key to keeping the flu away. Wash often during the day, and use warm water. Scrub them clean for about 20 seconds -- as long as it takes to sing â Happy Birthdayâ twice. Teach your family members to do the same. Keep hand sanitizer with you at all times in case you can't get to a sink. Remember, the flu is spread by people who are already infected. The most common ""hot spots"" for the virus are surfaces that an infected person has touched and rooms where she's been recently, especially areas where the person has sneezed. Your immune system may not be up to par if you don't eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise and plenty of sleep, and manage your stress. Pregnant women have changes in their immune system, heart and lungs, which makes them vulnerable to more severe illness from the flu. The flu can also cause problems with the pregnancy and the baby. The flu shot is safe for pregnant women and can be given in any trimester. The nasal vaccine should not be given to pregnant women. Children under 2 years old are at high risk for flu-related problems. A youngster's growing immune system is always fighting off new viruses and bacteria. It's normal for a tot to get as many as six to eight colds a year, along with ear and sinus infections, bronchitis, and croup. A kid who's often sick or who has a weak immune system is more likely to catch the flu and have complications with it. How can you protect your child? Watch what he puts in his mouth. Wash teething rings, pacifiers, and other ""mouth"" toys often with soap and water, then dry them. Wash his hands with soap and water often. Replace his toothbrush frequently, and keep it apart from other family members' brushes. If you have a newborn, it's important to protect him from people who have flu symptoms. Ask your day care about its ""sick child"" policy. Can parents drop off kids who have fever or other symptoms? Babies under 6 months can't get flu shots. That means parents, family members, and caregivers should get vaccinated to protect little ones from the flu. As you age, your immune system weakens, and the flu can take more of a toll on you. Seniors also have a higher risk for getting other problems along with the flu. Most people who wind up in the hospital or die from the flu are 65 or older. Folks in this age group are also more likely to have a long-term illness like heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease that make them more likely to get the flu. A high-dose vaccine called Fluzone is recommended for those 65 and older. It has four times as much active ingredient as a regular flu shot. That means it can do a better job of getting an older immune system up and running. People who live in crowded places are more likely to get the flu. If you or a loved one is over 65, talk to a doctor about a flu shot plus the pneumococcal vaccines. It can protect you from more than 20 types of bacteria that cause serious diseases like meningitis, pneumonia, and blood infections. If you're a healthy adult over 65, you should get two different pneumococcal vaccines. The timing and sequence will vary. Doctors may suggest this vaccine for some younger adults, particularly those with a higher risk for infections because of liver or heart disease, COPD, kidney failure, diabetes, cancer, and other chronic illnesses."
242,"The ovaries are an important part of the female reproductive system. Their job is twofold. They produce the hormones, including estrogen, that trigger menstruation. They also release at least one egg each month for possible fertilization. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A number of different conditions, from cysts to tumors, can cause ovarian pain. The ovaries are located in the lower abdomen. That means if you have ovarian pain, you'll most likely feel it in your lower abdomen -- below your belly button -- and pelvis. It's important to have any pelvic pain checked out by your regular doctor or obstetrician/gynecologist. Several different conditions can cause it. Pain in the ovaries can either be acute or chronic. Acute ovarian pain comes on quickly (over a few minutes or days) and goes away in a short period of time. Chronic ovarian pain usually starts more gradually. Then it last for several months or longer. Ovarian pain may be continuous. Or it may come and go. It may get worse with certain activities, such as exercise or urination. It can be so mild that you hardly notice it. Or pain in the ovaries can be so severe that it interferes with daily life. The methods your doctor uses to diagnose ovarian pain will vary. They will be based on what the suspected cause might be. Regardless, your doctor will take a complete medical history, do a physical exam, and ask questions about your pain. The questions might include: Where are you feeling the pain? When did it start? How often do you feel pain? Does an activity make the pain better or worse? How does it feel -- mild, burning, achy, sharp? How does the pain affect your day-to-day life? Diagnostic tests, such as ultrasound and other types of imaging, can zero in on the cause of the pain. Here is a rundown of some possible causes of ovarian pain and how they are diagnosed and treated. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can form in the ovaries. They are very common in women, especially during the childbearing years. Often they form during the process of ovulation. It can happen when the egg is not released or when the sac -- follicle -- holding the egg doesn't dissolve after the egg is released. Ovarian cysts usually cause no symptoms and dissolve on their own. They can, though, create a dull ache or a sharp pain if the cyst is large and it ruptures. Other symptoms of ovarian cysts: Irregular menstrual periods Pain during intercourse or bowel movements Nausea or vomiting Feeling full after eating a small amount Bloating How ovarian cysts are diagnosed Pelvic exam. This exam may reveal a lump in the pelvic area. Ultrasound. This scan uses sound waves to create an image of the ovaries. This helps the doctor determine the size and location of a cyst. Treatment of ovarian cysts Watchful waiting. Most ovarian cysts will go away on their own. If you don't have any bothersome symptoms, especially if you haven't yet gone through menopause, your doctor may advocate ""watchful waiting."" The doctor won't treat you. Instead, the doctor might check you periodically to see if there has been any change in your condition. Laparoscopy. This is a form of surgery that uses small incisions and a tiny, lighted camera on the end of a metal tube that's inserted into the abdomen to remove small cysts. Larger cysts may need to be removed through a bigger incision in the abdomen. This is done with a technique called laparotomy. Birth control pills . Birth control pills prevent ovulation. That, in turn, reduces the formation of new cysts. Tumors can form in the ovaries, just as they form in other parts of the body. They can be either noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Other symptoms of ovarian tumors Bloating or pressure in the abdomen Urgent need to urinate Indigestion Diarrhea or constipation Loss of appetite/feeling full Unintentional weight loss or gain in the stomach area How ovarian tumors are diagnosed Computed tomography ( CT), magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI), and positron emission tomography( PET). These are detailed imaging scans that the doctor can use to find ovarian tumors. They allow the doctor to determine whether and how far the ovarian tumors have spread. CA-125. This is a blood test to look for a protein that tends to be higher in some (but not all) women with ovarian cancer. CA-125 isn't effective as a screening test for ovarian cancer. But it can be checked in women with symptoms that might be caused by ovarian cancer. Treatment of ovarian tumors Laparotomy. This is surgery performed through an incision into the abdomen. The surgeon will remove as much of the tumor as possible. The removal of tumor tissue is called debulking. If the tumor is cancerous and has spread, the surgeon may also remove the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, omentum (fatty tissue covering the intestines), and nearby lymph nodes. Laparoscopy and robotic surgery may also be used. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy involves drugs given through a vein ( IV), by mouth, or directly into the abdomen. The drugs kill cancer cells. Because they kill normal cells as well, chemotherapy medications can have side effects. These can include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, kidney damage, and increased risk of infection. These side effects should go away after the treatment is stopped. Radiation. This treatment uses high-energy X-rays to kill or shrink cancer cells. Radiation is either delivered from outside the body, or placed inside the body near the site of the tumor. This treatment also can cause side effects. These can include inflamed skin, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. Radiation is not often used to treat ovarian cancer. Learn more about the types of ovarian tumors. Every month, the lining of the uterus builds up in preparation to nourish a growing fetus. When an egg is not fertilized, that lining sheds and is released from the body via menstruation. In some women, tissue like the lining of the uterus develops elsewhere in the body. This tissue swells and bleeds each month. It has nowhere to shed, though, and may form scar tissue that can be very painful. Other symptoms of endometriosis Painful periods Pain during intercourse Heavy menstrual periods Infertility Pain with bowel movements How endometriosis is diagnosed Medical history and physical exam. Ultrasound and MRI. These scans may help the doctor to spot endometriosis, if there is an endometrioma, a benign cyst, on the ovary or ovaries. Laparoscopy. This procedure uses a thin lighted scope inserted into a tiny hole in the abdomen to allow the doctor to visualize the ovaries. The doctor may possibly remove a small sample of tissue for biopsy, a procedure in which the endometriosis may also be removed entirely. Treatment of endometriosis Pain medications. Drugs such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) can help relieve some of the discomfort of endometriosis. Birth control pills. The pill prevents the monthly buildup of endometrial tissue on the ovaries and anywhere else the endometriosis may be in the abdomen and pelvis. This makes periods lighter and reduces the symptoms of endometriosis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists ( Gn RH agonists). These drugs reduce the amount of the hormone estrogen in the body. By slowing the growth of endometriosis, they limit its symptoms. Laparoscopy and laparotomy. These are surgical procedures that let the doctor remove endometriosis on the ovaries and other places. If the endometriosis is extensive, the doctor may recommend a hysterectomy. This procedure removes the uterus and sometimes also the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Learn more about laparoscopic surgery to treat endometriosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) is an infection in the ovaries, uterus, or fallopian tubes. It is most often caused by sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea or chlamydia. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Other symptoms of PID Pain during intercourse Fever Vaginal discharge that may have a smell Irregular menstrual bleeding Diarrhea Vomiting Fatigue Difficulty urinating How PID is diagnosed Pelvic exam. The exam will enable your doctor to look for any lumps, abnormal discharge, or tenderness in the pelvis. Blood and urine tests. These lab tests can help identify the infection. So can cultures of any discharge seen during a pelvic exam. Ultrasound. This test creates an image of the pelvic area so the doctor can see if the reproductive organs are enlarged. The doctor can also see if there is a pocket of infection known as an abscess. Laparoscopy. Occasionally this procedure, which uses a thin lighted scope inserted into a tiny hole in the abdomen, is used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of PID Antibiotics. These drugs are given by mouth or through an injection. They can kill the bacteria that are causing PID. If you are taking antibiotics for PID, your sexual partner or partners should also get treated. There is a high likelihood that your partner has the same sexually transmitted infection. Learn more about the treatments for pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID). Surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries is known as hysterectomy and oophorectomy. A bilateral salping- oophorectomy is a procedure in which both fallopian tubes and ovaries are removed. In rare cases, a small piece of the ovary may accidentally be left behind. The remnant can grow and develop painful cysts. Other symptoms of ovarian remnant syndrome Pain during intercourse Difficulty urinating How ovarian remnant syndrome is diagnosed Ultrasound, CT, and MRI. These scans create images of the area. They help the doctor locate the remaining piece of ovary tissue. Treatment of ovarian remnant syndrome Laparotomy or laparoscopy. These procedures are done to remove the remaining piece or pieces of ovary. Learn more about ovary removal surgery."
243,"Food poisoning is a common problem -- but it's also one that can often be prevented. Many cases are mild and you get better without treatment. But some cases may be so severe that you need to go to a hospital for treatment. To avoid getting a food-borne illness in the first place, there are some general guidelines to follow. Raw foods from animals are the most likely sources of contamination. Be mindful when handling and preparing: Meat and poultry: Avoid eating raw or spoiled meat. Be careful that you don't let juices or drippings from raw meat and poultry -- or for that matter shellfish and eggs -- touch other foods you plan to serve or eat. Shellfish and raw fish: Carefully pick out and cook fish and shellfish to ensure quality and freshness. Eggs and dairy: You'll want to be sure that your family is safe when enjoying eggs and dairy products. Some tips: Don't drink unpasteurized milk. Pasteurized foods are heated before being sold to kill bacteria. Avoid soft cheeses such as feta, brie, camembert, blue-veined, and Mexican-style cheese -- or other unpasteurized cheeses. Hard cheeses, processed cheeses, cream cheese, and cottage cheese are safe. Check the expiration dates on eggs before purchasing and again before preparing. Vegetables: These can also be the source of food poisoning, particularly sprouts of all kinds (alfalfa, mung, clover, and radish). This is because sprouting requires warmer temperatures, which are ideal for bacterial growth. Avoid raw sprouts if you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system. A couple of other food-related tips: Don't set out eggs, meats, poultry, seafood, or milk at room temperature for long. Refrigerate leftovers right after you eat. Drink only pasteurized juice or cider. The first rule of safe cooking is to wash your hands frequently. But there are plenty of other things to clean. Wash cutting boards and knives with antibacterial soap and warm to hot water after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Wooden cutting boards are not recommended, because they can be harder to clean. Do not thaw foods at room temperature. Thaw foods in the refrigerator and use them promptly. Do not refreeze foods if they have been thawed all the way. Use a clean thermometer that can tell you the inner temperature of cooked foods. That way, you can be sure meat, poultry, and other foods are cooked all the way through. Here are a few specifics on that: Cook roasts and steaks to at least 145 F. Whole poultry should be cooked to 165 F for doneness. Cook ground beef (hamburger) to at least 160 F. Ground chicken or turkey should be cooked to 165 F. Cook foods until they are steaming hot, especially leftover foods or ready-to-eat foods, such as hot dogs. Some other tips: Keep the refrigerator at 40 F or lower. Set the freezer at 0 F. Wash raw vegetables and fruits well before eating, especially those that will not be cooked. If you like to can foods at home, make sure you know the safety guidelines. You can get instructions from county extension services or the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Although the chance of getting food-borne disease from deli counter food is low, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems may wish to avoid these foods. If you are served an undercooked meat or egg product in a restaurant, send it back for more cooking. You should also ask for a new plate. Some other tips: Check the inspection scores of the places where you eat. You can check online before you go or after you arrive. Look around -- is the restaurant clean? If it's not, think about going elsewhere. If you take home leftovers, refrigerate them within 2 hours. If it's above 90 F, make that 1 hour. Who doesn't love a vacation? But you need to be careful when you travel, especially to developing countries. Here are some tips to avoid food poisoning no matter where you are in the world: Go for hot foods: Heat kills germs. You should be OK with food that's served steaming hot. Eat packaged or dry foods: Many of the bugs that cause food poisoning prefer moisture. Dry foods such as bread or chips or factory-sealed foods such as tuna are usually a safe bet. Go for bottled, canned, or hot drinks: Carbonated drinks are a good choice, because the bubbles will tell you it's been sealed properly. You should be good with coffee or tea if it arrives steaming hot. Avoid the following: Raw food Local wild game Tap water and ice in developing countries Breastfeed your baby if possible. Mother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breastfeeding may prevent many food-borne illnesses and other health problems. Wash your hands with soap after handling reptiles, turtles, birds, or after contact with human or pet feces. If you are ill with diarrhea or vomiting, do not prepare food for others, especially infants, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, because they are more likely to get sick from an infection. Always wash your hands before: Preparing food Eating Always wash your hands after: Using the toilet Changing diapers Coughing or sneezing"
244,"Surgery can often cure long-term ulcerative colitis ( UC), but it's not for everyone. Your doctor may suggest an operation if your UC is severe and you don't get enough help from other treatments, like medicines and changes in your diet. It could also be an option to help you prevent colon cancer. There are two procedures. Both are major surgery on your digestive system. Get to know the details of each operation, and talk with your doctor about which one he recommends for you. What it is. In this procedure, also called IPAA (ileal pouch-anal anastomosis), your surgeon removes the part of your bowel that's causing trouble, including your colon and rectum. He'll use the end of your small intestine, called the ileum, to make a pouch inside your body that collects waste. Then he'll connect the pouch to your anus. What are the side effects? The pouch can become irritated or inflamed, which is called pouchitis. Antibiotics usually take care of the problem. What to expect after the surgery. Because muscles around your anus aren't affected, you'll eventually be able to get rid of food waste the usual way, on the toilet. At first, you'll need to wear a bag outside your body over a stoma -- a surgical hole in your belly connected to your intestine -- to remove the solid waste, while your new internal pouch heals. You'll still go to the bathroom often, but probably not as much as before the operation. In time, you may go even less frequently. You may find that you can eat more foods than before you had the surgery, or you may feel better with your familiar foods. Try items one at a time to see how you feel. And don't eat within 3-4 hours of bedtime. Give your recovery some time. Most people eventually get back to all of their usual activities. In the meantime, if you find that you tire out faster than usual, remember that you're healing from the operation. Your doctor can let you know about any limits you should have during your recovery. For instance, women who get the surgery should avoid sex for 6 weeks. What it is. The surgeon removes your colon, rectum, and anus. This operation reroutes part of your digestive system so food waste goes from your small intestine straight out of your body through a hole, or stoma. It collects in an external pouch, or bag, that's connected to the outside of your lower belly. You change it when it gets full. Your ileostomy may be permanent, or you might get it as a temporary measure before you get a J-pouch. What are the side effects? As with any operation, there is a chance of infection. What to expect afterward. You should be able to go back to many of your daily activities in about 4 to 6 weeks. You may need more time before you can do things that are physically hard, like heavy lifting. You can wear your regular clothes and even shower with the pouch on. It shouldn't show under your clothes or affect how you dress, but you might want to keep tight belts off of the stoma. If the bag is on securely, no one should smell any odors. It will probably take time to adjust to living with the stoma and the ileostomy system. But you should get used to emptying the pouch with a little practice. When you eat: Chew your food well. You may need to limit fiber, such as popcorn, foods with seeds, nuts, and raw veggies. Avoid gassy foods such as soda and beans. You can feel confident about being back in your regular routine. Once you've healed, you can do everything you did before the operation -- go to work, play sports, have sex. But it is an adjustment, so talk to your doctor about how you can handle this change."
245,"When you have diabetes, your chance of heart disease goes up, so you may need tests that check how well your ticker is working. They'll help your doctor see if you have signs of heart trouble and figure out the best treatment for you. Blood pressure check. It's a painless test that uses a special meter to measure the force of blood pushing against your vessel walls. If you don't get your high blood pressure under control, you could get health problems like: Stroke Heart attack Heart failure Kidney failure Carotid ultrasound. It uses high-frequency sound waves to give your doctor a view of your major neck arteries, called the carotids. He'll be able to see if you have any narrowing of your arteries that's caused by a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque. Computerized tomography ( CT) of the heart and calcium scores. This imaging test can spot calcium deposits in vessels on your heart. More calcium means more coronary atherosclerosis -- a hardening and narrowing of your arteries. Your doctor uses the test results to figure out your odds of having heart trouble. Electrocardiogram ( EKG). It's a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Your doctor will be able to check for things like: Heart rhythms that aren't normal A larger-than-usual heart chamber Poor blood flow Heart attack Ambulatory electrocardiogram ( Holter monitor). This test measures the electrical activity of your heart while you go about your regular daily activities. Echocardiograph (echo). It uses ultrasound to give your doctor a graphic outline of your heart chambers and their movement. He'll be able to check your heart's structure and motion, and see how thick the heart muscle is and how well the heart pumps. Exercise stress test. It's a treadmill test that helps your doctor find out how much blood flow gets to your heart muscle when it works hard, like while you exercise. You'll learn if you have less blood flow in the arteries that send blood to your heart muscle. Your doctor can use this info to figure out what a safe level of exercise is for you. Coronary angiography. This procedure, also known as cardiac catheterization, can help your doctor check how many artery blockages you have and how severe they are."
246,"That itchy red rash between your toes might be athlete's foot. It can spread to your toenails, your soles, and up the sides of your feet. And if you handle your feet, it can also infect your hands. Athlete's foot can happen on one or both feet, and there are different types. But with any kind you have, you'll probably see: Itchy, scaly red rash between your toes Small, red blisters (usually on your soles or between your toes) Ongoing dryness and scaling on the soles and up the sides of your foot Ulcers or sores that leak fluid, smell bad, and look red The fungus that causes ringworm and jock itch is usually the one to blame for athlete's foot. It loves damp shoes, socks, and all warm, moist areas where it can grow like crazy. It's very contagious. If you spend much time at a gym or public swimming pool, you're more likely to get it. It spreads easily from person to person through contact with contaminated surfaces like floors, shoes, and towels. You should treat athlete's foot as soon as you notice even minor symptoms. It's fine to try over-the-counter products, or you may have a home remedy you like to use. But sometimes they don't work, and that's when you need to make an appointment with your doctor. You may need prescription-strength medicine to kill the athlete's foot fungus if: You have diabetes and the rash looks infected The scaly rash has turned into sores or ulcers that leak fluid It's spread to your hands or groin You think your toenails are infected The rash just won't disappear"
247,"Does scaly skin have you itchy and uncomfortable? It may just be ordinary dry skin. But if over-the-counter products don't help you heal, you could have a medical condition that requires a doctor's care. There are several reasons for scaly skin. Whether you have a flaky scalp from time to time or scratchy patches all the time, a dermatologist can tell you if your symptoms are due to a lack of moisture or something more serious. Normally, your body sheds about 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells each day and replaces them with new ones. You don't feel the skin cells growing and shouldn't see any falling, or flaking, off. The outer layer of your skin contains a mixture of dead skin cells and natural oils, which help it hold on to water. If this layer is damaged and moisture gets out, or if your skin cell renewal process goes off the rails, you could get flaky or scaly. Aging, exposure to sunlight and harsh chemicals, some medicines, and certain diseases could also be to blame. If you or your child has red, scaly patches that itch a lot, it might be eczema. This common condition is often mistaken for dry, sensitive skin. Babies and children usually get crusty spots on their chins and cheeks, but scaly skin can show up anywhere on the body. Hand eczema can cause the skin on your palms and fingers to get dry, thick, and cracked. The skin may burn or bleed. Children often outgrow eczema. But adults who never had it can get it, too. Doctors don't know what causes it. They think it's a mix of genetics and things in your environment that your skin reacts to, like: Wool Soap Perfume Makeup Chlorine Cigarette smoke You might notice these symptoms: Red, irritated, or swollen skin Crusting or oozing Scaly patches that feel rough or leathery Severe itching Silvery white scales that cover thick red, raised patches of skin are a telltale sign of plaque psoriasis. Doctors think it results from a faulty immune system. New skin cells grow faster than normal, but old skin cells fail to fall off. The new and old cells clump together, causing thick, itchy patches, sores, and scales There are several different types of psoriasis. Scaly skin is most common with plaque psoriasis. It can show up on your knees, scalp, elbows, palms, lower back and the soles of your feet. The condition may also cause your nails to pit, crumble, or fall off. Psoriasis can be passed down through families. Infections, stress, obesity, and smoking can increase your risk for psoriasis. It isn't contagious. Red, irritated, or scaly skin on your baby's bottom is likely due to diaper dermatitis -- better known as diaper rash. This common condition is usually seen in infants ages 9 to 12 months. It shows up around the folds of the thighs and genitals -- places covered by a diaper Diaper rash can result from an allergy or irritated skin. It could also be a yeast infection -- yeast thrives in warm, moist environments. Signs include a reddish irritated skin rash. At-home care may be fine for irritation rashes, but if your baby's diaper rash won't go away, see a doctor to figure out the cause and best treatment. This skin disorder is the most common cause of dandruff. White, oily flakes of dead skin in your hair and on your shoulders and, sometimes, an itchy scalp are signs of regular dandruff. If you have seborrheic dermatitis, your scalp and nearby skin will feel greasy and be dotted with yellow or white crusty scales. You may even find flakes in your eyebrows. This type of dandruff can also affect the skin behind your ears and on the sides of your nose. A flaky, scaly patch that comes and goes could be actinic keratosis ( AK), a precancerous condition. You could get this scaly skin problem if you spend too much time in a tanning bed or unprotected in the sun. Without treatment, it can turn into squamous cell skin cancer. If you get one actinic keratosis, you usually will get another. The main symptom is a thick, scaly, discolored patch of skin. Sometimes the area feels rough or like sandpaper but looks normal. It may be painful to touch. It can flake off, and your skin may feel normal again. However, the problem spot typically comes back when you're exposed to sunlight. This common condition begins as shiny, reddish-purple bumps. As more grow, they create thick clumps of rough, scaly skin, usually on your ankles and shins. The bumps may also show up on your wrists, lower back, and genitals. They often itch and might blister. Lichen planus can also affect the inside of your mouth and your nails. Middle-aged adults are most likely to get it. Doctors aren't sure what causes lichen planus. It may be an autoimmune disorder. It's often seen in people who have hepatitis C. If you get it, ask your doctor about screening for hepatitis. This group of scaly skin diseases is most often passed down through families. The lifelong condition usually appears in childhood. A genetic problem causes skin cells to build up, creating thick, dry areas that look like fish scales. Certain medicines or diseases, including kidney failure, some cancers, and HIV, can trigger it. If this happens, it's called acquired ichthyosis. There are several forms. Ichthyosis vulgaris (fish scale disease) is common and may be mild. It can go undiagnosed if you keep your skin well-moisturized. Women or girls ages 10 to 35 are more likely to get this skin condition. The main sign is a single round, rose- or tan-colored spot (called a herald patch) in the middle of your body, arms, or legs. A cluster of scaly patches follows about a week or two later. The round spots have raised borders. There may be little or no scaly skin symptoms in children or pregnant women. Doctors think a viral infection (like herpesvirus 6, 7, or 8) causes this scaly rash. It's easy to mistake for ringworm. Other symptoms may include fatigue and headache. A reddish-purple, scaly rash followed by muscle weakness are the main symptoms of this inflammatory disorder. Women are most likely get it. It can occur at any age. It causes swelling in the blood vessels that feed your muscles and skin. You may notice a rash on your eyelids, nose, cheeks, elbows, knees, knuckles, upper chest, or back. Muscle weakness typically affects areas close to the middle of your body, like your hip, back, neck, and shoulders. Muscle pain isn't a main symptom, although some people do report muscle aches. If you have dry, scaly skin that doesn't go away, jot down any other symptoms you have and when they happen. Make an appointment to see a dermatologist. Moisturizers can help soothe some types of scaly skin, but not all. Ask your doctor about treatments for your specific condition."
248,"Every time you breathe in, air enters your nose and mouth. It flows down your throat and into a series of air passageways called bronchial tubes. Those tubes need to be open for the air to reach your lungs, where the oxygen is passed into the blood to be transported to your body's tissues. If the airways are inflamed, air has more difficulty getting to your lungs. With less air getting in, you can feel short of breath. You may wheeze and cough in an attempt to draw in more oxygen through tightened passageways. Bronchitis and asthma are two inflammatory airway conditions. Acute bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of the airways that usually resolves itself after running its course. It's caused by viral or bacterial infections. Chronic bronchitis, which is longer lasting, can be triggered by long-term exposure to environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke, dust, or chemicals. Asthma is an inflammatory condition that leads to tightening of the muscles around the airways and swelling that cause airways to narrow. When asthma and acute bronchitis occur together, the condition is called asthmatic bronchitis. There are many triggers that may initiate the release of inflammatory substances. Common asthmatic bronchitis triggers include: Tobacco smoke Pollution Allergens such as pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, or food (and food additives like MSG) Chemicals Certain medications (aspirin, beta-blockers) Exercise Weather changes (for example, cold weather) Viral or bacterial infections Strong emotions (laughing or crying) The symptoms of asthmatic bronchitis are a combination of the symptoms of bronchitis and asthma. You may experience some or all of the following symptoms: Shortness of breath Wheezing Cough Chest tightness Excess mucus production You might wonder, is asthmatic bronchitis contagious? Bronchitis itself can be caused by a virus or bacteria, which are contagious. However, chronic asthmatic bronchitis typically is not contagious. If you've been experiencing symptoms like those listed above, make an appointment with your doctor. After going through a series of questions about your symptoms and taking a medical history and physical exam, your doctor may order tests such as: Spirometry. A test that measures lung function as you breathe in and out of a mouthpiece that is attached to a device called a spirometer. Peak expiratory flow. A test that measures the force of air you breathe out (exhale) into the mouthpiece of a device called a peak expiratory flow meter. Chest X-ray. A radiology test that produces images of the chest to look for evidence of other conditions that could be causing your cough and breathing problems. Asthmatic bronchitis treatments are essentially the same as those used to treat asthma and bronchitis, and may include: Short-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol, to help open the airway to provide short-term relief Inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting bronchodilators used together with inhaled corticosteroids Leukotriene modifiers Cromolyn or theophylline Combination inhalers containing both a steroid and a bronchodilator Long-acting anticholinergics A humidifier or steam Bacterial respiratory infection may be treated with antibiotics. Treatment also involves avoiding asthma triggers by following these tips: Wash your bed linens and blankets in hot water. Dust and vacuum regularly. Use a HEPA air filter in your home. Keep pets out of your bedroom. Don't smoke, and try to stay away from other people who smoke. Wash your hands frequently to prevent the spread of infection."
249,"Arthritis is a general term that means inflammation in joints. Osteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease, is the most common type of arthritis. It is associated with a breakdown of cartilage in joints and can occur in almost any joint in the body. It most commonly occurs in the weight-bearing joints of the hips, knees, and spine. It can also affect the fingers, thumb, neck, and large toe. It is not typically common in other joints unless prior injury or excessive stress is involved. Osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million Americans. The chance of developing the disease increases with age. Most people over age 60 have osteoarthritis to some degree, but its severity varies. Even people in their 20s and 30s can get osteoarthritis. In people over age 50, more women than men get osteoarthritis. Joint aching and soreness, especially with movement Pain and/or stiffness after overuse or after long periods of inactivity Bony enlargements in the middle and end joints of the fingers (which may or may not be painful) Osteoarthritis is not associated with fever, weight loss, or anemia (low red-blood cell count). If these symptoms are present in someone with osteoarthritis, they are caused by a condition unrelated to the osteoarthritis. There are several factors that increase the risk for developing osteoarthritis, including heredity, obesity, injury, or overuse of certain joints. People born with joint abnormalities are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. Some people have an inherited defect in one of the genes responsible for making collagen, a major component of cartilage. This causes defective cartilage, which leads to more rapid deterioration of joints. Finally, people who are born with an abnormality of the spine (such as scoliosis or curvature of the spine) are more likely to develop osteoarthritis of the spine. Obesity increases the risk for osteoarthritis. Maintaining ideal weight or losing excess weight may help prevent osteoarthritis, or decrease the rate of progression once osteoarthritis is established. Injuries contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. For example, athletes who have knee-related injuries may be at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee. In addition, people who have had a severe back injury may be predisposed to develop osteoarthritis of the spine. People who have had a broken bone extending into the joint margin are prone to develop osteoarthritis in that joint. Overuse of certain joints increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis. For example, jobs requiring repeated knee bending increase the risk for osteoarthritis of the knee. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based on a combination of the following factors: Your description of symptoms The location and pattern of pain Certain findings during a physical exam Your doctor may use X-rays to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other types of arthritis. X-rays show how much joint damage has occurred. If fluid has accumulated in the joints, your doctor may remove some fluid from the joint (called joint aspiration) and examine it under a microscope to rule out other diseases. Although there is no blood test to diagnose osteoarthritis, some blood tests may be helpful to rule out other types of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is usually treated by reducing stress on the joints such as weight control and avoiding painful activity, physical therapy and exercise, application of heat or cold to the painful joint, medications, and use of supportive devices such as canes. Surgery may be helpful in severe cases to relieve pain when other treatment options have not been effective. The goals of treatment are to accomplish the following: Decrease joint pain and stiffness Improve joint mobility and stability Increase your ability to do daily activities The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the person's age, activities, occupation, overall health, medical history, and severity of the condition. Pain-relieving drugs include acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Some medications in the form of creams, rubs, or sprays may be applied over the skin of affected areas to relieve pain. Medications may be prescribed to reduce pain caused by osteoarthritis. Some medications may be injected into the affected joint to relieve symptoms. Unfortunately, drugs do not reverse or slow the progression of joint damage caused by osteoarthritis. Glucosamine and chondroitin are two supplements that are commonly used for osteoarthritis. Research has not conclusively shown that these supplements are effective in reducing pain or improving function in patients with osteoarthritis. When you are taking any medication or supplement, it is important to let your doctor know so he or she can assess for safety, drug interactions, and any side effects. Losing weight if you are overweight or obese helps prevent osteoarthritis of the knees, reduces the stress on weight-bearing joints, and helps reduce pain in affected joints. Exercise is important to improve joint movement and to strengthen the muscles that surround the joints. Gentle, low-impact exercises, such as swimming or walking on flat surfaces, are recommended, because they are less stressful on your joints. High-impact activity, such as jogging or high-impact aerobics, may increase joint pain. Strength training is also encouraged, particularly for muscles surrounding and supporting affected joints. If you have osteoarthritis, heat or cold treatments may be recommended to provide temporary relief of pain and stiffness. These treatments may be given in the form of a hot shower or bath, or by applying heating pads or cold compresses. Supportive or assistive devices may be helpful to decrease pressure on joints in osteoarthritis. Knee supportsor braces may be helpful for some people to stabilize the ligaments and tendons and decrease pain. Canes may be helpful to take pressure off certain joints. When osteoarthritisis severe, and pain is not controlled with medications or other mentioned treatments, or when the pain prevents you from participating in your normal activities, you may want to consider surgery. There are several surgical procedures that could be used. They include: Arthroscopy to remove or repair loose or damaged tissue in the joint. Joint replacement surgery to replace the damaged joint with an artificial one. Even under the best of circumstances, surgery cannot return the joint to its original state. However, an artificial joint will very likely diminish pain. The two joints most often replaced are the hip joint and the knee joint. Joint fusion (arthrodesis) fuses the two bones on each side of the joint. The joint will no longer be flexible. Osteotomy realigns bones of the arm or leg to relieve pressure on the joint. Talk to your doctor to determine if any of these treatment options are right for you."
250,"Children with ADHD show signs of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity in specific ways. These children: Are in constant motion Squirm and fidget Do not seem to listen Have trouble playing quietly Often talk excessively Interrupt or intrude on others Are easily distracted Do not finish tasks Though your child may have some symptoms that seem like ADHD, it might be something else. That's why you need a doctor to check it out. There is no specific or definitive test for ADHD. Instead, diagnosing is a process that takes several steps and involves gathering a lot of information from multiple sources. You, your child, your child's school, and other caregivers should be involved in assessing your child's behavior. A doctor will also ask what symptoms your child has, how long ago those symptoms started, and how the behavior affects your child and the rest of your family. Doctors diagnose ADHD in children after a child has shown six or more specific symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity on a regular basis for more than 6 months in at least two settings. The doctor will consider how a child's behavior compares with that of other children the same age. A doctor will give your child a physical exam, take a medical history, and may even give him a noninvasive brain scan. Your child's primary care doctor can determine whether your child has ADHD using standard guidelines developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which says the condition may be diagnosed in children ages 4 to 18. Symptoms, though, must begin by age 12. It is very difficult to diagnose ADHD in children younger than 5. That's because many preschool children have some of the symptoms seen in ADHD in various situations. Also, children change very rapidly during the preschool years. In some cases, behavior that looks like ADHD might be caused instead by: A sudden life change (such asdivorce, a death in the family, or moving) Undetected seizures Medical disorders affecting brain function Anxiety Depression Bipolar disorder Doctors may classify symptoms as the following types of ADHD: Hyperactive/impulsive type. Children show both hyperactive and impulsive behavior, but for the most part, they are able to pay attention. Inattentive type. Formerly called attention deficit disorder ( ADD). These children are not overly active. They do not disrupt the classroom or other activities, so their symptoms might not be noticed. Combined type (inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive). Children with this type of ADHD show both categories of symptoms. This is the most common form of ADHD. Treatment plans may include special education programs, psychological intervention, and drug treatment. Learn as much as you can about the options and talk them over with your child's health care provider so you can make the best plan for your child. Studies show that long-term treatment with a combination of medications andbehavioral therapyis much better than just medication treatment, or no specific treatments in managing hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Those kids treated with both ADHD drugs and therapy also had better social skills. A class of drugs called psychostimulants (or sometimes just stimulants) is a highly effective treatment for childhood ADHD. These medicines, including Adderall, Adzenys XR- ODT, Vyvanse, Concerta, Focalin, Daytrana, Ritalin, and Quillivant XR, help children focus their thoughts and ignore distractions. Another treatment used to treat ADHD in kids isnonstimulant medication. These medications include Intuniv, Kapvay, and Strattera. ADHD medicines are available in short-acting (immediate-release), intermediate-acting, and long-acting forms. It may take some time for a doctor to find the best medication, dosage, and schedule for someone with ADHD. ADHD drugs sometimes have side effects, but these tend to happen early in treatment. Usually, side effects are mild and don't last long. Behavioral treatment for children with ADHD includes creating more structure, encouraging routines, and clearly stating expectations of the child. Other forms of ADHD treatment that may benefit your child include: Social skills training. This can help a child with ADHD learn behaviors that will help them develop and maintain social relationships. Support groups and parenting skills training. This includes support for the parents and helping them learn more about ADHD and how to parent a child who has ADHD. No single treatment is the answer for every child with ADHD. Each child's needs and personal history must be carefully considered. For example, a child may have undesirable side effects to a medication, making a particular treatment unacceptable. If a child with ADHD also has anxiety or depression, a treatment combining medication and behavioral therapy might be best. It's important to work with a doctor to find the best solution for your child. Coaching is a relatively new field in the treatment of ADHD in children. ADHD coaches are meant to help children achieve better results in different areas of their lives by setting goals and helping the child find ways to reach them. A child, however, must be mature and motivated enough to work with a coach."
251,"In stage III, the cancer has spread beyond the breast and into nearby lymph nodes. Usually many lymph nodes have cancer cells, or the tumor is so large it grows into the chest wall or skin of the breast. A combination of different treatments often works best. Chemotherapy is a common treatment for stage III breast cancer. Sometimes people have chemo before surgery to shrink a tumor and make it easier to remove. It can help destroy cancer cells that remain after surgery. In cases where surgery isn't an option, chemotherapy may be the main treatment. You can get chemo several different ways. You may take pills or liquids, but often the drugs are put right into your veins. Depending on the type of treatment, it may be given in cycles that allow your body breaks in between. Surgery. You might get a lumpectomy, in which a surgeon removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue from the breast. Or you might need a mastectomy, in which the whole breast is removed. The surgeon would also remove lymph nodes. After a mastectomy, you might choose to get breast reconstruction surgery. Radiation therapy is often recommended for women with stage III following surgery. The treatment can destroy cancer cells that may have been missed. Hormone therapy can help women with hormone receptor-positive cancers. That means the cancer needs hormones to grow. In these women, medications can prevent the tumor from getting the hormone. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women and aromatase inhibitors anastrozole ( Arimidex), exemestane ( Aromasin), and letrozole ( Femara) for postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant ( Faslodex) and toremifene ( Fareston) block hormone receptors and are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. Women who haven't reached menopause may consider having their ovaries removed to stop them from making hormones that help cancer grow. Medications can also stop the ovaries from releasing hormones. Targeted therapy is a newer treatment. About 20% of women with breast cancer have too much of a protein known as HER2, and it makes the cancer spread quickly. Women with HER2-positive cancer may be prescribed ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( Kadcyla), lapatinib ( Tykerb), neratinib ( Nerlynx), pertuzumab ( Perjeta), or trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Along with an aromatase inhibitor or the hormone therapy fulvestrant, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor such as abemaciclib ( Verzenio), palbociclib ( Ibrance) or ribociclb ( Kisqali) is sometimes given in postmenopausal women with certain types of advanced breast cancer. These medications can stop this protein from making the cancer grow and can make chemotherapy more effective. Those who are HER2-negative but have BRCA-mutated breast cancer could be treated by a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that target a protein that helps cancer cells grow. PARP inhibitors include olaparib ( Lynparza) and talazoparib ( Talzenna). Everolimus ( Afinitor) is a targeted therapy sometimes given to women with HER2-negative breast cancer along with the hormone therapy exemestane ( Aromasin). Patients who are HER2-negative but have PIK3 CA-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer could be treated by the new PIK3 inhibitor alpelisib ( Piqray) in combination with fulvestrant. Immunotherapy drugs stimulate your immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. In women with advanced hormone receptor negative and HER2-negative breast cancer the immunotherapy drug atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) is sometimes given in combination with the chemotherapy paclitzxel ( Abraxane). Atezolizumab blocks a protein called PD- L1. Clinical trials are something else to consider. They're open to many women with stage III breast cancer and may give you access to cutting-edge treatments. Talk to your doctor for more information about joining one."
252,"You can find the right oral surgeon with a little research and a little help from the pros. Whether it's searching for someone to fix a broken jaw or someone who will finally get rid of your troublesome wisdom teeth, you can find someone to suit your needs. Your dentist and insurance company can help you find your person. Your first stop should be with your regular dentist, who may have suggested surgery in the first place. He's very likely to have a recommendation. If your dentist recommends an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, he's talking about someone who can treat disease and injuries of the areas around and in your mouth. After he gives you a name, ask him these questions. Why do you recommend this surgeon? What are his specialties? What's this surgeon's background? Would you go to this surgeon? You can find doctors that are in your insurer's network by calling them or visiting their web site. Most companies will list doctors by specialty and show you where their offices are. Make a list, cross-check it with any recommendations you get, and go from there. You can choose out-of-network doctors, too. But that usually costs more. There are more than 9,000 oral surgeons in the United States. So if you don't have a regular dentist who can recommend an oral surgeon, and friends or family can't help you out, take advantage of the web. Lots of sites rate surgeons and their offices. Remember, though, you have to read the patient reviews critically. To one person, someone who's all-business has no bedside manner. To another, that same professional is great because he's all-business. Web sites can also give you background on the doctor, too. Education, experience, professional affiliations, and more are probably at your fingertips. Call your state medical board for more information. Find a specialist who has experience in the surgery you need. Dental implant surgery is different than jaw alignment, also called orthognathic surgery. Many websites can help you get specific. If the doctor's specialties aren't listed -- many will simply say âoral surgeryâ or something generic like that -- do another search. Look for the doctor specifically. See if you can track down a site for the hospital where the doctor works or the doctor's office. These places may list specialties and have a short biography on the doctor. Ask for an introductory appointment. When you meet your prospective surgeon, ask questions like: Is surgery really necessary? What kind of experience do you have? What are some success stories and your failure rates? It's important to look into where your surgery will take place. Make sure the hospital, clinic, or doctor's office is accredited, highly rated, and has experience dealing with surgeries of your type. If you can't find the information online, ask the office for it. Make sure you look for information about the staff and how it cares for patients. It takes a little effort to find the right oral surgeon. But if you do your homework, you'll have a much better chance of finding the doctor who's right for you."
253,"Has extremely dry mouth or no tears Is lethargic Is older and does not urinate in 12 or more hours Isn't alert or able to think clearly Passes out Is too weak or dizzy to stand In young children, mild to moderate dehydration can happen very easily, particularly if the child has diarrhea or is vomiting. Contact your child's pediatrician if your child: Is not drinking enough or eating enough Looks tired Has dark yellow urine or decreased urination Has dry mouth and eyes Is cranky or irritable Vomits more than once Is under 1 year old For dehydration in an infant up to 1 year old: If you breast-feed, nurse more often. If you bottle feed, give your baby the usual amount of fluid, unless the baby is vomiting. If your baby is vomiting, give smaller amounts more frequently. For example, instead of 6 ounces every 4 hours, give 3 ounces every 2 hours. If she vomits more than once, call your doctor. If your baby eats solid food, cereal, strained bananas, and mashed potatoes, also provide fluids. Give an oral rehydration solution such as Pedialyte, if possible. It replaces salt, sugar, potassium, and other nutrients. Ask your doctor what type and quantity to use. For mild dehydration in a child age 1 to 11: Give extra fluids in frequent, small sips, especially if the child is vomiting. Choose clear soup, clear soda, or Pedialyte, if possible. Give popsicles, ice chips, and cereal mixed with milk for added water or fluid. Continue a regular diet. For mild dehydration, have your child rest for 24 hours and keep drinking fluids, even if symptoms get better. Fluid replacement may take up to a day and a half. Continue on your child's regular diet as well. For severe dehydration, the child may need IV fluids in the hospital. If you feel that your child is not improving or is getting worse, see your doctor right away."
254,"If you have dry, irritated eyes, you might head over to the drugstore to pick up some eye drops. Just a quick trip, you think, until you find yourself standing before endless shelves of options. With all the different types out there, does it matter which you choose? Yes, it definitely does. You use different types of drops to treat different problems, like allergies vs. dry eyes. And the wrong ones may make your symptoms worse. For the most part, there are three main types of eye drops: Artificial tears Allergy drops Anti-redness drops Some eye drops might do a combination of things, but if you understand these basic types, you'll know how to choose wisely. You might also notice some natural, homeopathic, or herbal eye drops. Generally, there's just not a lot of evidence about how well these really work. When to use them. Artificial tears are your go-to drops for dry eyes. Their main job is to keep the surface of your eyes nice and moist. What's in them. They try to mimic real tears, but it turns out, that's pretty complicated. So various brands use different mixes of ingredients, such as: Lubricants to keep your eyes moist (all artificial tears will have some) Electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, which can help heal the surface of your eye Guar gum, found in more oily drops. It can be a big help if you get dry eyes because your tears dry up quickly. Preservatives to keep bacteria from growing in the bottle of drops You may need to try different brands to see which one works best for your eyes. Watch out for preservatives. Artificial tears with them can be great because they're often cheaper. But for some people, they can make dry eyes worse. Some people are allergic to preservatives, and others may find that they irritate their eyes. Avoid artificial tears that contain preservatives if: They bother your eyes. Your dry eye is severe. You use drops more than four to six times a day. When you're looking for preservative-free eye drops, note that they don't come in the typical eye drop bottle. You usually find them in single-use vials instead. You snap the lid off, put the drops in, and throw out the vial. They also tend to be more expensive than other kinds. When to use them. These are the drops to reach for when you need relief from itchy, watery, red eyes caused by pet dander, pollen, molds, and other common allergens. What's in them. When your body has an allergic reaction, it releases a bunch of histamines. That's what triggers the runny nose, itchy eyes, and all the rest. The key ingredient in allergy eye drops is a drug called an antihistamine, which blocks histamines from doing their work and prevents allergy symptoms. Some newer allergy eye drops, called mast-cell stabilizers, work by stopping your body from making histamines in the first place. When to use them. Also called decongestant drops, they can help clear the redness out of your eyes. But use with caution. If you put them in for more than a few days, they can irritate your eyes and make the redness even worse. Another problem: If you use them often, your eyes get dependent on them and may get red when you stop using them. Avoid these drops if you have dry eyes. Sometimes, anti-redness drops also have antihistamines in them, which can relieve itchiness from allergies. But again, you're limited in how much you can use them without bothering your eyes. You're typically better off with allergy drops. What's in them. These drops use an ingredient called a vasoconstrictor. It shrinks the blood vessels on the surface of your eye. That makes the redness go away. If you wear contact lenses, it can make choosing eye drops a little harder because not all go well with contacts. When your contacts are dry, try rewetting drops made for your type of contacts. Check with your doctor before you use any other kinds of drops, and avoid those with preservatives. Sometimes, dry, red, or irritated eyes come and go and they're not much of a problem. In other cases, you may have a medical problem that needs more than just drops. See your doctor if you have eye problems that don't go away, even after taking drops for a while. Also, see her if taking drops makes your eye problem worse or affects your vision."
255,"Are you all stuffed up and sneezing away because of a cold? Decongestants and antihistamines can help. They come in different forms, and they're often mixed into combination drugs that you can buy without a prescription. It pays to do a little homework to make sure you're picking the right medicine for your symptoms. They help reduce swelling in the passageways of your nose, which relieves the feeling of pressure and improves the flow of air. You'll be able to breathe a whole lot better. Decongestants come in pill form or nasal sprays. Don't use the sprays for more than 3 days, or you may get more stuffed up. Some types of them can help relieve your runny nose and sneezing when you have a cold. They block a chemical your body makes called histamine that makes the tissues in your nose itch and swell. Most experts say that histamine isn't the major cause of a runny nose when you have a cold. Even so, some of the older antihistamines, such as brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine, can bring relief. Newer antihistamines like fexofenadine ( Allegra) and loratidine ( Claritin) have not been shown to work for cold symptoms. A decongestant called phenylpropanolamine ( PPA) was used for years as an ingredient in many cold drugs to clear up a stuffy nose. In 2000, researchers found it was linked to an increased risk of stroke, especially in women ages 18 to 49. The FDA then banned it from use in all prescription and over-the-counter medications. Today's medicines don't have PPA, but make sure you don't have any old cold meds in your house that might contain the ingredient. The main one for antihistamines is drowsiness, so it can be tough to take during the day. That's why they're often included in nighttime cold medicines. Other common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, and headache. Decongestants may keep you awake and are usually taken during the day. Nasal sprays are less likely to have that side effect and may be helpful at night for congestion. Decongestants can also raise blood pressure. So if your BP is high already, or you've got heart disease, check with your doctor before you use them. He may be able to suggest cold medicines that don't have decongestants in them. There are many over-the-counter decongestants and antihistamines that can help treat your symptoms. They're sold separately or as part of a combo with other cold and pain drugs. If you choose a combination medicine, make sure you know everything that's in it. Check to see if it has acetaminophen. If so, follow the directions on the label carefully, and don't take acetaminophen along with it, because it could cause serious liver damage. These over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants treat cold and allergy symptoms.

256,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL) is a type of blood cancer. Also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute lymphoid leukemia, it is the least common type of leukemia in adults. Here's what you need to know about symptoms, prognosis, survival rates, and treatment for ALL. ALL is a type of leukemia that starts from white blood cells in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of bones. It develops from cells called lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell central to the immune system, or from lymphoblasts, an immature type of lymphocyte. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia invades the blood and can spread throughout the body to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. But it does not normally produce tumors as do many types of cancer. It is an acute type of leukemia, which means it can progress quickly. Without treatment, it can be fatal within a few months. The outlook for acute lymphoblastic leukemia depends on factors such as: Your age: Younger patients tend to have a better outlook. Your lab test results: The prognosis is better if you have a lower white blood count when you're diagnosed. Your subtype of ALL ( B-cell ALL or T-cell ALL) Whether you have a chromosome abnormality called the Philadelphia chromosome; having it suggests a poorer prognosis. Your response to chemotherapy: The prognosis is better if you have no evidence of leukemia four to five weeks after starting treatment. For most people, the cause of ALL is unknown. For this reason, there is no known way to prevent it. However, there are a few known risk factors for this type of leukemia. This means these factors may increase your chances of getting acute lymphoblastic leukemia. But it is not yet known whether these risk factors are actual causes of the disease: Exposure to high levels of radiation to treat other types of cancer Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene, a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke, certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers Infection with human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus-1 ( HTLV-1) in rarer cases outside the U. S., or Epstein- Barr virus ( EBV), a related leukemia more commonly seen in Africa Having an inherited genetic syndrome such as Down syndrome Being white Being male ALL can cause a variety of symptoms. Some of these can be vague and not specific just to leukemia. They include: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite or weight Night sweats Many symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are the result of a shortage of normal blood cells. That's because leukemia cells crowd out these normal cells in the bone marrow. A shortage of red blood cells may cause symptoms of anemia, including: Fatigue or weakness Dizziness Feeling cold Light-headedness Shortness of breath A shortage of normal white blood cells may result in: Fevers Recurring infections A shortage of blood platelets may cause symptoms such as: Lots of bruising for no obvious reason Frequent or severe nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or other unusual bleeding such as from minor cuts Depending upon where leukemia cells are present, other symptoms may include: A full or swollen belly from leukemia cells in the liver or spleen Enlarged lymph nodes such as in the neck or groin, under arms, or above the collarbone Bone or joint pain Headache, trouble with balance, vomiting, seizures, or blurred vision if the cancer has spread to the brain Trouble breathing if spread has occurred in the chest area ALL is really a group of related diseases, or subtypes. Therefore, your treatment options depend upon your subtype and other factors. You may have more than one type of treatment. These include: Chemotherapy, the use of anticancer drugs in combination, generally over a couple of years. Agents used for ALL include: cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan)cytarabine ( Cytosar)daunorubicin ( Cerubidine) or doxorubicin ( Adriamycin)etoposide ( VP-16) L-asparaginace ( Elspar) or PEG- L-asapraginase ( Oncaspar)6-mercaptopurine (6- MP, Purinethol)methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall)methoterate oral ( Xatmep)steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone)teniposide ( Vumonvincristine ( Oncovin) Targeted therapy, drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells and tend to have fewer or less severe side effects than chemotherapy; examples include blinatumomab ( Blincyto), dasatinib ( Sprycel), imatinib ( Gleevec), and nilotinib ( Tasigna), ponatinib ( Iclusig), which attack cells with the Philadelphia chromosome. Radiation therapy, the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; this is not used often for ALL, but may be used to treat leukemia in the brain or bone, for example, or before a stem cell transplant. A bone marrow transplant, which involves use of high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation followed by a transplant of bone-forming stem cells. Stem cells usually come from a donor, or less likely, from your own bone marrow or peripheral blood. If you cannot tolerate high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, lower doses may be used with a ""mini-transplant."" Treatment occurs in two parts -- induction therapy and post-induction therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve remission by: Killing as many leukemia cells as possible Returning blood counts to normal Ridding the body of signs of disease for a long time About eight or nine out of 10 adults achieve remission after treatments, but many relapse, which lowers the overall cure rate to 30% to 40%. So even with remission, post-induction therapy is needed to prevent relapse. It involves cycles of treatment over two to three years. Usually, the drugs are different than the drugs used in induction therapy. The goal is to completely rid the body of leukemia cells that have not been found by common blood or marrow tests. The FDA has approved a form of immune cell gene therapy called CAR T-cell therapy. It uses some of your own immune cells, called T cells, to treat your cancer. Doctors take the cells out of your blood and add new genes to them. The new T cells are better able to find and kill cancer cells. Right now, the drug, called tisagenlecleucel ( Kymirah), is only approved for children and young adults up to age 25 with B-cell ALL who haven't gotten better with other treatments. But scientists are working on a version of CAR T-cell therapy for adults and for other kinds of cancer."
257,"Pain relievers are typically the first drugs recommended by doctors for migraine and headaches. Many of these medications are over-the-counter, or available without a doctor's prescription, while other headache drugs require a prescription. When taking these headache drugs, avoid products that contain caffeine. Any medication containing barbiturates or narcotics should be used sparingly. Note: if symptomatic relief medications are used more than twice a week, you should see your doctor, who may prescribe preventive headache medications. Overuse of symptomatic medications can actually cause more frequent headaches or worsen headache symptoms. Drugs for relief of migraine or headache symptoms include: Generic Name Brand Name Use Precautions Possible Side Effects Acetaminophen Tylenol Pain relief Few side effects if taken as directed, although they may include: changes in blood counts and liver damage Aspirin Bayer, Bufferin, Ecotrin Pain relief Do not use in children younger than age 14 years due to the potential for Reye's syndrome (a life-threatening neurological condition) Heartburn, gastrointestinal bleeding, bronchospasm or constriction that causes narrowing of the airways, anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction), ulcers Fenoprofen Nalfon Prevention of tension headaches; migraines; hormone headaches Nausea, diarrhea, indigestion, dizziness, drowsiness Flurbiprofen Ansaid Prevention of tension headaches; migraines.

But keep the following precautions in mind: Know the active ingredients in each product. Be sure to read the entire label. Do not exceed the recommended dosage on the package. Carefully consider how you use pain relievers and all medications. It is easy to over-medicate yourself. Check with your doctor before taking products containing aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen if: you have a bleeding problem; asthma; recently had surgery or dental surgery or are about to have surgery; have ulcers, kidney or liver disorders; or take any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications ( NSAIDs). Check with your doctor before taking acetaminophen if you have kidney or liver problems."
258,"Gestational diabetes means you have high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Your blood sugar levels were normal before you got pregnant. If you have it, you can still have a healthy baby. Get help from your doctor and take simple steps to manage your blood sugar. After your baby is born, gestational diabetes usually goes away. Gestational diabetes makes you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, but it won't definitely happen. Women with gestational diabetes usually have no symptoms. Most learn they have it during routine pregnancy screening tests. Rarely, especially if the gestational diabetes is out of control, you may notice: Feeling more thirsty Feeling more hungry and eating more A need to pee more During pregnancy, the placenta makes hormones that can lead to a buildup of glucose in your blood. Usually, your pancreas can make enough insulin to handle that. If not, your blood sugar levels will rise and can cause gestational diabetes. It affects between 2% and 10% of pregnancies each year. You are more likely to get gestational diabetes if you: Were overweight before you got pregnant Are African- American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American Have high blood sugar levels, but not high enough to be diabetes Have a family history of diabetes Have had gestational diabetes before Have high blood pressure or other medical complications Have given birth to a large baby before (greater than 9 pounds) Have given birth to a baby that was stillborn or had certain birth defects Are older than 25 Gestational diabetes usually happens in the second half of pregnancy. Your doctor will check to see if you have gestational diabetes between weeks 24 and 28 of your pregnancy. You might get tested sooner if you're at high risk. To test for gestational diabetes, you'll quickly drink a sugary drink. This will raise your blood sugar levels. An hour later, you'll take a blood test to see how your body handled all that sugar. If the results show that your blood sugar is higher than a certain cutoff (anywhere from 130 milligrams per deciliter [mg/d L] or higher), you will need more tests. This means testing your blood sugar while fasting and a longer glucose test over a 3-hour period. If your results are normal but you have a high risk of getting gestational diabetes, you may need a follow-up test later in your pregnancy to make sure you still don't have it. To treat your gestational diabetes, your doctor will ask you to: Check your blood sugar levels four or more times a day. Do urine tests that check for ketones, which mean that your diabetes is not under control Eat a healthy diet that's in line with your doctor's recommendations Make exercise a habit Your doctor will track how much weight you gain and let you know if you need to take insulin or other medicine for your gestational diabetes. For the baby High birth weight Early birth Respiratory distress syndrome Low blood sugar Type 2 diabetes later in life For the mother Higher chance of C-section High blood pressure and preeclampsia Diabetes in a future pregnancy Diabetes later in life To prevent future diabetes or gestational diabetes, get tested for diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after you give birth and every 1 to 3 years after. Take these simple steps to hold off gestational diabetes: Eat healthy, low-sugar diet: Follow a meal plan made for someone with diabetes. Trade sugary snacks like cookies, candy and ice cream for natural sugars like fruits, carrots and raisins. Add vegetables and whole grains and watch portion sizes. Lose excess weight before you get pregnant: Doctors don't recommend you lose weight during pregnancy. Dropping extra pounds before you get pregnant can make for a healthier pregnancy. Exercise throughout pregnancy: Start before you get pregnant if you're planning for a baby. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. Running, walking, swimming and biking are all good options. Get appropriate prenatal care: Not only can your doctor screen you for this condition; she can offer advice on food, activity and weight loss. She can also point you to other health professionals, like nutritionists, that can help."
259,"Because of the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes, you can do a great deal to reduce your chance of developing the disease by slimming down if you are overweight. This is especially true if diabetes runs in your family. In fact, studies have shown that exercise and a healthy diet can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in people with pre-diabetes -- a condition that often develops prior to full-blown type 2 diabetes. The medications metformin ( Glucophage), pioglitazone ( Actos), exenatide ( Byetta, Bydureon), and acarbose ( Precose) have also been shown to be effective in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes in those at risk. In someone who already has diabetes, exercise and a nutritionally balanced diet can greatly limit the effects of both types 1 and 2 diabetes on your body. In diabetics, stopping smoking is one of the best ways to help prevent the damaging effects of diabetes. If you smoke, quit; smoking dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, particularly for people with diabetes."
260,"If you have primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( PPMS), you probably first saw a doctor because your legs were weak or you had trouble walking. Those are the most common symptoms of this type of MS. Once it starts, PPMS gets worse over time. How fast that happens or how much disability it will cause varies a lot, so it's hard to predict. Unlike some other types of MS, you won't have relapses or remissions. Only 10% to 15% of people with multiple sclerosis have this form. Those that do are usually diagnosed later in life than people with other types. It can be hard for doctors to diagnose PPMS. This complex disease is different for everyone who has it. You may have symptoms for a few years, but no major flares, before doctors can tell you're getting worse. This disease mainly affects the nerves in your spinal cord. The main symptoms often involve: Problems walking Weak, stiff legs Trouble with balance Other common symptoms include: Speech or swallowing issues Vision problems Fatigue and pain Bladder and bowel trouble Doctors think MS -- no matter which type you have -- happens when your body attacks itself. This is what's called an autoimmune disease. In MS, your immune system damages myelin, the protective coating around the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. This causes inflammation. But in PPMS, there's little inflammation. Nerve damage is the main problem. Areas of scar tissue (your doctor will call them lesions), form along the damaged nerves in your brain and spinal cord. They can't send and receive signals the way they should. This causes MS symptoms. There is a medication called ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus) that's approved to treat PPMS. It's a first-line medication, which means you don't have to try other therapies before you can take it. It lowers the number of cells in your blood that cause your immune system to go into overdrive and attack the myelin around your nerves. It slows the progress of primary progressive MS. You take it as an infusion into a vein every 6 months. The most common symptoms are itchy skin, rash, sore throat, and a flushed face or fever. You might be more likely to get infections. More serious side effects are rare, but the drug has been linked to cancer, brain infections, and hepatitis B. Your doctor will also focus on helping you manage your symptoms. You'll take medications to help you with: Tight muscles Bladder and bowel problems Pain Fatigue You'll also get rehabilitation, such as physical, occupational, or speech therapy. It can help with: Speech trouble Swallowing problems Daily activities at home and at work It's important to stay healthy overall no matter which type of MS you have. There are no specific eating plans that help with MS, but a nutritious diet is always best. You should also try to stay at a healthy weight. Exercise is also good for all types of MS. It can help you: Stay active and mobile Manage your symptoms Control your weight Exercise can also give you more energy and boost your mood. Try different types of physical activity, such as: Brisk walking, swimming, or other gentle activities that get your heart pumping Exercises to improve your range of motion Stretching and strengthening moves Start slowly. If you're sensitive to temperature, be careful not to get overheated. And never exercise until you're totally exhausted because it will take much longer to recover. No matter which type of MS you have, ask your doctor to refer you to a physical therapist or physiotherapist. He can help you build an exercise program that's right for you. Besides the effects on your body, PPMS can take a toll on how you feel about yourself and the world around you. Given all that you're going to deal with, it's not surprising that half of people with PPMS in one study had major depression at some point after their diagnosis. Sometimes it's caused by the disease itself, or it might be the result of what's been going on in your life. A counselor or other mental health professional can help you work through the emotional struggles of living with MS, like navigating shifting relationships; coming to terms with grief, anger, guilt, worry, and loss; and finding the upside of challenging circumstances. Practice being in the moment and appreciating what you have rather than stressing about what may come. Just knowing you're not alone can make a big difference, too. Support groups can connect you with others who can relate to what you're going through. Check with your MS doctor for recommendations, or try the National MS Society. With the right frame of mind, you can find and thrive in a new normal. Over time, this disease will affect your entire body. You might notice: Both legs are stiff Fuzzy thinking Memory problems You're tired all the time Stiff muscles Numbness or tingling You'll need to be mentally prepared for things you used to do with ease to get harder. Plan ahead -- look into transit options before you can't drive. Find out what your insurance will cover. Be careful of what you drink and schedule bathroom breaks if you have bladder trouble. Thanks to treatment breakthroughs, health care advances, and lifestyle changes, people are living longer than ever with MS. Doctors think the disease may shorten your life by a few years, compared with people who don't have it. The biggest risk isn't from MS, but from complications like heart disease and stroke. But these are easier to prevent with healthier food and more activity."
261,"The relationship between sleep and heart failure is a two-way street. Having heart failure means you're likely to have other health issues, including sleep problems. Likewise, sleep problems, including obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) and insomnia, can make your heart failure symptoms worse. A good night's sleep is important, whether your heart is healthy or not. Rest helps your heart as well as your energy levels, thinking skills, and overall health. If you can deal with your sleep problems, you may ease the burden on your heart. Complications of heart failure can affect your sleep. For example: Chest pain and discomfort make it hard to relax and fall or stay asleep. Lying in bed can make you feel short of breath. You may have to get up during the night to pee. During the day, you're standing and sitting, so extra fluid would normally settle in your legs and feet. But lie down, and it's going to move up into your chest and throat. This can close in your lungs and airway, making it harder to breathe. Your doctor might prescribe diuretics to help get rid of that extra fluid. But these medicines don't stop working when you sleep, which can mean interrupting your slumber for a trip or two to the bathroom. OSA is more common among people who are overweight, but anyone can get it. The tissue in the back of your throat relaxes and blocks your airway while you sleep. You stop breathing, so your brain signals your throat muscles to contract, which opens up your airway again. This can happen dozens or even hundreds of times a night. Your brain also releases stress hormones during these episodes. They can raise your heart rate and your blood pressure -- which raises your chance of developing heart failure or making it worse. Researchers have also found a strong link between trouble falling or staying asleep and the likelihood of heart failure. One reason may be that insomnia triggers the body's stress response, which could weaken your heart over time. Set yourself up for restful sleep: Stick to a regular sleep/wake schedule. Turn off the TV, computer, and other devices before bedtime. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Avoid alcohol before bedtime and caffeine in the afternoon or evening. Exercise every morning. If you have any type of sleep issue, let your cardiologist know. A sleep specialist can help you figure out what's going on medically, whether you're dealing with insomnia or OSA or something else, and how to treat it. One option might be continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) -- a small machine that pumps air through a tube and mask that you wear over your mouth and nose to help keep your airway open at night. There may not always be an easy solution, but sleep is too important to your heart and to your health in general to go without your ZZZs."
262,"Did you know that there are more than 100 types of arthritis? Learn about some of the most common forms, including what they are, what happens, and their symptoms. What is it? More people have this condition than any other form of arthritis. It's the ""wear and tear"" that happens when your joints are overused. It usually happens with age, but it can also come from joint injuries or obesity, which puts extra stress on your joints. Joints that bear weight -- like your knees, hips, feet, and spine -- are the most common places it affects. It often comes on gradually over months or years. It makes the affected joint hurt. But you don't feel sick or have the fatigue that comes with some other types of arthritis. What happens: You lose your body's shock absorber. Cartilage, the slippery material that covers the ends of bones, gradually breaks down. One example is what can happen to your knees when you're overweight. The extra pounds put more pressure on the cartilage as it gets squeezed between the bones. It gets damaged and wears away, so there isn't as much left to cushion the joint. The damaged cartilage makes movement painful. You may hear a grating sound when the roughened cartilage on the surface of the bones rubs together. You may get painful spurs or bumps on the end of the bones, especially on fingers and feet. The joint lining can get inflamed, but it's not common with osteoarthritis. Symptoms depend on which joint or joints are affected. You may have: Deep, aching pain Trouble dressing, combing your hair, gripping things, bending over, squatting, or climbing stairs, depending on which joints are involved Morning stiffness that typically lasts less than 30 minutes Pain when walking Stiffness after resting Your joint may be: Warm to the touch Swollen and harder to move Unable to move through a full range of motion What is it? RA is an autoimmune disease. That means the immune system attacks parts of the body, especially the joints. That leads to inflammation, which can cause severe joint damage if you don't treat it. About 1 out of every 5 people who have rheumatoid arthritis get lumps on their skin called rheumatoid nodules. These often form over joint areas that receive pressure, such as over knuckles, elbows, or heels. What happens: Doctors don't know exactly what causes RA. Some experts believe the immune system becomes ""confused"" after an infection with a bacteria or virus and starts to attack your joints. This battle can spread to other areas of the body. Scientists think two of the body's chemicals that are related to inflammation, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) and interleukin-1, trigger other parts of the immune system in rheumatoid arthritis. Medicines that block TNF, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 can improve the symptoms and prevent joint damage. Symptoms can come on gradually or start suddenly. They're often more severe than with osteoarthritis. The most common include: Pain, stiffness, and swelling in your hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet, jaw, and neck. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects multiple joints. More than one swollen joint. Usually, it's small joints in your wrists, hands, or feet. A symmetrical pattern. When the knuckles on your left hand are inflamed, the knuckles on your right hand probably will be as well. After some time, you may notice more of your joints feel warm or become painful or swollen. Morning stiffness than can last for hours or even most of the day. You may also feel fatigued and notice that your appetite is down and you've lost weight. What is it? People with this condition have inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). Psoriasis causes patchy, raised, red and white areas of inflamed skin with scales. It usually affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the scalp, the navel, and skin around the genital areas or anus. Only about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis will also get psoriatic arthritis. What happens: This type of arthritis usually starts between ages 30 and 50, but it can start as early as childhood. It's equally common among men and women. The skin disease (psoriasis) usually shows up first. Symptoms: Psoriatic arthritis can swell the fingers and toes. People who have it often have fingernails that are pitted or discolored, too. In some people, only one joint or a few joints are affected. For example, you could have it in only one knee. Sometimes, it affects the spine or just the fingers and toes. What is it? A buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint. Most of the time, it's your big toe or another part of your foot. What happens: Often you wake up with a sudden, sharp pain in your big toe after a night of drinking. But drugs, stress, or another illness can also trigger a gout attack. The attack will last between 3 and 10 days, even if you don't treat it. It may be months or years before you have another one, but over time, attacks will grow more frequent. And they may last longer, too. If gout goes untreated too long, it can affect your joints and kidneys. Gout results from one of three things: Your body is making more uric acid. Your kidneys can't process the uric acid your body makes. You're eating too many foods that raise uric acid levels. Symptoms: They almost always come on quickly. You'll notice: Intense joint pain: It'll probably be in your big toe, but it could also be in your ankles, knees, elbows, wrists, or fingers. Discomfort: Even after the sharp pain goes away, your joint will still hurt. Inflammation and redness: The joint will be red, swollen, and tender. Hard to move: Your joint will be stiff. What is it? Lupus (also called SLE or systemic lupus erythematosus) is an autoimmune disease. It can affect your joints and many organs in your body. What happens: Doctors don't know exactly what causes lupus, but something makes your immune system go awry. Instead of attacking viruses and other invaders, it starts to cause inflammation and pain throughout your body, from your joints, to your organs, to your brain. Women of childbearing age are more likely to get lupus than men. It affects African- American women more often than white women. It usually appears between ages 15 and 44. Symptoms: Painful, swollen joints Fatigue Headaches Swelling in the feet, legs, hands, or around the eyes Rashes, including a ""butterfly"" rash across the cheeks Mouth sores Sun sensitivity Hair loss Blue or white fingers or toes when exposed to cold ( Raynaud's phenomenon) Blood disorders, like anemia and low levels of white blood cells or platelets Chest pain from inflammation of the lining of the heart or lungs"
263,"Normally, when bleeding begins, a complex series of chemical events produces a ""plug"" to stop the bleeding; this plug is called a fibrin clot. The fibrin clot is the end-product of many different ""clotting factors"" reacting in the blood. Hemophilia is an inherited condition in which one of these clotting factors (mainly factor VIII or IX) is absent from the blood, so that it does not clot normally. If your health care provider suspects that you have hemophilia, you may be given blood tests to examine how well your blood creates this clot. A lab mixes your blood with specific chemicals in a test tube, to produce a fibrin clot. If such tests are abnormal, other blood tests are done to determine the amounts of factors VIII and IX in the blood. These tests help doctors diagnose the type of hemophilia and its severity. Treatments for hemophilia include: Receiving clotting factors replacement therapy Medication Treatment for joint bleeding and other problems associated with hemophilia The treatments you need will depend on the type of hemophilia and the severity of hemophilia. For instance, if you have mild hemophilia, you may need treatment only when you've been injured or in preparation for surgery. However, if you have severe hemophilia and bleed frequently, you may need regular treatment to help prevent bleeding and help protect your joints from deformity and disability. Clotting Factors for Hemophilia People with hemophilia receive the appropriate clotting factor (factor VIII or factor IX). Factor VIII replacement is used to treat hemophilia A and Factor IX is used in the treatment of hemophilia B. The clotting factor is given intravenously (through a needle in your vein) to stop or prevent bleeding. Factor preparations come from two sources: Donated blood plasma Synthetic ( DNA-derived) Newer types of these clotting factor products have been developed so they can last longer in the body. This means that they do not have to be used as often. Other medicines have also been developed to work with the clotting factors to stop bleeding. Emicizumab-kxwh ( HEMLIBRA) is a medicine that can help prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A. It works by bridging the gap in the clotting factors left by the missing factor VIII. This medication is given as a weekly, under-the-skin (subcutaneous) injection. A health care provider can give the injection, or you can learn to do it yourself. Adynovate is used to replace clotting factor VIII to help prevent and control bleeding in adults and children with hemophilia A. Idelvion, Coagulation Factor IX ( Recombinant), albumin fusion protein is used to help control and prevent bleeding in children and adults with hemophilia B. Delivered by IV, Idelvion can be effective for up to two weeks and is delivered either as needed to prevent bleeding episodes or to manage the frequency of bleeding episodes. A form of clotting factor VIII derived from pigs called Obizur stops bleeding episodes in people with acquired hemophilia A. This rare, dangerous form of the disease is not inherited. Acquired hemophilia A can be related to pregnancy, cancer, or the use of certain medications. However, no cause can be found in about half of the cases. Other Medications for Hemophilia A If you have a mild form of hemophilia, a medication called desmopressin ( DDAVP) can temporarily increase the concentration of factor VIII in your blood. DDAVP can be given intravenously, through an injection, or in the form of nasal spray. Antifibrinolytic medicines such as tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid are oral medicines that are sometimes used with replacement therapy in certain situations to help keep blood clots from breaking down. Treatment for Joint Bleeding and Other Problems Other health issues associated with hemophilia may need to be addressed. The most common include: Treating bleeding joints Monitoring physical activities For bleeding joints, you must get treatment with clotting factor to avoid joint damage. Your doctor may also recommend resting and icing the affected joint to decrease pain and swelling. As pain and swelling subsides, physical therapy may help you recover joint mobility and strength. Monitoring physical activity may be necessary to prevent injury and internal bleeding. Your doctor will discuss the types of physical activities that are appropriate and what kinds of activities may be too dangerous. Your doctor's advice depends on the type and severity of hemophilia. Possible Complications from Hemophilia Treatment Complications from treatment for hemophilia include: Acquiring a blood-borne disease Changes to the immune system that make the treatment less effective Acquiring a blood-borne disease: In the past, people receiving clotting factor from donated blood ran the risk of contracting a blood-borne disease. In fact, in the late 1970s and 1980s, many people with hemophilia acquired viruses such as HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and hepatitis. Now, potential blood donors are carefully screened and all donated blood is tested for viruses. Donated blood is also processed to inactivate any unrecognized viruses. The chance of contracting any disease through treatment is now extremely low. Still, if you have hemophilia it is important for you to receive immunizations for hepatitis A and B to help prevent becoming infected with these viruses. Changes to the immune system: Your immune system may begin to recognize the administered clotting factor as foreign and then destroy it. This makes your treatment ineffective. Your doctor will want to monitor your (or your child's) blood for such a reaction."
264,"Every day, glands in the linings of your nose, throat, airways, stomach, and intestinal tract produce mucus. Your nose alone makes about a quart of it each day. Mucus is a thick, wet substance that moistens these areas and helps trap and destroy foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses before they cause infection. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Normally, you don't notice the mucus from your nose because it mixes with saliva, drips harmlessly down the back of your throat, and you swallow it. When your body produces more mucus than usual or it's thicker than normal, it becomes more noticeable. The excess can come out of the nostrils -- that's a runny nose. When the mucus runs down the back of your nose to your throat, it's called postnasal drip. The excess mucus that triggers it has many possible causes, including: Colds Flu Allergies , also called allergic postnasal drip Sinus infection or sinusitis , which is an inflammation of the sinuses Object stuck in the nose (most common in children) Pregnancy Certain medications , including some for birth control and blood pressure Deviated septum , which is the crooked placement of the wall that separates the two nostrils, or some other problem with the structure of the nose that affects the sinuses Changing weather, cold temperatures, or really dry air Certain foods (for example, spicy foods may trigger mucus flow) Fumes from chemicals, perfumes, cleaning products, smoke, or other irritants Sometimes the problem is not that you're producing too much mucus, but that it's not being cleared away. Swallowing problems can cause a buildup of liquids in the throat, which can feel like postnasal drip. These problems can sometimes occur with age, a blockage, or conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD. Postnasal drip makes you feel like you constantly want to clear your throat. It also can trigger a cough, which often gets worse at night. In fact, postnasal drip is one of the most common causes of a cough that just won't go away. Too much mucus may also make you feel hoarse and give you a sore, scratchy throat. If the mucus plugs up your Eustachian tube, which connects your throat to your middle ear, you could get a painful ear infection. You could also get a sinus infection if those passages are clogged. How you treat postnasal drip depends on what's causing it. Antibiotics can clear up a bacterial infection. However, green or yellow mucus is not proof of a bacterial infection. Colds can also turn the mucus these colors, and they are caused by viruses, which don't respond to antibiotics. Antihistamines and decongestants can often help with postnasal drip caused by sinusitis and viral infections. They can also be effective, along with steroid nasal sprays, for postnasal drip caused by allergies. The older, over-the-counter antihistamines, including diphenhydramine ( Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine ( Chlor- Trimeton), might not be the best choices for postnasal drip. When they dry out mucus, they can actually thicken it. Newer antihistamines like loratadine ( Claritin, Alavert), fexofenadine ( Allegra), cetirizine ( Zyrtec), levocetirizine ( Xyzal), and desloratadine ( Clarinex), may be better options and are less likely to cause drowsiness. It's a good idea to check with your doctor before taking these because all of them can have side effects that range from dizziness to dry mouth. Another option is to thin your mucus. Thick mucus is stickier and more likely to bother you. Keeping it thin helps prevent blockages in the ears and sinuses. A simple way to thin it out is to drink more water. Other methods you can try include: Take a medication such as guaifenesin ( Mucinex). Use saline nasal sprays or irrigation, like a neti pot, to flush mucus, bacteria, allergens, and other irritating things out of the sinuses. Turn on a vaporizer or humidifier to increase the moisture in the air. For centuries, people have treated postnasal drip with all kinds of home remedies. Probably the best known and most loved is hot chicken soup. While it won't cure you, hot soup, or any hot liquid might give you some temporary relief and comfort. It works because the steam from the hot liquid opens up your stuffy nose and throat. It also thins out mucus. And because it's a fluid, the hot soup will help prevent dehydration, which will make you feel better too. A hot, steamy shower might help for the same reason. You can also try propping up your pillows at night so that the mucus doesn't pool or collect in the back of your throat. If you have allergies, here are some other ways to reduce your triggers: Cover your mattresses and pillowcases with dust mite proof covers. Wash all sheets, pillowcases, and mattress covers often in hot water. Use special HEPA air filters in your home. These can remove very fine particles from the air. Dust and vacuum regularly. Call your doctor if the drainage is bad smelling, you have a fever, you're wheezing, or your symptoms are severe or last for 10 days or more. You might have a bacterial infection. Let your doctor know right away if you notice blood in your postnasal drip. If medication doesn't relieve your symptoms, you might need to see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (also called an otolaryngologist) for evaluation. Your doctor might want you to get a CT scan, X-rays, or other tests."
265,"When you're all stuffed up from a cold, you can get fast relief from a nasal spray. But take a minute to learn the different types and how to use them. It can make the difference between success and failure in clearing up that blockage. Your nose will thank you. There are three kinds to choose from: Decongestants. You can buy these over the counter or with a prescription from your doctor. They get rid of your stuffiness by narrowing blood vessels in the lining of your nose, which shrinks swollen tissues. Don't use them for more than 3 days, or your cold symptoms could get worse. Doctors call this the ""rebound effect."" Salt-water solutions. They're also called ""saline"" nasal sprays, and you can buy them without a prescription. They loosen up your mucus and keep it from getting crusty. Since they don't contain any medications, feel free to use them as often you like. Steroid nasal sprays. You can get these over the counter or with a prescription. They're approved to relieve allergy symptoms, but they're sometimes used to help clear a stuffed-up nose that comes from a sinus infection. The first thing you need to do is to blow your nose to clear up the passageways as much as you can. Then take the cap off the bottle and follow the directions for shaking or ""priming"" the pump, if necessary. Now take these steps: Block one nostril by pressing a finger against it lightly. Put your thumb at the bottom of the pump bottle. The hole at the top of the bottle should be underneath your open nostril. Squeeze the pump and breathe in gently. Then switch to the other side and repeat the process. When you're done, don't blow your nose right away and try not to sneeze. That will keep the medication in your nose. Some sprays may have different instructions on the label, so use those or follow your doctor's directions. Don't use it for longer than recommended by your doctor or the maker of the nasal spray. A lot of over-the-counter decongestants, including these sprays, aren't recommended for children. Read the labels carefully and talk to your pediatrician. You might want to avoid some nasal sprays if you have high blood pressure, a heart condition, diabetes, thyroid problems, or urinary problems from an enlarged prostate. Decongestant products, including nasal sprays, can raise blood pressure and pulse rate. They can also cause you to feel nervous or dizzy, or make it hard for you to get to sleep. Some decongestants may interfere with other medications you take. Check with your doctor before you use them. Steroid nasal sprays can cause nosebleeds and, although rarely, a change in your sense of smell."
266,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a long name for an uncommon condition. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is not the same as diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus causes elevated blood sugar levels. But nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is due to a problem in the kidneys. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the kidneys can't respond to a hormone that regulates fluid balance. Excessive urination and thirst are the results. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be challenging to treat. Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems related to a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It's stored in the pituitary gland. Release of ADH is triggered by fluid loss or dehydration. When it's released, it causes the kidneys to retain water. This results in a decrease and concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, enough ADH is produced. But the kidneys are partially or completely blind to it. Typically, the kidneys' ADH sensors are missing or defective. As a result, ADH flows by without effect. The kidneys don't absorb enough water. Instead, they excrete abundant dilute urine as if no ADH were present. The lack of ability by the kidneys to conserve water leads to the symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. They include: Excessive thirst Excessive urine production (polyuria). In some people, these symptoms can become extreme and cause dehydration. Excessive fluid losses can also cause electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms of electrolyte imbalances include: Unexplained weakness Lethargy Muscle pains Irritability For someone without nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the extreme thirst it creates can be hard to understand. Some people need to drink a large glass of liquid every 15 minutes, all day, every day. And since the kidneys aren't holding that water in, that means a lot of bathroom breaks. But why ""insipidus""? People with diabetes insipidus aren't insipid, but their urine is. Insipid can mean dull or lacking flavor. Believe it or not, doctors long ago would taste urine to detect illness. Unlike diabetes mellitus, which results in sweet tasting urine, diabetes insipidus creates watery, flavor-free urine. In infants, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is most commonly caused by an inherited genetic mutation present at birth. As a result, the receptor for ADH doesn't function properly. In adults who develop nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, genetics aren't the cause. Instead, medicines or electrolyte abnormalities cause the condition. Causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in adults include: Lithium, a drug most commonly taken for bipolar disorder; up to 20% of people taking lithium will develop nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Other medicines, including demeclocycline ( Declomycin), ofloxacin ( Floxin), orlistat (alli, Xenical), and others High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) Kidney disease, especially polycystic kidney disease The other form of diabetes insipidus is known as central diabetes insipidus. In central diabetes insipidus, the kidneys function normally, but not enough ADH is produced in the brain. Central diabetes insipidus has similar symptoms to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, central diabetes insipidus can be treated by replacing ADH with a medication called desmopressin. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be difficult to treat. Since the kidneys can't respond to ADH, giving more ADH doesn't help. There's no good way to get the kidneys to respond to the ADH that's there. In fact, treatment options are limited. If a drug like lithium is responsible, switching medicines might improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most adults with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are able to keep up with fluid losses by drinking water. For some people, though, the symptoms of near-constant thirst and urination can become intolerable. Some treatments can reduce the symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, at least somewhat: Diet. A low-salt, low-protein diet reduces urine output. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) like ibuprofen ( Motrin), indomethacin ( Indocin), and naproxen ( Naprosyn) also can reduce urination. Diuretics. It might seem paradoxical, but ""water pills"" like hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride can ease excessive urination from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. All adults and children with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should take frequent bathroom breaks. This helps to avoid over-distending the bladder, which can cause long-term problems, though rarely. The most important treatment for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is to ensure constant access to lots of water. Not keeping up with fluid losses can lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, which can sometimes be severe. Seek medical help if symptoms don't improve after rehydrating, eating fresh fruit, and taking a multivitamin."

268,"You must tell your partner you have genital herpes. If you pick the right time and say it the right way, there's a good chance things will work out OK. Think about how you want your partner to take the news. Do you want it to seem like a huge problem? Of course not, so don't present it that way. If you say, "" I have some awful news for you,"" your partner will likely take it as awful news. Instead, be casual, direct, and unemotional. Also avoid suggesting how he or she should react, especially in the negative. If you say, "" You're going to freak out when you hear this,"" or "" Don't freak out, but...,"" you are setting your partner up to panic either way. Simply say you have genital herpes, and ask if he or she knows what that means. Be prepared to present the facts. Before you tell, learn all you can about genital herpes so you can be prepared to answer any questions your partner may have. Stress that it's very common. Hearing the one-in-five statistic could be a relief. Also explain what it means to have it. Some people get sores on their genitals occasionally, but many others get symptoms so mild they don't even notice them. Choose words wisely. You don't want to load the discussion with negative imagery. Although genital herpes is a disease, saying that you have this ""disease"" conjures up unpleasant images, so avoid using that word. Watch adjectives, too. Don't describe your condition as ""horrible,"" ""disgusting,"" or ""incurable."" In addition to language, the setting can affect the outcome, too. Don't interrupt what your partner is doing to break the news. That is, don't call him or her at work, or barge into a room and say, "" Hey, we have to talk."" That's how you might deliver news of a death in the family or start an argument. The right setting is a relaxing one, just the two of you, where there won't be any distractions. A conversation over a quiet dinner or a walk in the park is preferable to a bowling alley or the supermarket. The worst time to tell, other than after having sex, is during foreplay or when your clothes are already off. That would not only spoil the mood, but it could also annoy your partner. It is usually best to let the topic come up naturally in conversation. That way, it will seem less like a bombshell and more like any other development in your life. For example, you could say, "" Just so you know, my doctor called me yesterday with some test results, and said I have the virus that causes genital herpes."" If you've never slept with the person before, it's not impolite to ask if he or she has any sexually transmitted diseases. You could start the conversation by being the first one to ask. It's possible that he or she might start giving you the same herpes information you had been preparing to give. It's also possible that your partner might take the news badly no matter how well you deliver it. In that case, don't get defensive. Allow him or her some time to think it over in private, calm down, and come to terms with it. It may not be the first challenge you've faced together, and if the relationship is valuable enough to continue, it won't be the last."
269,"You won't always be around to help your child if his asthma flares, especially if it happens at school. So it's important to help him learn how to handle his condition and know the people he can turn to for help. Most schools have several students with asthma. Many classroom teachers -- and certainly school nurses -- know how to help kids with the condition. Still, you can take steps to notify your child's school and make sure that all the key people have what it takes to help him if he needs it. The most important thing is to talk to your child and explain to him as much about asthma as he can understand at his age. Ideally, he should be able to keep track of when it's time to take his medicine and know how to use an inhaler. You should also brief school officials on the details of your child's asthma. They should know how severe his condition is, his triggers, which medications he needs and how to give them, and what to do in case of an asthma attack. Your child should have an asthma action plan that spells out the specific steps for managing his condition. Give a copy of the plan to every school official who may care for your child. You may want to schedule a conference with teachers and other school officials to go over the plan and any other details they should know, including correct inhaler use, location of the inhaler, and signs of trouble breathing Also, look around your child's classroom and other areas he might go at the school to see if there are any known allergy or asthma triggers. If you are aware of any, like dust mites or dust, you should work with the teacher to see if the school can reduce them. Also, it is very important to make sure the school nurse has all the medicines that your child might need during school hours, along with instructions for giving them. Remember that for some inhalers, there's often no way to tell if the device still has medicine in it or not. You will need to keep track of the date when you send the inhaler and replace the medicines at school regularly. The more teachers and other adults at school who know about your child's asthma, the better. He could have an asthma attack in art or music class, in the hallway, or another area where his classroom teacher isn't around. So make sure a few different adults know how to help: Classroom teacher. This is the person who is most likely to be around if your child has an asthma attack at school. The more she knows and the more vigilant she is, the better the chance that your child will get the care he needs. Sometimes, kids who have trouble breathing don't do as well in school, even though they don't have asthma attacks. The teacher should know that your child's symptoms may affect his performance. School nurse. She can give you an idea of what the school policies are for medications and other types of care. If your school shares a nurse with other schools, make an appointment to see her when she's on campus, and find out who will be in charge when she's not around. Other teachers. Talk with the art teacher, music teacher, or any other person who regularly spends time with your child. PE teacher. In addition to spending time with your child like other teachers, the PE teacher should keep an extra eye on your child when he's exercising, since that can trigger asthma. Also, make sure that your child won't be left out because of his condition. The PE teacher should encourage him to participate as long as his symptoms are under control. Office staff and school principal. Counselor. This is an important person to talk to, especially if your child has other issues, such as learning problems, frequent absences, or trouble dealing with other kids. Substitute teachers. You won't always know when there will be a sub, but make sure the regular teacher knows to inform them about your child's asthma. That's why it helps to keep a copy of the asthma action plan in the classroom. Bus driver. Be sure she gets a copy of your child's asthma action plan. The asthma action plan should clearly say what to do if your child is having asthma symptoms that his inhaler can't stop. The school should know when to call your child's doctor and when to call 911. Make sure the action plan has your doctor's phone number, your preferred hospital (emergency room), as well as contact numbers for you, other guardians for your child, and a trusted friend. Most kids can better manage their asthma symptoms if they carry and know how to use their asthma inhalers and other medications at school. At the same time, schools must follow state laws and policies about whether students can carry and use inhalers and other treatments, like epinephrine auto-injectors. If your child's school doesn't usually let kids carry medicine, talk with school officials to figure out what skills he would need to show in order to make that possible. Then work with his doctor to make learning those skills a part of your child's asthma action plan. The doctor can also tell the school whether she recommends letting your child carry and give himself his medicine. Is your child mature enough to carry and give himself an inhaler and other medication at school? Consider the following questions: Does he want to carry and be in charge of his medications? Does your doctor think he's old enough and mature enough? Does your child recognize when he's having symptoms? Does he know the right way to use his medicine when he has symptoms? Can he remember to keep his inhaler with him? Will he promise not to share medication with other students or leave it unattended? Does your child know to tell an adult right after he uses his medication? You may also want to think about: Where and how often he's had sudden asthma attacks before If there are triggers at your child's school How often he's been to the ER or hospital for asthma before Check with school officials about the policy in the district. The goal is for all students to carry and give themselves their medications. Working with your child, his doctor, and the teacher and others, you can come up with a safe, sure way to manage your child's asthma at school."
270,"There are lots of ways to treat allergy trouble, so there's no need to shrug off symptoms like sneezing and itchy eyes. Take action and get relief if you have any signs of these problems. It's one of the most common hay fever symptoms. First, you need to know what your triggers are, so you can avoid them. A board-certified allergist -- a doctor who specializes in treating allergies -- can perform allerge testing. Although it can be hard to completely avoid some triggers, you may be able to cut down on how often you're around them. For example, stay inside when pollen counts are high if that's a source of your allergies. If dogs or cats make you sniffle and you can't just stay away, wash your hands and change your clothes after you play with them. You may want to rinse out the passages of your nose with a Neti pot, too. You can also control your hay fever symptoms with over-the-counter treatments like nasal steroids, antihistamines, decongestants, and cromolyn sodium nasal sprays. Make sure you read and follow the directions on the labels. And don't use decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3 days at a time, because it can make your symptoms worse. Your doctor may prescribe other remedies if these don't help. See him if your symptoms don't get better with over-the counter treatments or you develop other symptoms like fever. Your sinuses are small spaces behind your forehead, cheeks, and eyes. If mucus builds up in these areas because of allergies, you may feel pressure or pain. You can try a few things to help clear up your stuffed-up sinuses. Put a moist, warm cloth on your face, or breathe in steam a few times each day. You can also try oral or nasal decongestants and over the counter pain medicines. Call your doctor if you feel sinus pain and pressure for more than a week. If you can't avoid the allergy trigger that makes you sneeze, or if that doesn't help, try an over-the-counter antihistamine. Read and follow the directions on the label. If you still need more relief, your doctor may prescribe a nasal steroid spray. The best way to stop it is to avoid your allergy trigger. For example, if you're allergic to pollen, keep the windows shut when you're inside, and wear sunglasses outside to help protect your peepers. Try not to rub your eyes, since this can irritate them, and don't wear contact lenses. To soothe the itch, put a cold washcloth over your eyes or use artificial tears. Over-the-counter or prescription allergy meds or eye drops that contain an antihistamine can also help relieve symptoms. If the mucus in your nose gets thick, or if you have more of it than normal, you may get what's called ""postnasal drip."" That's when you can feel mucus dripping from the back of your nose into your throat. It can also feel like a lump in your throat and can lead to pain or irritation there. You can get some relief if you drink extra fluids, use antihistamines, decongestants or use saline nasal spray to thin the mucus."
271,"From the outside, periods can sound amazing. You're born with hundreds of thousands of eggs. After puberty, a gland in your brain sends a monthly message that says, "" Hey! Release an egg!"" to your ovaries. The process happens about 450 times over your lifetime. From the inside, periods don't feel as awesome. For a few days every month, you can feel like a different person, both physically and emotionally. And not in a good way. Don't let those days derail your life. You can still do everything that you would during the rest of the month, if you know how to manage the baggage your monthly visitor may bring. Though it can vary from month to month, periods usually start off with a light flow, get heavier, then taper off. On average, women lose about 2 to 4 tablespoons of blood during each period. In terms of pads or tampons, that means changing them out every 2 hours or more. If you need to change out less than every 2 hours -- or have quarter-size or larger clots -- let your doctor know. Small clots of blood are common. Your body releases anticoagulants to keep the blood from clotting as it moves through your vagina. But on days when you're bleeding or cramping heavily, it may not be released in time. To get the blood out of your uterus, the muscles tighten and relax. That's the sharp ache you feel between your stomach and lower back. Cramps can start before your period and last throughout the bleeding process. If they feel mild, like someone's giving your ovaries a solid squeeze, it's normal. Try an over-the-counter medication for pain relief. If they take your breath away or have you doubled over in pain, check in with your doctor. You love everybody. You can't stand anybody. All at the same time. Hello hormones. Before and during your period, hormones are hard at work moving your body through each phase. When those hormones rise and fall, so does your mood. During PMS and your period, expect to feel everything from crabbiness and anger to feeling more anxious or down than normal. You can't avoid the mood swings that come with your period, but it does help to get good sleep, stay active, and steer clear of caffeine and unhealthy foods to keep the lows from feeling too low. These choices can also cut down on breast tenderness, acne, bloating, and food cravings that come with the menstrual cycle. Your menstrual cycle begins the first day of one period and ends on the first day of the next. The average is 28 days, and anything between 21 and 35 is normal. But it may not always happen like this. Lots of things can affect your cycle, such as stress, illness, body weight, and diet, including eating disorders. It also depends on ovulation, or when your ovaries release an egg about halfway through your cycle. This may not happen every month, especially at first. Tracking your period can help you understand your own personal pattern. Chart out every day for a few months, including symptoms (mood swings, bloating) and when your period starts and ends. Be detailed about your blood flow: is it light, normal, or heavy? A missed period doesn't always mean you're pregnant. It's normal not to have one once in a while, especially if your body is dealing with something big, like stress, sickness, or heavy exercise. If you miss more than one period, and you've taken a pregnancy test to make sure that's not the reason, talk to your doctor. PMS can make you want to eat the house down. But nausea is a normal part of your period. One of the hormones released during your cycle is called prostaglandin. Though most of it sheds with the uterine lining, some gets into your bloodstream. This can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches. Many over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen and naproxen cut down on prostaglandin production and may help ease these symptoms as well."
272,"Eczema can affect many areas of your life, including your job. That's especially true if yours is severe or appears on your hands. The itching, burning, and open, oozing wounds that eczema causes can make it hard to use your hands. During a flare-up, you might not be as productive as you'd like. You may not be able to do all the tasks that you'd normally do. You may also need to take time off while you heal or go to doctor's appointments. If your co-workers aren't familiar with eczema, you may worry about what they think about your skin issues. Your co-workers may not know that eczema is a chronic skin condition that isn't contagious. They might not realize it can cause problems (like pain and bleeding, cracking skin) -- or even that it can show up on areas of your body like your hands. If you're embarrassed or ashamed about your skin or the problems your eczema causes, it can help to have a short conversation with your co-workers. You don't have to tell them everything, but you could say something like, â I have a condition called eczema that can make my skin irritated. You can't catch it.â Don't be afraid to ask others for help when you need it. Flare-ups come and go, and you can do your best to return the favor when you feel better. If you're not familiar with what brings on your eczema, talk to your doctor. She may even test you to find out if you have allergies that cause your eczema. Common eczema triggers include: Regular exposure to water (like washing dishes or frequent hand-washing) Antibacterial products, cleansers, or other products that contain alcohol or solvents. ( There are now some hand sanitizers that are moisturizing.) If you can, avoid triggers while you work. Keep them off your skin. Also try to make sure irritating substances stay off your clothes, other work gear, or your work surface. ( If your work area gets cleaned with these things, you may ask to wash your work area yourself, or wipe it down with plain water afterward.) If you have to come in contact with irritating substances, wear heavy vinyl gloves or neoprene gloves with cotton glove liners underneath. A daily routine is one of the best ways to keep eczema at bay. That can also make getting your job done easier. When you wash your hands, use lukewarm water instead of hot, and only use fragrance-free cleansers. After hand washing, blot your hands dry (instead of scrubbing with a towel or using a heated dryer), and put moisturizer on right after. Bring your moisturizer and your eczema medication with you to work. If your eczema is interfering with your work -- or any other part of your life -- see a dermatologist, a doctor who focuses on skin. She can help you find ways to prevent flare-ups and get the treatment you need."
273,"Household molds can trigger allergy symptoms in allergy sufferers. So avoiding mold can help you avoid eye irritation, congestion, and other allergy-related symptoms. And the best way to avoid mold is to avoid moisture. Keep the house dry -- don't let water build up anywhere, ventilate damp rooms, wipe shower walls and doors after use. Don't leave wet clothes in the washing machine where mold can quickly grow. Wash shower curtains and bathroom tiles regularly with mold-killing products. Don't have too many indoor plants -- especially in the bedroom -- as mold can grow in plant soil. Fix any leaks or seepage in the house, indoors and out. Put plastic over dirt in crawlspaces and keep them well ventilated. Use exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathrooms. Turn off humidifiers if you see condensation on windows. Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners in basements and other areas of the house where mold tends to grow, especially in hot humid climates. Clean dehumidifiers and humidifiers every week. On concrete floors, remove carpet and use area rugs that can be lifted and washed, or install a vapor barrier over the concrete."
274,"Several conditions of the colon can lead to colorectal cancer. What are they and how are they treated? Adenomatous polyps. These types of polyps are more likely than others to become cancerous. During a screening with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, polyps can be seen and removed. The type of polyp can be determined in a lab. Here is how adenomatous colon polyps are treated: A single polyp found during a flexible sigmoidoscopy exam will usually lead to follow-up colonoscopy to look for other polyps. Then, once the colon is ""clean"" of polyps, experts recommend repeat colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years. If follow-up exams continue to be normal, further screening recommendations will be determined by your doctor. Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP). There is continued controversy over how to manage patients with FAP. Almost all untreated patients have colorectal cancer by age 40, therefore some surgical treatment is needed. Here's how FAP is usually managed: Total colectomy with anastomosis of the ileum with the rectum, unless the rectum has polyps. Then follow-up proctoscopy (a scoping test of the rectum) after surgery every 6 months to look for polyps. If a person is unwilling to take the risk of developing cancer in the rectum or already has polyps in the rectum, the rectum can be removed (the risk of developing polyps in an uninvolved rectum ranges from 7.5% to 59%). In these cases, an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery is preferred to maintain quality of life. Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Many people with chronic inflammatory disease of the bowel, such as ulcerative colitis, can be followed with regular colonoscopy to look for signs of colon cancer. If cancer is found, it can be treated appropriately. Some patients elect to undergo prophylactic colectomy possibly with the creation of an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis to preserve some bowel function."
275,"No need to count calories on this plan. You can lose weight with a high-fiber diet made up of the right kinds of fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains. But you have to give up refined sugar and flour and make other tweaks to the way you eat. The plan emphasizes foods with a low glycemic index ( GI), which help keep your blood sugar levels steady. Foods with a higher GI make your blood sugar rise more than those with a lower GI. The foods with the highest GI are carbohydrates, including white bread, white rice, white potatoes, white flour, and sugar. But don't jump to conclusions: Carbs aren't all bad. The book teaches you how to eat the ârightâ carbs, especially whole grains. No major food groups are off-limits, but you'll need to avoid foods with a high GI. Fruits and vegetables: You can eat dozens of fruits and vegetables, but steer clear of a few (like parsnips, watermelon, and pineapple). Grains: Whole-grain bread and pasta, brown rice, and oatmeal are allowed. Protein: You can eat low-fat dairy like milk, cheese, and yogurt; eggs; nuts; fish and shellfish; and many lean meats, including beef and pork. Alcohol: You can have moderate amounts of alcohol, preferably heart-healthy red wine. Sweeteners: Table sugar is forbidden, but artificial sweeteners like Equal, Sweet' N Low, and Nutra Sweet are allowed. Sugar-free ice cream is recommended instead of cookies and cakes. Forbidden foods: You'll have to give up white potatoes, white rice, white bread, white flour, corn, beets, soda, candy, baked goods, and refined sugar. You don't have to count calories or weigh your food, but you do have to watch portion sizes. Limitations: Until you're familiar with the acceptable foods, you may need a copy of the book nearby whenever you're ready to eat or cook. Cooking and shopping: The book has recipes and simple food-preparation tips for grilling fish, assembling sandwiches, and combining healthy foods for meals. Stay away from processed pre-packaged foods, since many contain hidden sugar. Packaged foods or meals: Not required. In-person meetings: No. Exercise: Strongly recommended, although how you choose to stay fit is up to you. Vegetarians or vegans: If you avoid animal products, Sugar Busters! isn't for you. The authors want dieters to eat at least some animal protein. Low-fat diet: You can't follow a typical low-fat, high-carb diet if you're following Sugar Busters! because low-fat foods are often high in refined sugars. The diet requires you to get 30%-40% of calories from fat. But you should eat low-fat dairy products and lean cuts of meat. Low-salt diet: You can try Sugar Busters! if you're on a salt-restricted diet. Too much salt can be bad for your heart, and the authors warn that salt is often added to processed foods. They suggest that you don't need to add salt to your food when cooking. But you'll still need to check the sodium on food labels. Cost: None beyond your shopping. Support: There are no official coaches to motivate you, but there's an online forum on the Sugar Busters! official web site. The authors also tell readers how to form Sugar Busters! support groups. Does It Work? Giving up potatoes, corn, white rice, bread from refined flour, beets, carrots, beer, and refined sugars can certainly lead to weight loss, especially if your usual diet includes lots of these foods and beverages. Sugar Busters! works by cutting calories from added sugars and processed foods, and by adding foods that help you feel full. A diet rich in high-fiber vegetables, stone-ground whole grains, lean meats, fish, healthy fats, low-fat dairy, and fruits are the foundation of most healthy weight loss plans. Testimonials from people who have done the Sugar Busters! Diet are not backed up with scientific evidence, though. Is It Good for Certain Conditions? The diet promises to lower your cholesterol, help you achieve optimal wellness, increase your energy, and help treat diabetes and other diseases. Controlling blood sugars with low-glycemic foods and cutting out sugar and refined grains is a formula that should work for most people with diabetes or insulin resistance. With the restriction of most processed foods, anyone on a low-sodium diet will find this plan helpful. Check with your doctor before starting the diet. The Final Word Sugar Busters! is a template for healthy eating without counting calories or weighing or measuring portions. People who want to curb sugar cravings and clean up their diet will enjoy this adaptable and manageable diet plan. It's ideal for anyone who wants a flexible approach to eating healthy that doesn't include counting calories. It's not for people who eat out often, because avoiding processed foods can be hard at restaurants."
276,"If you have a health problem with your head or neck, your doctor might recommend that you see an otolaryngologist. That's someone who treats issues in your ears, nose, or throat as well as related areas in your head and neck. They're called ENT's for short. In the 19th century, doctors figured out that the ears, nose, and throat are closely connected by a system of tubes and passages. They made special tools to take a closer look at those areas and came up with ways to treat problems. A new medical specialty was born. ENT's can do surgery and treat many different medical conditions. You would see one if you have a problem involving: An ear condition, such as an infection, hearing loss, or trouble with balance Nose and nasal issues like allergies, sinusitis, or growths Throat problems like tonsillitis, difficulty swallowing, and voice issues Sleep trouble like snoring or obstructive sleep apnea, in which your airway is narrow or blocked and it interrupts your breathing while you sleep Infections or tumors (cancerous or not) of your head or neck Some areas of your head are treated by other kinds of doctors. For example, neurologists deal with problems with your brain or nervous system, and ophthalmologists care for your eyes and vision. Otolaryngologists go to 4 years of medical school. They then have at least 5 years of special training. Finally, they need to pass an exam to be certified by the American Board of Otolaryngology. Some also get 1 or 2 years of training in a subspecialty: Allergy: These doctors treat environmental allergies (like pollen or pet dander) with medicine or a series of shots called immunology. They also can help you find out if you have a food allergy. Facial and reconstructive surgery: These doctors do cosmetic surgery like face lifts and nose jobs. They also help people whose looks have been changed by an accident or who were born with issues that need to be fixed. Head and neck: If you have a tumor in your nose, sinuses, mouth, throat, voice box, or upper esophagus, this kind of specialist can help you. Laryngology: These doctors treat diseases and injuries that affect your voice box (larynx) and vocal cords. They also can help diagnose and treat swallowing problems. Otology and neurotology: If you have any kind of issue with your ears, these specialists can help. They treat conditions like infections, hearing loss, dizziness, and ringing or buzzing in your ears (tinnitus). Pediatric ENT: Your child might not be able to tell his doctor what's bothering him. Pediatric ENT's are specially trained to treat youngsters, and they have tools and exam rooms designed to put kids at ease. Common problems include ear infections, tonsillitis, asthma, and allergies. Pediatric ENT's also care for children with birth defects of the head and neck. They also can help figure out if your child has a speech or language problem. Rhinology: These doctors focus on your nose and sinuses. They treat sinusitis, nose bleeds, loss of smell, stuffy nose, and unusual growths. Sleep medicine: Some ENT's specialize in sleep problems that involve your breathing, for instance snoring or sleep apnea. Your doctor may order a sleep study to see if you have trouble breathing at times during the night. Ask your primary care doctor or go to the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery website to find one in your area. Look for one that specializes in your specific problem."
277,"If your child has ADHD, it may be hard for him to control his impulses. He may act before he thinks at home and at school. But there are things you can do to help. Let your child know what behaviors you expect of him. Make simple, clear rules. When he loses control, have set consequences, like time-outs or losing privileges. It's equally important to encourage the behaviors you do want. Keep an eye out for good behavior. When he keeps his impulses in check, reward him. A little praise can go a long way. You could also give him stickers or take him for ice cream. Ask your doctor about counselors in your area who give parent training programs. They'll teach you ways to manage your child's behaviors. Your child spends most of the day at school. Any behavior skills your child learns at the therapist's office or at home need to be reinforced at school. Make teachers your allies. Keep in close touch with all of your child's teachers. Ask frequently how your child is behaving in school. Work with teachers to find solutions for any problems that come up. If you've ever sent your child outside to burn off some energy when he or she was misbehaving, you were on the right track. Studies find that exercise helps control impulses and other behavior problems in kids with ADHD. Think about signing your child up for a sports team, such as basketball, soccer, or baseball. Playing a sport not only gives kids exercise, but it also teaches them important social skills, such as how to follow rules and take turns. Your doctor may recommend medications for your child. They act on the brain chemicals, like dopamine, that can worsen impulsive behavior. It can take some trial and error to find the right medicine and dose to manage your child's impulses, and they may need to be used along with other treatments. It's common to get frustrated when you're raising a child with ADHD. You'll feel more in control if you take an active part in your child's treatment. Learn as much as you can about ADHD and impulsive behaviors. Keep in close contact with your child's doctor, teachers, and therapists. Join a support group to learn from other parents who have been through the same problems. Finally, don't give up. You'll find solutions to your child's impulse problems if you stay consistent and involve a team of teachers, therapists, and other experts."
278,"Colon polyps are growths on the lining of your colon or large intestine, part of your digestive tract. Most of them aren't harmful. But some can turn into colon cancer over time. For that reason, your doctor needs to take out any colon polyps you have. Doctors don't know exactly why they form. Normally, healthy cells grow and divide in a specific way. Polyps may happen when cells grow and divide more than they should. Anyone can get colon polyps, but certain things make you more likely to have them, including if you: Are overweight or obese Are age 50 or older Smoke Have had colon polyps or colon cancer before Have an inflammatory bowel disease, like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Have type 2 diabetes that isn't well-controlled There are also some genetic conditions that raise your chances for polyps and colon cancer, including: Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP). This can cause hundreds or thousands of polyps to grow when you're young, as early as your teenage years. Gardner's syndrome. This is a type of FAP that causes polyps to grow in your colon and small intestine. It may also cause noncancerous tumors in other parts of your body. Lynch syndrome. Also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, it causes you to grow polyps that are very likely to become colon cancer. MYH-associated polyposis ( MAP). A problem with the MYH gene causes many polyps to grow or colon cancer to happen at a young age. Peutz- Jeghers syndrome. The condition starts with freckles that show up all over the body. It also causes colon polyps that can become cancer. Serrated polyposis syndrome. This causes a specific type of polyp, serrated adenomatous polyps, to grow in the upper part of the colon. They can turn into colon cancer. If you have one of these conditions, your doctor will recommend regular screening tests to look for problems early. Not all polyps are the same. There are two main kinds: Hyperplastic. This type is unlikely to become cancer. Adenoma. Most colon cancer starts as this type, though not all adenomas will become harmful. Under a microscope, adenomas look different based on how they grow. Doctors divide them into types based on their growth patterns: Tubular Villous Sessile Serrated In general, the larger an adenoma, the more likely it is to become cancer. Most colon polyps don't cause symptoms. You probably won't know you have one unless a test finds it. If you do show symptoms, you may have: Blood in your poop, in the toilet bowl, or on toilet paper when you wipe. These could be signs of bleeding inside your colon. A bowel movement that's black or has red streaks, which may mean there's blood in it Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week Belly pain Fatigue or shortness of breath. These can be signs that your body doesn't have enough iron, which can happen if polyps bleed. Talk to your doctor if you notice any of these signs. They don't always mean that you have colon polyps or colon cancer. Other things like hemorrhoids, tears in the tissue inside your bottom, or some medicines can cause these symptoms. But it's important to be sure. Different tests can find colon polyps. With some of them, your doctor can remove any polyps during the test. Screening tests for colon polyps include: Colonoscopy. Your doctor uses a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end to look at the inside of your colon. They can remove most polyps as the polyps are found and send them to a lab to find out if they're cancer. Virtual colonoscopy. Also known as a CT colonography, it uses X-rays and a computer to make pictures of your colon from outside of your body. Your doctor can't take polyps out during this test. Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will put a thin tube with a light into your bottom to look at the lower part of your colon. If you have a polyp, he can remove it during the procedure. Stool test. Your doctor will check a sample of your poop for blood. If he sees any, you'll need to have a colonoscopy. Lower gastrointestinal series. Before this test, you drink a chalky liquid called barium, which makes your colon easier to see during an X-ray. During a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, your doctor uses forceps or a wire loop to remove polyps. This is called a polypectomy. If the polyp is too large to take out this way, you may need surgery to remove it. Once it's out, a pathologist tests it for cancer. If you have a genetic condition like familial adenomatous polyposis, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove part or all of your colon and rectum. That's the best way to prevent colon cancer for people with these health problems. If you have colon polyps, there's a good chance you'll get more of them later on. Your doctor will recommend that you have more screening tests in the future. Healthy habits can lower your odds of having colon polyps. For example, you should: Eat a diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and fiber-rich foods like beans, lentils, peas, and high-fiber cereal. Lose weight if you're overweight. Limit red meat, processed meats, and foods that are high in fat. Talk to your doctor about whether calcium and vitamin D supplements are right for you. Some studies suggest they could lower your odds of colon cancer, but others don't. If you have a family history of colon polyps, ask your doctor if you should get genetic counseling and when you should start screening for polyps."
279,"According to the U. S. Surgeon General, about 20% of American children suffer from a diagnosable mental illness during a given year. Further, nearly 5 million American children and adolescents suffer from a serious mental illness (one that significantly interferes with their day-to-day life). Children can suffer from the following mental illnesses: Anxiety disorders: Children with anxiety disorders respond to certain things or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety (nervousness), such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. Disruptive behavior disorders: Children with these disorders tend to defy rules and often are disruptive in structured environments, such as school. Eating disorders: Eating disorders involve intense emotions and attitudes, as well as unusual behaviors, associated with weight and/or food. Elimination disorders: These disorders affect behavior related to the elimination of body wastes (feces and urine). Affective (mood) disorders: These disorders, including depression, involve persistent feelings of sadness and/or rapidly changing moods. Schizophrenia : This is a serious disorder that involves distorted perceptions and thoughts. Tic disorders : These disorders cause a person to perform repeated, sudden, involuntary and often meaningless movements and sounds, called tics. ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder): Children with this disorder are hyperactive and have trouble controlling their impulses and paying attention. ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder in children. Some of these illnesses, such as anxiety disorders, eating disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia, can occur in adults as well as children. Others, such as behavior and development disorders, elimination disorders, and learning and communication disorders, begin in childhood only, although they can continue into adulthood. In rare cases, tic disorders can develop in adults. It is not unusual for a child to have more than one disorder. Children's symptoms vary depending on the type of mental illness, but some of the general symptoms include: Changes in school performance, such as poor grades despite good efforts Abuse of drugs and/or alcohol Inability to cope with daily problems and activities Changes in sleeping and/or eating habits Excessive complaints of physical ailments Defying authority, skipping school, stealing, or damaging property Intense fear of gaining weight Long-lasting negative moods, often accompanied by poor appetite and thoughts of death Frequent outbursts of anger Loss of interest in friends and activities they usually enjoy Significant increase in time spent alone Excessive worrying or anxiety Hyperactivity Persistent nightmares or night terrors Persistent disobedience or aggressive behavior Frequent temper tantrums Hearing voices or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations) The exact cause of most mental illnesses is not known, but research suggests that a combination of factors, including heredity, biology, psychological trauma, and environmental stress, may be involved. Heredity (genetics): Mental illness tends to run in families, which means the likelihood to develop a mental disorder may be passed on from parents to their children. Biology: Some mental disorders have been linked to special chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other. If these chemicals are out of balance or not working properly, messages may not make it through the brain correctly, leading to symptoms. In addition, defects in or injury to certain areas of the brain also have been linked to some mental illnesses. Psychological trauma: Some mental illnesses may be triggered by psychological trauma, such as severe emotional, physical, or sexual abusean important early loss, such as the loss of a parentneglect -- both emotional and physical Environmental stress: Stressful or traumatic events can trigger a mental illness in a person with a vulnerability to a mental disorder. As with adults, mental illnesses in children are diagnosed based on signs and symptoms that suggest a particular disorder. However, this process can be especially challenging with children. Many behaviors that are seen as symptoms of mental disorders, such as shyness, anxiety (nervousness), strange eating habits, and temper tantrums, can occur as a normal part of a child's development. Behaviors become symptoms when they occur very often, last a long time, occur at an unusual age or cause significant disruption to the child's and/or family's ability to function. If symptoms are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose mental disorders, the doctor may use various tests, such as X-rays and blood tests, to rule out physical illness or medication side effects as the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, the child may be referred to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist, mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illness in children and teens. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a child for a mental disorder. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on reports of the child's symptoms and his or her observation of the child's attitude and behavior. The doctor often must rely on reports from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults because children often have trouble explaining their problems or understanding their symptoms. Mental illnesses are like many medical disorders that require ongoing treatment. Although much progress has been made in the treatment of adults with mental disorders, the treatment of children is not as well understood. Experts are still exploring which treatments work best for which conditions in children. For now, many of the treatment options used for children, including many medications, are the same as what is used to treat adults. The most common treatment options used include: Medication: Many mental illnesses can be effectively treated with medications in combination with therapy. The drugs often used to treat mental disorders in children include antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, stimulants, mood stabilizing drugs, and antipsychotics. Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) addresses the emotional response to mental illness. It is a process in which trained mental health professionals help people deal with their illness, often by talking through strategies for understanding and dealing with their symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors. Types of psychotherapy often used with children are supportive, cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, group, and family therapy. Creative therapies: Certain therapies, such as art therapy or play therapy, may be helpful, especially with young children who may have trouble communicating their thoughts and feelings. When treated appropriately and early, many children can fully recover from their mental illness or successfully control their symptoms. While some children become disabled adults because of a chronic or severe disorder, many people who have a mental illness are able to live full and productive lives. It is very important to seek treatment for your child if they are displaying any symptoms of mental illness. Without treatment, many mental disorders can continue into adulthood and lead to problems in all areas of the person's adult life. People with untreated mental disorders are at high risk for many problems, including alcohol or drug abuse, and violent or self-destructive behavior, even suicide. To date, most research on mental illness has centered on mental disorders in adults. However, the mental health community has now begun to focus on mental illness in children. Researchers are looking at childhood development in terms of what is normal and abnormal, trying to understand how factors affecting development can have an impact on mental health. The goal is to try to predict, and ultimately, prevent, developmental problems that could lead to mental illness. A key part of this research is the identification of risk factors -- factors that increase a child's chances of developing a mental disorder. In addition, the mental health community is calling for additional research on medications used to treat children with mental disorders. Most mental illnesses are caused by a combination of factors and cannot be completely prevented. However, if symptoms are recognized and treatment is started early, many of the distressing and disabling effects of a mental illness may be prevented or at least minimized."
280,"ADHD and Tourette's syndrome are two separate conditions, but they have a few things in common. They often start around the same age, and in some cases children can have both conditions. But there are some key differences between them. It's important to get the right diagnosis for your child. The main symptom of Tourette's syndrome is repeated movements or sounds, called tics, that a person can't control. They can be simple, like constant eye blinking, sniffing, grunting, or coughing. They can also be complex, like shoulder shrugging, facial expressions, head movements, or repeating words or phrases. The tics usually happen several times each day. Sometimes, kids with ADHD can have symptoms that seem a lot like tics. They might fidget, squirm, or make random noises if they are being silly. Sometimes kids who take a type of ADHD medicine called stimulants might have tics. The drugs don't cause them, but they may make them noticeable. And they often go away on their own. Signs of both conditions tend to show up around the same age. Symptoms of ADHD can start to appear between ages 3 and 6. Most kids are diagnosed during elementary school. On average, Tourette's syndrome begins around 7 years old. And some children have both conditions. More than 60% of those with Tourette's syndrome also have ADHD. They also may have related conditions, like obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD), learning disorders, and depression. Researchers have found that there may be a genetic link between Tourette's syndrome and disorders like ADHD and OCD. They have a similar biology that makes them more likely to happen together. Tics from Tourette's syndrome are different from the movements or noises that kids with ADHD might make. They almost always involve fast, repeated face or shoulder movements or sounds, which happen the same way each time. Often, kids with ADHD won't have any tic-like movements. Instead, they have trouble staying focused or paying attention. They might be easily distracted or have problems staying organized. Children with Tourette's syndrome often outgrow their tics by their late teens or early adult years -- they happen less often and sometimes disappear altogether. ADHD symptoms often last into adulthood. Also, Tourette's syndrome is rare. The CDC found that about 138,000 kids in the U. S. have been diagnosed with it, while about 6.4 million have ever been diagnosed with ADHD. Researchers believe that genetics have a lot to do with both conditions. But other possible causes of ADHD might include brain injury, low birth weight, or smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Your doctor will be able to tell whether your child's symptoms belong to ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, both, or something else. There's no special test to diagnose either condition. Your doctor will ask about symptoms and when they started. He might do a blood test and medical exam to see if anything else could be causing the problem. Treatment for kids with ADHD often includes a mix of medication and behavior therapy. Stimulants are the drugs that are most commonly prescribed for the condition, but other drugs, like atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine, and antidepressants, can help, too. In behavior therapy for ADHD, kids learn or build on positive behaviors to replace others that cause problems. If your child has Tourette's syndrome, his doctor will likely suggest that he take medication to help with his tics. They might include some types of ADHD medicines, anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs that block the brain chemical dopamine, and Botox shots. Drugs don't get rid of tics completely, but they can help control them. Kids with Tourette's syndrome can also try behavior therapy. One type, called habit reversal, helps them learn to identify that a tic is coming on and then learn a new behavior to do instead. If your child has both ADHD and Tourette's syndrome, his doctor may treat the ADHD first. That may ease stress and improve attention, which can sometimes strengthen a kid's ability to control his tics."
281,"A migraine without aura is more than just a headache. The pain alone is enough to stop you from carrying on your daily activities. And then there's the nausea, maybe vomiting, and more. What makes this headache a migraine? What does it mean to have a migraine without aura? How is this different from other headaches or other migraines? Most important, what can you do to make the migraine go away? A migraine without aura is the most common type of migraine headache. They account for about 75% of all migraines. Another name you might hear is ""common migraine."" It doesn't have the early symptoms, called an aura, that some people have before a migraine begins, like vision changes, dizziness, confusion, feeling prickling skin, and weakness. Scientists aren't sure what causes migraines. They think that many brain chemical such asâ serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and dopamine -- play a role. According to the theory, a wave of nerve cell activity spreads across the brain and excites the trigeminal nerve. This excitation causes the release of a variety of neurotransmitters which caused a change in the size of the blood vessels releasing more neurotransmitters and ultimately causing an inflammatory process and pain. Migraines often run in families, so researchers think there may be a genetic link for the condition. Other things can trigger migraine attacks for some people, like some foods, smells, stress, and things in the environment. Migraines often begin in childhood and get worse through adolescence. Although more boys than girls have migraines, more adult women than adult men have them. But they usually happen less over time. Migraines become rare after age 50. Although painful, a migraine without aura is not life-threatening. Most people feel migraine pain in the front of the head, on one or both sides of the temples. It may throb or be steady. The headache may last from 4 to 72 hours. You might also have any of these other symptoms: Nausea Vomiting Yawning Irritability Low blood pressure Feeling ""hyper"" Sensitivity to light, sounds, or motion Dark circles under your eyes Your doctor will want to be sure that there are no other causes for your headache. So, it's likely she'll do physical and perhaps neurologic exams. She'll also ask you about your health history, including questions like: Do other people in your family have migraines or other kinds of headaches? Do you have any allergies? What is the level of stress in your life? Do you use medications such as birth control pills or vasodilators that could cause headaches? Do you notice that headaches start after coughing or sneezing or after intense exercise? Your doctor may also use some tests to be sure that your headache isn't caused by something else: Blood tests Imaging tests such as X-ray, CT scan, or MRI Tests for infection, bleeding, or other medical problems that could cause similar symptoms Treatment for migraines without aura has two goals: Relieve your symptoms and prevent future attacks. To help relieve migraine symptoms : Stay in a quiet, dark room. Put cold compresses or use pressure on the painful areas. Take pain-relieving medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac ( Toradol), or naproxen. ( Do not use aspirin in anyone under the age of 19) Or take prescription drugs, such as almotriptan ( Axert), eletriptan ( Relpax), frovatriptan ( Frova), naratriptan ( Amerge), rizatriptan ( Maxalt), and sumatriptan ( Alsuma, Imitrex, Onzetra, Sumavel, Zembrace) and , which help narrow blood vessels. Ergots ( Migergot, Cafergot) may also be effective in treating migraine pain. Or take prescription pain relievers. Use medications to treat other migraine symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. To prevent migraines without aura: Medications. If you don't respond to other treatments and you have 4 or more migraine days a month, your doctor may suggest preventive medicines. You take these regularly to reduce the severity or frequency of the headaches. These include seizure medicines, blood pressure medicines (like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers), and some antidepressants. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of preventive medicine that your doctor may recommend if other medicines don't help. Devices: Cefaly is a portable headband-like device sends electrical impulses through the skin of the forehead to stimulate a nerve linked with migraine headaches. You use it once a day for 20 minutes, and when it's on you'll feel a tingling or massaging sensation. Spring TM or e Neura s TMS may be another option. You hold this device at the back of your head at the first sign of a headache, and it gives off a magnetic pulse that stimulates part of the brain. In addition, there is a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator called gamma Core. When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain. Keep a headache diary. It will help you spot anything that might trigger your migraines. Diary entries should include the date and time of your headache, any foods you ate, what you did, and medication you took just before the headache began. It may take 6 to 8 weeks or longer to begin to see patterns and triggers. Avoid common food triggers. Use information from your diary and from trial and error to figure out if any of these foods might be causing your migraines. Chocolate Cheese Red wine or other alcohol Citrus fruits Avocados Bananas Raisins Plums Artificial sweeteners Food preservatives, such as nitrates, nitrites, and monosodium glutamate ( MSG) Ice cream or other cold foods Avoid medication triggers. Many over-the-counter and prescription drugs can bring on migraines. Check with your doctor if you think any of these may lead to your headaches: Cimetidine Estrogen Hydralazine Nifedipine Nitroglycerin Ranitidine Reserpine Never stop taking a medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Relieve mental or emotional triggers. Stress, depression, anxiety, and strong feelings such as grief can trigger migraines. Although you can't always avoid these things, you can learn to control how you handle them. Relaxation, biofeedback, and self-hypnosis techniques can help relieve these sources of stress and prevent migraines, especially in children. Reduce physical triggers. Illnesses, missing meals, and being too tired can all trigger migraines. So can overdoing exercise, motion, and head injuries. Even menstruation can set off migraines. To curb the effect of these things, know how they affect you, keep a regular routine, treat illnesses quickly, and take steps to avoid other physical triggers. Look for environmental triggers. Some people are sensitive to flickering lights, fluorescent lights, changes in air pressure or altitude, or even bold visual patterns. Use your headache diary to spot any possible triggers in your environment -- and then take steps to get rid of them or avoid them."
282,"Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. They can grow anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. Psoriasis usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, psoriasis can cover large parts of the body. The patches can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: Plaques of red skin, often covered with silver-colored scales. These plaques may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed. In severe cases, the plaques will grow and merge, covering large areas. Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, including discoloration and pitting of the nails. The nails may also crumble or detach from the nail bed. Plaques of scales or crust on the scalp. People with psoriasis can also get a type of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis. It causes pain and swelling in the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that between 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis. Other types of psoriasis include: Pustular psoriasis , which causes red and scaly skin with tiny pustules on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Guttate psoriasis , which often starts in childhood or young adulthood, causes small, red spots, mainly on the torso and limbs. Triggers may be respiratory infections, strep throat, tonsillitis, stress, injury to the skin, and taking antimalarial and beta-blocker medications. Inverse psoriasis , which makes bright red, shiny lesions that appear in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Erythrodermic psoriasis , which causes fiery redness of the skin and shedding of scales in sheets. It's triggered by severe sunburn, infections, certain medications, and stopping some kinds of psoriasis treatment. It needs to be treated immediately because it can lead to severe illness. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Psoriasis tends to run in families, but it may be skip generations. For instance, a grandfather and his grandson may be affected, but not the child's mother. Things that can trigger an outbreak of psoriasis include: Cuts, scrapes, or surgery Emotional stress Strep infections Medications, including Blood pressure medications (like beta-blockers) Hydroxychloroquine, antimalarial medication Physical exam. It's usually easy for your doctor to diagnose psoriasis, especially if you have plaques on areas such as your: Scalp Ears Elbows Knees Belly button Nails Your doctor will give you a full physical exam and ask if people in your family have psoriasis. Lab tests. The doctor might do a biopsy -- remove a small piece of skin and test it to make sure you don't have a skin infection. There's no other test to confirm or rule out psoriasis. Luckily, there are many treatments. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) cream or ointment (a strong kind ordered by your doctor. Vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect.) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor shines ultraviolet light on your skin to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate . This drug can cause bone marrow and liver disease as well as lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You will have to get lab tests, perhaps a chest X-ray, and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, lotions, and gels are a class of drugs related to vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. . This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure, so your doctor will closely watch your health while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is overactive in psoriasis) to better control the inflammation from psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia) etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), tildrakizumab ( Ilumya), and ustekinumab ( Stelara). An enzyme inhibitor. The medication apremilast ( Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that blocks a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases. Recent studies have suggested that when you better control the inflammation of psoriasis, your risk of heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases associated with inflammation go down. Psoriasis affects: 2%-3% of people throughout the world About 2.2% of people in the United States Some cultures more than others. Worldwide, psoriasis is most common in northern European and least common in eastern Asia."
283,"A toothache is a pain in or around a tooth that may be caused by: Tooth decay Abscessed tooth Tooth fracture A damaged filling Repetitive motions, such as chewing gum or grinding teeth Infected gums Symptoms of a toothache may include: Tooth pain that may be sharp, throbbing, or constant. In some people, pain results only when pressure is applied to the tooth. Swelling around the tooth Fever or headache Foul-tasting drainage from the infected tooth See your dentist as soon as possible about your toothache if: You have a toothache that lasts longer than 1 or 2 days Your toothache is severe You have a fever, earache, or pain upon opening your mouth wide Proper identification and treatment of dental infections is important to prevent its spread to other parts of the face and skull and possibly even to the bloodstream. To treat your toothache, your dentist will first obtain your medical history and conduct a physical exam. He or she will ask you questions about the pain, such as when the pain started, how severe it is, where the pain is located, what makes the pain worse, and what makes it better. Your dentist will examine your mouth, teeth, gums, jaws, tongue, throat, sinuses, ears, nose, and neck. X-rays may be taken as well as other tests, depending on what your dentist suspects is causing your toothache. Treatment for a toothache depends on the cause. If a cavity is causing the toothache, your dentist will fill the cavity or possibly extract the tooth, if necessary. A root canal might be needed if the cause of the toothache is determined to be an infection of the tooth's nerve. Bacteria that have worked their way into the inner aspects of the tooth cause such an infection. An antibiotic may be prescribed if there is fever or swelling of the jaw. Since most toothaches are the result of tooth decay, following good oral hygiene practices can prevent toothaches. Good oral hygiene practices consist of brushing regularly with a fluoride-containing toothpaste, flossing once daily, rinsing once or twice a day with an antiseptic mouthwash, and seeing your dentist twice a year for professional cleaning. In addition to these practices, eat foods low in sugar and ask your dentist about sealants and fluoride applications."
284,"You have a peptic ulcer if you get open sores in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. That happens when your stomach acids etch away your digestive tract's protective layer of mucus. You may have no symptoms, or you may feel discomfort or burning pain. Peptic ulcers can lead to internal bleeding, which sometimes can mean you'll need blood transfusions in the hospital. You can have two types of peptic ulcer disease: Gastric ulcer. You get this on your stomach lining. Duodenal ulcer. This appears at the top end of the small intestine, an organ that digests and absorbs much of the food you eat. You can have ulcers at any age, but your chances go up as you get older. Ulcers form when digestive juices damage the walls of the stomach or small intestine. If the mucus layer gets too thin or your stomach makes too much acid, your gut will feel it. The two major causes are: Bacteria. It's called Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori), and as many as half of us carry it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts aren't sure how H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing. You may also get it from unclean food and water. Certain pain relievers. If you've been taking aspirin often and for a long time, you're more likely to get a peptic ulcer. The same is true for other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). They include ibuprofen and naproxen. NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such as acetaminophen, won't lead to peptic ulcers. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol also can make you more likely to get ulcers. Stress and eating a lot of spicy food don't cause ulcers, as experts once thought. But they can make ulcers worse and harder to treat. You'll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. You might especially notice it on an empty stomach -- such as between meals or at night. The pain may stop for a little while if you eat or take an antacid, but then return. The pain can last for a few minutes or a few hours, and may come and go for many days or weeks. Other symptoms may include: Bloated feeling Burping Lack of appetite or weight loss Nausea Bloody or dark poop Vomiting Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. But if you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. She'll also check you for bloating in the belly and pain. That may be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have an ulcer is to look. She may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy. This test allows her to pass a thin, bendy tube down your throat and into your stomach and small intestine. The tube has a camera at the end so she can check the lining for ulcers. She may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori. Blood, breath, and stool sample tests also can screen for the bacteria. Some peptic ulcers heal on their own. But if you don't treat them, the ulcers tend to come back. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal."
285,"No one knows the exact reason for irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS), a digestive disorder that affects up to 15% of Americans. It causes belly pain, cramps, and bloating, as well as diarrhea and constipation. The one thing that experts are certain about: Your gender plays a role. Women are about twice as likely to have IBS as men. A growing body of research shows that sex hormones, like estrogen and progesterone, may be the reason. They can trigger IBS symptoms, which may explain why you have more flare-ups at different points of your menstrual cycle. Estrogen and progesterone affect IBS symptoms in a few ways, from how your intestines work to how much pain you feel. Cells in your gut have things called receptors that let these hormones latch on to them. This suggests that your digestive system is designed to sense and react to them. Here are the main ways they affect IBS: Digestion: They control the smooth muscle in your intestines, which dictates how quickly food travels through your system. In one study, animals took longer to empty their intestines when they received a low dose of the hormones than when they got a higher one. This may explain why low levels of sex hormones can lead to constipation. Pain level: These hormones affect how much your cramps bother you. A dip lowers your pain threshold, in part because estrogen boosts the production of serotonin, a feel-good chemical in your brain. A jump in estrogen can reduce some of the ouch factor, so your bellyaches or cramps don't hurt as much. Inflammation: Sex hormones can raise levels of inflammation throughout your body. That makes your IBS symptoms worse. Most research has linked estrogen and progesterone with IBS. But scientists have also found that male sex hormones, like testosterone, may protect against the condition. This may be partly why men are less likely to get the disorder. Because these hormones rise and fall throughout the month, it makes sense that they can affect IBS symptoms. One study found that roughly 40% of women with IBS said it affects their menstrual cycle symptoms. This cycle, which spans roughly 28 days, has four stages: Menses (days 1-5): If you're not pregnant, you shed the lining of your uterus during menstruation. At this stage, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their lowest. Follicular (days 6-14): Estrogen rises, causing the uterine wall to thicken. Ovulation (day 14): The egg is released. Luteal (days 15-28): Progesterone rises to prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If that doesn't happen, your estrogen and progesterone levels drop quickly during the late luteal phase, around days 24 to 28. IBS worsens as hormone levels fall. During the late luteal phase, you're more likely to get bloated and maybe get constipated or have diarrhea. As hormone levels fall to the lowest point during menstruation, symptoms -- like stomach pain, discomfort, and constipation or diarrhea-- become more common and intense. To make matters worse, IBS patients with painful periods, a condition called dysmenorrhea, are twice as likely to have this increase in symptoms. Hormone levels rise when you're expecting, so your IBS symptoms may improve. Some research shows that you're able to handle more pain during pregnancy. This could mean you have fewer cramps and less discomfort. But moms-to-be also tend get constipated more often. Your sex hormone levels also drop with ""the change."" But it's unclear how this affects IBS. In some women IBS improves after menopause, when these hormonal changes stop. On the other hand, more than a third of menopausal women in one recent study reported IBS-type symptoms, like gas and heartburn. Experts say that more research is needed on the topic. How do birth control pills, which give you a steady dose of estrogen and progestin (the man-made form of progesterone), affect your IBS symptoms? So far, research suggests they don't. Scientists have found no difference in symptoms between women with IBS who are on the pill and those who aren't. Both groups saw a drop in the sex hormones before their periods started. Some experts think that continuous birth control -- where hormone levels don't change and you skip periods altogether -- may ease IBS symptoms. We'll need more research to know for sure."
286,"No one really knows what causes asthma. What we do know is that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The causes can vary from person to person. Still, one thing is consistent: Qhen airways come into contact with a trigger, they become inflamed, narrow, and fill with mucus. When you have an asthma attack, your airways narrow and it gets hard to breathe. This can result from spasms of the muscles around the airways, inflammation and swelling of the mucosal membrane that lines them, or high amounts of mucus inside them. You might have shortness of breath, wheeze or cough as your body tries to get rid of mucus. Why do you have asthma and your friend doesn't? No one knows for sure. Allergies play a role for many people as do genetics. If you or a loved one has asthma, it's important to understand what your triggers are. Once you figure that out, you can take steps to avoid them. As a result you'll have fewer and less severe asthma attacks. Some known triggers of asthma attacks include: Allergies Food and Food Additives Exercise Heartburn Smoking Sinusitis Medications Weather Smoke Allergies with asthma is a common problem. Eighty percent of people with asthma have allergies to things in the air, like tree, grass, and weed pollens, mold, animal dander, dust mites, and cockroach droppings. In one study, children with high levels of cockroach poop in their homes were four times more likely to have childhood asthma than children with low levels. An allergy to dust mites is another common asthma trigger. Food allergies can cause mild to severe life-threatening reactions. They rarely cause asthma without other symptoms. If you have food allergies asthma can be part of a severe, life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are: Eggs Cow's milk Peanuts Tree nuts Soy Wheat Fish Shrimp and other shellfish Salads Fresh fruits Food preservatives can trigger isolated asthm, especially sulfite additives, like sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite, which are commonly used in food processing or preparation. For about 80% of people with asthma, a heavy workout can cause airways to narrow. Exercise is often the main asthma trigger. If you have exercise-induced asthma, you will feel chest tightness, cough, and have trouble breathing within the first 5 to 15 minutes of an aerobic workout. For most people these symptoms go away in the next 30 to 60 minutes of exercise. But up to 50% of people with exercise-induced asthma may have another attack 6 to 10 hours later. A slow warm up may help prevent this. Severe heartburn and asthma often go hand-in-hand. Up to 89% of people with asthma also have severe heartburn (you might hear your doctor call it gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD). It usually happens at night when you're lying down. Normally a valve prevents stomach acids from backing up into your esophagus (the tube food goes down when you eat). When you have GERD, this valve doesn't work like it should. Your stomach acids reflux, or back up, into the esophagus. If the acids reach your throat or airways the irritation and inflammation they cause could trigger an asthma attack. Certain clues that suggest reflux as the cause of asthma include the onset of asthma in adulthood, no family history of asthma, no history of allergies or bronchitis, difficult-to-control asthma, or coughing while lying down. If your doctor suspects this problem, they may recommend specific tests to look for it, change your foods, or offer you medications. People who smoke cigarettes are more likely to get asthma. If you smoke with asthma, it may make symptoms like coughing and wheezing worse. Women who smoke during pregnancy increase the risk of wheezing in their babies. Babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy also have worse lung function. If you have asthma and you're a smoker, quitting is the most important step you can take to protect your lungs. Much like asthma causes inflammation in the lining of your airways, sinusitis causes inflammation in the mucus membranes that line your sinuses. This makes the membranes put out more mucus. If you have asthma and your sinuses get inflamed, your airways may too. Prompt treatment of a sinus infection can relieve asthma symptoms. Cold, flu, bronchitis, and sinus can cause an asthma attack. These respiratory infections that trigger asthma can be viral or bacterial. They're a common cause of asthma, especially in children under age 10. You may be more likely to have an attack for up to two months after an upper respiratory infection. Anywhere from 20% to 70% of adults with asthma also have sinus disease. Also, 15% to 56% of people with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or sinusitis also have signs of asthma. People with aspirin-sensitive asthma may also be have trouble with other medications like anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen) and beta-blockers (used to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, and glaucoma). If you know you're sensitive to these drugs, make sure your doctor notes the problem on your chart. Always talk to your pharmacist about this reaction before you start a new medication. Irritants. Tobacco smoke, smoke from wood-burning appliances or fireplaces, strong odors from perfumes, cleaning agents, etc., can all trigger asthma. So can air pollution, workplace dust, or fumes from chemicals Weather. Cold air, changes in temperature, and humidity can cause an attack. Strong emotions. Stress and asthma are often seen together. Anxiety, crying, yelling, stress, anger, or laughing hard can bring on an asthma attack. When you have asthma, your airways are always inflamed and sensitive. They react to a variety of external factors, or triggers. Contact with these triggers is what causes asthma symptoms. You airways tighten and get more inflamed, mucus blocks them, and your symptoms get worse. An asthma attack can start right after exposure to a trigger or several days or even weeks later. Reactions to asthma triggers are different for each person and vary from time to time. Something may bother you, but not your friend with asthma. You might have many triggers while they have none. And while avoiding triggers is a good way to control asthma, the best way is take medications and follow treatments exactly as prescribed by your doctor in your asthma action plan. Figuring out what was going on around you when you had an attack is the first step to identifying your triggers. Your doctor may also do blood testing or ask you to use a device called a peak flow meter. It measures how much air you exhale and how quickly it comes out. It can alert you to changes in your breathing and the onset of asthma symptoms. Ask your asthma doctor if using a peak flow meter would help you narrow down the causes of your asthma."
287,"In many cases, you can safely treat a vaginal yeast infection with an over-the-counter medication. You can also try to treat a yeast infection at home with these tips to ease itching, burning, and other symptoms. Just know the three situations in which you should see a doctor, and then you can get started. It might be OK if your doctor told you in the past that you had a yeast infection and you now have the same symptoms. You need to be sure you have a yeast infection and not something else. There's one other question to ask yourself first. Have you had sex with a new partner? Many of the symptoms of a yeast infection -- itching, burning, and vaginal discharge -- can mimic the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs). If any of these three situations sounds like yours, you need a doctor's attention: It's the first yeast infection you've ever had. See a doctor to be sure it's not a more serious problem that needs a different treatment, such as a urinary tract infection or STI. You're pregnant. Any medications, including over-the-counter vaginal creams, need to be approved by your doctor during pregnancy. You often get yeast infections. If you have four or more yeast infections in a year, doctors call it ârecurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.â If you have it, you'll need treatment for up to 6 months with an antifungal medication. Frequent yeast infections can also be a sign that you have diabetes or another medical condition. If you're concerned about your symptoms or they're different from past yeast infections you've had, you may want to see your doctor for your own peace of mind. Because symptoms are uncomfortable, some women will ask for a prescription-strength vaginal cream to ease the itching and burning more quickly than an over-the-counter product would. Some things you can do to prevent yeast infections may also treat a yeast infection once you have it. Acidophilus. Eating yogurt with live cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus -- a natural, ""friendly"" bacteria -- may head off a yeast infection. Taking supplements with lactobacillus acidophilus may also help prevent them. Watch what you wear. Avoid tight-fitting pants and wear cotton panties to allow your body to ""breathe"" and stay cool. Yeast thrives in a moist, warm environment, so keep things airy and dry to prevent a yeast infection from coming back. Nonprescription treatments. If you're sure you have a yeast infection based on a past episode, you could try an over-the-counter medication to treat your symptoms. These products are usually creams, dissolvable tablets, or suppositories (oval-shaped doses of the medication) that you put into your vagina. If your symptoms do not clear up, follow up with your doctor."
288,"Smoking The incidence of lung cancer is strongly correlated with cigarette smoking, with about 90% of lung cancers arising as a result of tobacco use. The risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked over time; doctors refer to this risk in terms of pack-years of smoking history (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked). For example, a person who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history. While the risk of lung cancer is increased with even a 10 pack-year smoking history, those with 30 pack-year histories or more are considered to have the greatest risk for the development of lung cancer. Among those who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes per day, one in seven will die of lung cancer. But even though the risk is higher the more you smoke, there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. Pipe and cigar smoking can also cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with cigarettes. While someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar smokers have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemical compounds, many of which have been shown to be cancer-causing, or carcinogenic. The two primary carcinogens in tobacco smoke are chemicals known as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The risk of developing lung cancer decreases each year following smoking cessation as normal cells grow and replace damaged cells in the lung. In former smokers, the risk of developing lung cancer begins to approach that of a nonsmoker about 15 years after cessation of smoking. Passive smoking Passive smoking, or the inhalation of secondhand tobacco smoke from other smokers sharing living or working quarters, is also an established risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung cancer when compared with other nonsmokers. An estimated 7,300 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U. S. that are attributable to passive smoking. Asbestos fibers Asbestos fibers are silicate fibers that can persist for a lifetime in lung tissue following exposure to asbestos. The workplace is a common source of exposure to asbestos fibers, as asbestos was widely used in the past for both thermal and acoustic insulation materials. Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries including the Unites States. Both lung cancer and mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in exposed workers. Asbestos workers who do not smoke have a fivefold greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smokers, and those asbestos workers who smoke have a risk that is 50 to 90 times greater than non-smokers. Radon gas Radon gas is a natural, chemically inert gas that is a natural decay product of uranium. It decays to form products that emit a type of ionizing radiation. Radon gas is a known cause of lung cancer, with an estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon gas, or 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer-related deaths annually in the U. S. As with asbestos exposure, concomitant smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure. Radon gas can travel up through soil and enter homes through gaps in the foundation, pipes, drains, or other openings. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that one out of every 15 homes in the U. S. contains dangerous levels of radon gas. Radon gas is invisible and odorless, but can be detected with simple test kits. Familial predisposition While the majority of lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, the fact that not all smokers eventually develop lung cancer suggests that other factors, such as individual genetic susceptibility, may play a role in the causation of lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population. Lung disease The presence of certain diseases of the lung, notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD), is associated with a slightly increased risk (four to six times the risk of a nonsmoker) for the development of lung cancer even after the effects of concomitant cigarette smoking are excluded. Prior history of lung cancer Survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk than the general population of developing a second lung cancer. Survivors of non-small cell lung cancers have an added risk of 1%-2% per year for developing a second lung cancer. In survivors of small cell lung cancers, the risk for development of second cancers approaches 6% per year. Air pollution Air pollution, from vehicles, industry, and power plants, can raise the likelihood of developing lung cancer. Up to 1% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to breathing polluted air, and experts believe that prolonged exposure to highly polluted air can carry a risk similar to that of passive smoking for the development of lung cancer."
289,"Many Americans struggle to control their weight. The country's obesity problem is well known: 1 in 3 of us is obese, and the rate is rising. But you still might wonder what a healthy weight is, and how to get there (and stay there) the right way. It's pretty easy to figure out the estimated healthy weight. You can use two simple tools. The first is called body mass index ( BMI). To figure out your BMI, just use this math formula: Multiply your weight in pounds by 703 and divide it by your height (in inches) squared. So, for example, if you weigh 185 pounds and are 5-foot-5 (65 inches), then your BMI works out this way: 185 x 703 = 130,055 65 x 65 = 4,225 130,005 Ã· 4,225 = 30.78 (round up to 30.8) Obesity in adults is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 or above. The other ranges are: Overweight = 25.0 to 29.9 Normal weight = 18.5 to 24.9 Underweight = under 18.5 BMI is a common tool to give you some idea of where you are. But it doesn't measure body fat. It's not meant to give a diagnosis or tell you for sure that you have a weight problem. For example of how it can be off, muscular people might have a high BMI without being obese. And BMI can underestimate fat in older people and others who have lost muscle. If you think you are obese or have questions about healthy weight, talk to your doctor. There's a second way to get an idea of how close you are to a healthy weight -- just measure your waist. The waist is key because tummy fat can be more serious and put you at a greater risk of things like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Like BMI, measuring your waist doesn't show for sure that you're overweight. They are both common, general screening tools. But in general, here are the guidelines for men and women: A man's waist should be no more than 40 inches If you're a woman who isn't pregnant, it should be no more than 35 inches. Here's how to measure your waist: Stand up and wrap a measuring tape around your waist (just above the hip bones). The tape should be snug but not pressed into your skin. Breathe out before you measure. Doctors have another tool based on the inches around your hips compared with the inches around your waist. To figure out your waist-to-hip ratio: Measure your waist at the thinnest part. Measure your hips at the widest part. Divide the waist by the hips. Men with a waist-to-hip ratio higher than 0.9 have too much of a belly (think apple-shaped). Women with a number higher than 0.85 are carrying too much weight (more like a pear). The waist-to-hip guidelines differ by sex because men tend to carry extra weight in their bellies, while women show it more in the hips and buttocks. Several things help determine a person's weight, including genes and hormones. But being obese usually comes from eating more calories than you use. Your body holds on to extra calories and turns them into fat. So there are two things you must change to lose weight in a healthy and lasting way: Eat right. Americans love fast food, sodas and processed foods. They add up. Move more. Our lifestyles can be short on exercise, playing, or just moving enough to burn the fuel we take in. Your doctor might also want to talk about: Other behavioral changes Medicines Weight-loss surgery If a diet sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The same goes for promises that you'll lose weight fast without changing your diet or exercise habits. A loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is about right. So think âslow and steadyâ to keep the weight off for good. For your diet: Eat more fruits and vegetables. Get good protein and plenty of fiber. Limit salt, sugar, and fat. Be careful with your portions. Talk to your doctor about how many calories you should consume to lose weight. For women it's generally up to 1,500 calories a day; for men it's up to 1,800. You'll need to cut your calories by 500 to 1,000 calories a day to lose that 1-2 pounds per week. For movement: Aim for at least 2.5 hours of aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) every week. You'll likely need even more than that to lose weight. Do some muscle strengthening at least twice a week. Add ordinary movement to that, as well, to burn calories throughout the day. ( Park far from entrances. Take walks around the neighborhood. Get up from your desk and move regularly). Just the word âdietâ sounds like a drag, doesn't it? So don't think about dieting. Think about making better lifestyle choices. Healthy eating and exercise can connect you with family, friends, and others with similar goals. You can join a support group or fitness center, take a class, or play with your kids. Healthy living is a way of life, and the benefits are worth it."
290,"If you have pain below the beltline, you need to find out why you're hurting. Some things might just need a simple treatment. Others might need more serious medical attention. The most common cause of groin pain is a muscle, ligament, or tendon strain. This happens to a lot of men who play sports. The pain may happen right away or build over time. Continuing the sport or activity may make the injury worse. Rest, anti-inflammatory medications (aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen), rehabilitation, and strengthening exercises can often treat the problem successfully. There are other conditions that can cause groin pain. Common ones include: Inguinal hernia: This happens when fat or a loop of your intestine pushes through a weak spot in the muscles of your lower abdomen (belly). You may see a bulge in your groin or scrotum. One quarter of all men will develop this problem sometime during their lifetime. If the intestine or fat gets stuck in the abdominal muscle wall, its blood supply may get cut off. That's called a strangulated hernia. Symptoms can include: Redness or sudden pain near the bulge You can't poop or pass gas Nausea, vomiting, fever Get urgent care if you have any of these symptoms. A strangulated hernia is a life-threatening emergency. The hernia can be fixed with surgery. Prostatitis: This is swelling or infection in your prostate gland. In addition to pain, you may have a hard time peeing. See your doctor. Prostatitis can sometimes go away on its own. But if it's caused by an infection, you may need to take antibiotics. Epididymitis: This is swelling in the tube where sperm is stored -- the epididymis. Most often, an infection causes the problem. Signs and symptoms can include: Pain on one side of the scrotum that comes on slowly. Pain while peeing Fever Milky discharge from your penis Orchitis: It's swelling in one or both testicles. The same infection that's behind epididymitis may cause this problem. The two conditions can happen at the same time. Sometimes, the mumps virus triggers orchitis. It can cause fertility problems. If bacteria is the cause of either condition, an antibiotic can clear it up. Testicular torsion: This happens when a testicle gets twisted inside your scrotum. It may feel like you got kicked in the crotch. It's a medical emergency. The twisting (torsion) cuts off the blood supply to your testicle. If it's not surgically untwisted within a few hours, your testicle can die. It happens most often in teen boys. Testicular cancer: Most of the time, this cancer causes a painless lump in or on your testicle. But sometimes, it's painful. It's not a common cancer. If it's found early, it's almost always treated and cured. Hip problems: Sometimes, hip pain from arthritis or another problem can radiate to your groin. It usually builds slowly and may feel worse when you're driving or sitting in a low chair. Usually, physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications are tried first to treat the problem. You may need an operation if these don't work. Kidney stones: These are small crystals that form in your kidney and can get stuck in tubes leading to your bladder. The pain can be severe. It's usually in your back or belly but can be felt in your scrotum or at the tip of your penis. If the stone is really big, you may need surgery. Kidney infection: This usually happens when an infection travels from your bladder and enters one or both of your kidneys. Symptoms may include groin pain, frequent urination, and blood or pus in your pee. The bacterium called E. coli is often to blame. Kidney infections are treated with antibiotics. The groin pain is very bad or it doesn't get better in a few days There's swelling or a lump around or in your testicle Pain in your side moves into your groin and testicle There's blood in your urine Go to the emergency room if you have sudden or intense pain; the pain radiates to you back, abdomen, or chest; or you have pain along with fever, chills, and nausea."
291,"The spine, or backbone, is made up of a column of 33 bones and tissue extending from the skull to the pelvis. These bones, or vertebrae, enclose and protect a cylinder of nerve tissues known as the spinal cord. Between each one of the vertebra is an intervertebral disk, or band of cartilage serving as a shock absorber between the vertebrae. The types of vertebrae are: Cervical vertebrae: the seven vertebrae forming the upper part of the spine Thoracic vertebrae: the 12 bones between the neck and the lower back Lumbar vertebrae: the five largest and strongest vertebrae located in the lower back between the chest and hips The sacrum and coccyx are the bones at the base of the spine. The sacrum is made up of five vertebrae fused together, while the coccyx (tailbone) is formed from four fused vertebrae. The causes of back pain can be complex. Some causes of back pain include accidents, muscle strains, and sports injuries. In addition to performing a complete history and physical exam for your back pain, your doctor may suggest one of the following diagnostic studies: X-rays, which can be used to provide detail of the bone structures in the spine and to check for instability (such as spondylolisthesis, see below), tumors, and fractures CT scans, which can identify specific conditions, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis MRI scans, which can provide details about the backs' discs and nerve roots. MRI scans are most commonly used for pre-surgical planning A number of other imaging and electrical studies may also be used to identify back problems, and some injections are used for diagnostic purposes as well as for pain relief. Two main types of back injury include: Spondylolisthesis: This is a slipping of vertebra that occurs, in most cases, at the base of the spine. Spondylolysis, which is a defect or fracture of one or both wing-shaped parts of a vertebra, result in this vertebral slipping backward, forward, or over a bone below. Cervical Radiculopathy: Cervical radiculopathy is the damage or disturbance of nerve function that results if one of the nerve roots near the cervical vertebrae is compressed. Damage to nerve roots in the cervical area can cause pain, weakness, and the loss of sensation in the neck, arms, or shoulders, depending on where the damaged roots are located. There are many causes for spondylolithesis. A vertebra might be defective from the time a person is born, or a vertebra may be broken by trauma or a stress fracture. In addition, vertebrae can be broken down by infection or disease. Symptoms of spondylolithesis may include: Lower back pain Muscle tightness and stiffness Pain in the buttocks Pain radiating down the legs (due to pressure on nerve roots) Muscle weakness Spondylolisthesis is treated with the strengthening of supportive abdominal and back muscles through physical therapy. Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ketoprofen ( Frotek), ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil), and naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) may help with pain. Epidural steroid injections may also be effective. For patients who continue to have severe pain and disability despite these treatments, there are options such as decompressive laminectomy, a procedure in which the spinal canal is widened (to provide more room for nerves and a spinal fusion is performed to stabilize the spinal cord), with or without surgical fusion (arthrodesis) of the vertebra, or the use of an implanted device to stabilize the vertebrae in the lower back while permitting more normal movement. In cervical radiculopathy, damage can occur as a result of pressure from material from a ruptured disc, degenerative changes in bones, arthritis, or other injuries that put pressure on the nerve roots. In older people, normal degenerative changes in the discs can cause pressure on nerve roots. In younger people, cervical radiculopathy tends to be the result of a ruptured disc. This disc material then compresses the nerve root, causing pain. The main symptom of cervical radiculopathy is pain that spreads into the arm, neck, chest, and/or shoulders. A person with radiculopathy may experience muscle weakness and/or numbness or tingling in fingers or hands. Other symptoms may include lack of coordination, especially in the hands. Cervical radiculopathy may be treated with a combination of pain medications such as acetaminophen ( Tylenol), or nonsteroidal pain medication such as ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen ( Frotek), naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn), and physical therapy. Steroids may be prescribed either orally or injected epidurally (into the epidural space that surrounds the spinal cord). Physical therapy might include gentle cervical traction and mobilization, exercises, and other modalities to reduce pain. If significant compression on the nerve exists to the extent that motor weakness results, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure."
292,"Almost everyone experiences low back pain every now and then. Whether mild or severe, short-term or long-term, low back pain can greatly affect your daily life. When low back pain strikes, how do you go to work? Take care of your kids? Clean the house? It's not easy, but you can be proactive when it comes to managing your low back pain. Before you take steps to ease low back pain, it's helpful to understand the causes and symptoms of low back pain. Many factors can contribute to low back pain -- from strained muscles to strained ""nerves"" An acute injury -- lifting and twisting a heavy load, for example -- can lead to low back pain. And, over time, aging causes degenerative spinal changes starting as early as the 30s or earlier. Here's a quick overview of low back pain culprits: Overuse of muscles and ligaments, caused by a competitive tennis match or an ambitious day in the garden Disk injury, tears or other damage to the ""shock absorbers"" between the spinal bones (vertebrae) Disk degeneration, the wear and tear, shrinking, and collapse of disks that can be more common with age Degenerative spondylolisthesis, changes to spinal structures, which allows a vertebra to slip forward from the next vertebra Spinal stenosis, narrowing of the space around the spinal cord, which puts pressure on nerve roots Scoliosis, an abnormal curvature of the spine that may cause pain for some people Low back pain symptoms vary greatly from person to person. They are different depending upon the cause of the pain. Your pain may be dull or sharp. It may come and go. And depending upon its source, pain may get worse with standing, sitting, bending, or walking. Pain can even extend into your buttock or leg. Along with this shooting pain may come feelings of numbness, tingling, or weakness down your leg. Called sciatica, these symptoms may be a common result of a herniated disk in the lower back, where the disk bulges out toward the spinal canal. Listen to your body. If a certain movement or exercise causes pain, stop and pay attention. Discuss with your doctor or other health care professional what movements are safe for you to do. Here are a few reminders about what you can do to protect your back: Rest, but not too much. In most cases, it's best to not stay in bed for more than a day or two after an acute injury. If you stay in bed longer than this, your muscles start to lose strength and their ability to support your back. Stay as active as you can, while continuing to listen to your body's signals. Sit and stand safely. What are the positions you're in most of day? Whether at work or home, are you doing everything you can to protect your low back with good posture? You've heard it before, but it bears repeating: Good posture is critical. Sit or stand with your back aligned; imagine a line from your ears through your hips. Try to catch yourself when you're slouching. Here are some other things to remember: Sit and drive as little as possible if back pain is acute. Avoid sitting on soft, low couches. Make sure your work surface is at a comfortable height for you. Use a chair with good lumbar support or use a pillow or rolled-up towel for support. Position your chair at the right height for your task. Rest your feet on a low stool. When getting up from a sitting position, scoot to the edge of your seat, get your feet directly underneath you, and stand. Avoid bending at the waist. When driving, make sure you've got good lumbar support. Position the seat so you maintain a curve in your low back and your hips are lower than your knees. When getting out of the car, support your back: Swing both legs out, don't twist. On long road trips, take regular breaks to walk around for a few minutes. Lift and move safely. Change positions often. If you have a desk job, for example, be sure to get up, move around, and stretch every hour. Gently arch your back. Need a reminder to move? Set an alarm on your phone or computer. When doing activities like cleaning, weeding, or vacuuming, remember to keep the curve in your lower back as much as you can. Whether you're lifting your child or a bag of groceries, use these lifting tips as a guide. Plan the lift and take your time. Get close to the load and test its weight before you lift. If you think it's too awkward or heavy, don't lift it. When the grocery checker asks if you want help to your car, swallow your pride and say yes. Or, at the very least, have the checker pack less in each bag. Put your feet shoulder width apart, tighten your stomach muscles, get a firm grasp, and lift with your legs, not your back. How do you do that? Bend at the knees, instead of your waist. That makes your legs do the work, not your low back. The muscles in your legs are larger and stronger than the muscles of the lower back. As you lift, keep your head in line with your back and don't twist or jerk. Don't sling your toddler up onto your hip! Point your toes in the direction you are moving. Then pivot. As you move, hold the object as close as you can to your body. This takes some stress off your back. When placing a child in a car seat, don't reach from outside the car. Squat and get as close to the seat as you can. If your child is old enough, have him or her climb into the car seat. Avoid smoking. Does it seem like smoking has little to do with your back? You might be surprised. Smoking can contribute to reduced blood flow to your spine and cause it to age faster, putting you at greater risk for low back pain. Eat well and maintain a healthy weight. Maintaining a healthy weight takes some of the strain off your lower back. Also, eating enough calcium and vitamin D helps promote bone strength. What you need for treatment depends on the cause of your low back pain. Your doctor may recommend temporary use of medications to relieve pain. These might include over-the counter medicines such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Sometimes, stronger medications may be prescribed for pain treatment. If pain is severe or lasts, you may need oral or injected steroids. Physical therapy or chiropractic can bring relief for many. These targeted treatments may include: Ice or heat Massage Ultrasound or electrical stimulation A specific program of stretching and strengthening exercises Spinal manipulation A doctor, physical therapist, or other health care professional can guide you in a safe back exercise program. Depending on your medical condition or cause of your back pain, certain exercises or activities may not be safe for you. For many people, gentle low-impact aerobic exercises like walking or swimming about 30 minutes a day can help to keep muscles strong and flexible. These are often combined with specific exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your back. In certain cases where back pain does not get better with nonsurgical treatments, surgery may be an option."
293,"Difficulty breathing or wheezing Tightness in the throat or a feeling that the airways are closing Hoarseness or trouble speaking Swollen lips, tongue, or throat Nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting Fast heartbeat or pulse Anxiety or dizziness Loss of consciousness Other symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) If you have severe allergies, you should keep two epinephrine injection kits with you at all times and readily available. If you experience any sign of anaphylaxis, do not hesitate to use the autoinjector even if those symptoms do not appear to be allergy related. Using the autoinjector as a precaution will not harm you. Call 911 even if you administer the injection. For mild allergy symptoms, such as hay fever or hives, give an over-the-counter ( OTC) antihistamine. For stuffy nose, give an OTC decongestant. For itchy, watery eyes, use OTC allergy eye drops. For itchy allergic rash, apply cold compresses and an OTC hydrocortisone cream. Watch for worsening symptoms, including signs of anaphylaxis. See Severe Allergic Reaction Treatment."
294,"Contact lenses have come a long way and offer some exciting options. You can bat a pair of baby blues one day, then flash golden tiger eyes the next. You can even toss disposable lenses in the trash each night. For people with vision problems, contacts remain an effective, almost invisible tool. The thin plastic lenses fit over your cornea -- the clear, front part of your eye -- to correct vision problems including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. You can wear contacts even if you have presbyopia and need bifocals. Talk to your eye doctor about the best type of lenses for you. Get regular eye exams to keep your peepers healthy and make sure your prescription stays up to date. They're made from a special type of plastic mixed with water. The water content lets oxygen pass through the lens to your cornea. That makes the lenses more comfortable, lessens dry eyes, and helps keep your cornea healthy. If it doesn't get enough oxygen, it can swell, get cloudy, and cause blurry vision or other, more serious problems. Pros. Many soft lenses are disposable, so you can throw them away after using them for a short time. Having a fresh pair of soft contacts means less chance of infection, less cleaning, and more comfort. While soft contact lenses are commonly throwaways, there are some soft lenses that aren't aren't. Depending on what yo need for your eyes, you may wear the same pair for about a year and clean them each night. These are typically more custom-designed contact lenses. Compared with rigid gas-permeable lenses, the other main type of contacts, soft lenses feel better when you first put them in. As a bonus, many soft lenses provide UV protection. Cons. Soft contact lens material can absorb particles, chemicals, bacteria, and mold more easily than both hard and rigid gas-permeable lenses. They soak up all kinds of things that can irritate your eyes -- smoke and sprays in the air and lotion or soap on your hands. Soft contacts are also more fragile. They can rip or tear more easily than hard or gas-permeable lenses. Varieties. New types of soft lenses come to market as new technologies develop. Daily disposables are soft contacts that you wear only for a day and then throw away. That means you don't have to clean them regularly or risk dry eyes and irritation from contact solutions. If you have allergies, they may be the best choice for you. Silicone-based materials create an extremely breathable lens that lets plenty of oxygen pass through to your cornea. They also keep deposits from building up. That means less irritation from dry eyes. Some silicone contacts are FDA-approved for extended wear, so you can use them for up to 30 days. But many eye doctors say to remove any type of contact lens at bedtime. Why? Your cornea gets less oxygen when you sleep in contacts, so the risk of serious complications is higher. Silicone lenses aren't for everyone, so talk with your eye care professional if you're interested in them. They're hip, they're fun, and colored contacts can even be practical. Visibility tint lenses have a tiny bit of color so you can find your lens if you drop it. It isn't enough to affect the color of your eyes. Enhancement tint lenses play up your natural eye color. They're slightly darker than a visibility tint. Color tint lenses are darker, opaque, and change the color of your eyes. Specialty colors include amethyst, violet, and green. Remember, colored contacts are a medical device just like clear lenses. Get them from your eye doctor and nowhere else. Don't share them with anyone. Clean and care for them just as you would any prescription lenses. As the name suggests, these are stiffer than soft contacts. They're made from silicone, and they're designed to let oxygen pass through to your cornea. Pros. You might see better than you do with soft lenses. They correct substantial astigmatism. They're easy to take care of and durable. Cons. At first. the lenses don't feel as comfortable as soft contacts. It takes longer to get used to them, so you need to wear them every day. As you age, the lens in your eye loses the ability to focus from far to near -- a condition called presbyopia. You'll know you have it when it's hard to read up close. If you have trouble with both near and far vision, bifocal lenses can help. They have both your distance prescription and near prescription in one lens. They come in soft and gas-permeable options. You need a professional fitting and evaluation to know which bifocal design is best for your needs. You won't have the same prescription in both eyes. One will have a contact for distance vision, and the other will be for seeing up close. This can take a while to get used to. Each eye works on its own. That makes it harder for them to work together. You might have problems with depth perception. That can make it hard to drive. You might have to adjust your gaze more often to allow one eye or the other to see properly. Another monovision option: Wear a bifocal lens in one eye, and a single-vision lens in the other. This makes driving easier. One more option: Get your contact prescription for distance vision. Wear reading glasses over your contacts when you need to see up close. If you have astigmatism and want to wear contacts, you'll need a toric lens. They're made from the same material as other contacts but work with your eyeball, which isn't completely round. They come in soft or rigid gas-permeable forms, extended wear, daily disposable, and even in colored lenses. Like bifocal lenses in a pair of glasses, toric lenses have two powers in one lens: one that corrects your astigmatism, and another for nearsightedness or farsightedness. If you're mildly nearsighted, your eye doctor may suggest orthokeratology, or ortho-k for short. She'll use a special contact lens to reshape your cornea -- and improve your vision. But the results only last while you have the contact in. This procedure isn't widely used, because laser vision correction offers the same result in less time and is permanent. Laser surgery is now OK for professionals -- like members of the military or airline pilots -- whose jobs didn't allow them to have it in the past. If you can't have laser surgery, ask your eye care professional if ortho-k could work for you."
295,"The symptoms of heart failure can be related to the pooling of fluid in the body or can be secondary to decreased blood flow to the body. Some people with heart failure don't experience symptoms, but here are some of the more common signs: Shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest or when lying down Swollen legs, ankles, or abdomen Dry, hacking cough, or wheezing Other symptoms may include: Fatigue, palpitations, or pain during normal activities Weight gain from fluid retention Increased need to urinate during the night Dizziness or confusion Rapid or irregular heartbeats Your legs, ankles, or abdomen are swollen You have difficulty breathing, especially if you wake up short of breath, or you cannot lie down flat without getting short of breath You gain 2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week You have a feeling of fullness (bloating) in your stomach with a loss of appetite or nausea You feel extreme fatigue or decreased ability to complete daily activities You have a respiratory infection or a cough that has become worse Your heart rate is fast, above 100 beats per minute You experience a new irregular heart beat You feel chest pain or discomfort during activity that is relieved with rest You notice changes in sleep patterns, including difficulty sleeping or lying flat in bed, or needing to sleep a lot more than usual You urinate less You feel restless or confused You suffer constant dizziness or lightheadedness You have nausea or poor appetite"
296,"When it comes to fibromyalgia treatments, there are drugs, alternative remedies, and lifestyle habits that may help decrease pain and improve sleep. Your fibromyalgia specialist may prescribe pain medication or antidepressants to help treat the pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety that comes with the disease. In addition, your doctor may recommend physical therapy, moist heat, regular aerobic exercise, relaxation, and stress reduction to help you self-manage your symptoms. There is no one ""pill"" that treats or cures fibromyalgia. A multidisciplinary approach that uses both medication and alternative or lifestyle strategies seems to work best to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. Fibromyalgia can cause symptoms similar to arthritis, bursitis, and tendinitis. Consequently, some experts group fibromyalgia with arthritis and related disorders. The pain associated with these other conditions is typically localized to a single area, while the pain and stiffness of fibromyalgia are very widespread and consists of deep muscle pain, morning stiffness, and painful tender points, making it difficult to exercise or be physically active. For in depth information, see Web MD's Fibromyalgia Pain. Along with deep muscle pain and painful tender points, fatigue is a key symptom of fibromyalgia and it can be debilitating. Not only do you feel exhausted and weak, but bed rest does not seem to help. Many people with fibromyalgia report sleeping eight to 10 hours at night and feeling as if they haven't slept at all. Some drugs may help ease the fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. In addition, aerobic exercise can help ease fatigue, minimize pain, improve quality of sleep, and improve mood. For in depth information, see Web MD's Fibromyalgia and Fatigue. Numerous studies show that exercise is one of the most important treatments for fibromyalgia. Many people with fibromyalgia are not physically fit. They avoid exercise because they fear increased pain. Yet aerobic or conditioning exercise can actually help relieve pain and depression. Regular exercise increases the body's production of endorphins, natural painkillers that also boost mood. Starting slowly and gradually increasing the duration and intensity of exercise can help you enjoy the benefits of exercise without feeling more pain. For in depth information, see Web MD's Fibromyalgia and Exercise. Physical therapy can help relieve fibromyalgia pain and stiffness. Regular visits to a licensed physical therapist can increase confidence with exercise, help relax tense muscles, and teach you more about your body and movement. In addition, physical therapy helps with ânew' muscle memory and neuroendocrine changes in a positive way to help you muscles recover. Your physical therapist will show you the proper way to stretch painful muscles to get optimal relief. In addition, using hydrotherapy (moist heat or ice packs) along with physical therapy may ease pain even more. Physical therapy can enable you to regain control of your illness. That's because you can focus on lifestyle changes rather than on the chronic dysfunction. Proper posture, which your physical therapist will help you with, allows efficient muscle function. That way, you can avoid undue fatigue and pain. For in depth information, see Web MD's Fibromyalgia and Physical Therapy. Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline ( Elavil) are sometimes prescribed to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. These medications may affect multiple symptoms â pain, fatigue, depressed mood, and sleep disturbances. The anticonvulsant drug pregabalin ( Lyrica) has been approved by the FDA for fibromyalgia. Lyrica reduces pain and improves daily function for some people. The drug's most common side effects include mild to moderate dizziness and sleepiness. Lyrica can also cause swelling and weight gain. The FDA advises patients to talk to their doctor about whether the use of Lyrica may impair their ability to drive. Other anticonvulsants are sometimes used to treat fibromyalgia. Duloxetine ( Cymbalta), an antidepressant, is another drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Cymbalta is an antidepressant that belongs to a class of drugs called serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs). Besides fibromyalgia and depression, Cymbalta is also approved to treat generalized anxiety disorder and diabetic nerve pain in adults. Cymbalta's most common side effects include nausea, dry mouth, and constipation. It can also cause insomnia and dizziness. The FDA has also approved milnacipran ( Savella) for treating fibromyalgia. Savella -- like Cymbalta -- is in the class of drugs known as SNRIs. But while it acts in the body the same way certain antidepressants do, Savella is not used to treat depression. When used to treat fibromyalgia, Savella has been shown to reduce pain, improve physical function, and bring about overall fibromyalgia improvement for some people. The most common side effect of Savella is nausea. Other side effects include headache, constipation, dizziness, and insomnia. Medications that increase restful sleep may help treat fibromyalgia symptoms. These drugs include low doses of antidepressant medication such as amitriptyline taken before bedtime. Other kinds of sleeping pills are often not very helpful for people who have fibromyalgia. Anti-inflammatory drugs -- including ibuprofen and naproxen -- are not particularly helpful since there is little to no inflammation with fibromyalgia. However, they may help boost pain relief from other fibromyalgia medications. Anti-inflammatory drugs have many side effects, such as stomach upset and bleeding and may increase blood pressure. The pain reliever acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) may be helpful, and it is easier on the stomach and less likely to cause drug interactions than anti-inflammatory drugs. However, acetaminophen should only be taken as recommended. Too much acetaminophen can lead to liver problems. Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril), may provide some relief of muscle pain, especially when taken at bedtime. Steroids (such as prednisone) used to treat inflammation associated with other rheumatic conditions have been tested in people with fibromyalgia and did not appear to improve symptoms. However, a steroid injection directly into a muscle spasm (trigger point) may sometimes be used when other treatments have failed. In addition to medication, other treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help develop a sense of self-control and provide education about your condition. With talk therapy, you can learn new self-management strategies that can boost coping skills, particularly in managing symptoms. For in depth information, see Web MD's Fibromyalgia Medications. With fibromyalgia pain being so debilitating, you may wonder about the effectiveness of alternative treatments to ease your discomfort. Some people with the chronic pain of fibromyalgia do find good relief with alternative treatments, including the following: Acupuncture . Some findings show that acupuncture may alter brain chemistry and help increase pain tolerance. Chiropractic . Chiropractic may improve pain levels, ease low back pain, and increase cervical and lumbar ranges of motion. Massage . Massage may stimulate circulation and release chronic patterns of muscular tension.. Biofeedback. Using electronics to measure stress-related responses in the body, biofeedback helps some people control the stress response and relieves chronic pain, according to the National Institutes of Health. Meditation . Studies show that meditation produces brain waves consistent with serenity and happiness, which may help to relieve anxiety. Tai Chi and qi gong. These are two Chinese practices that have been found to be helpful with some fibromyalgia symptoms including pain, sleep troubles, and depression in some patients. Herbals and dietary supplements . While the studies are limited on natural dietary supplements and fibromyalgia, some patients have found relief with over-the-counter natural dietary supplements such as 5- HTP, melatonin, alpha hydroxy, L-carnitine, SAM-e, and probiotics. Many of these have drug interactions, so avoid these if you are on any prescription medications or on other supplements. Some may not be safe for you if you have other medical problems. In addition, people with fibromyalgia often wonder if medical marijuana, which can be prescribed by physicians in some states, can help their chronic pain and fatigue. While medical marijuana doesn't cure diseases like fibromyalgia, some pain experts say it may work against pain, help people sleep better, and improve mood. Other pain specialists see no role for medical marijuana in pain management and express concern that people don't know what they're getting when they buy it."" Talk to your doctor before trying any alternative or complementary treatments. To learn more about alternative treatments for fibromyalgia, see Web MD's Fibromyalgia and Alternative Treatment. Also see Web MD's Fibromyalgia and Medical Marijuana. As with many conditions, people with fibromyalgia often have good days and bad. With proper fibromyalgia treatment, including regular exercise, most people have good symptom relief. However, typically the pain will come back, especially when life is stressful. Over time, you will learn what helps you work through these painful episodes and how to help prevent them. People who continue to stay active socially as well as physically, despite their pain, often end up doing best."

The legal process is also tricky because it varies from state to state. Even so, whether it's because of fertility problems or other reasons, surrogacy is an option for you and your partner. Find out how it works and see if it's right for you. There are two kinds: Traditional surrogate. It's a woman who gets artificially inseminated with the father's sperm. She then carries the baby and delivers it for you and your partner to raise. A traditional surrogate is the baby's biological mother. That's because it was her egg that was fertilized by the father's sperm. Donor sperm can also be used. Gestational surrogates. A technique called ""in vitro fertilization"" ( IVF) now makes it possible to gather eggs from the mother, fertilize them with sperm from the father, and place the embryo into the uterus of a gestational surrogate. The surrogate then carries the baby until birth. She doesn't have any genetic ties to the child because it wasn't her egg that was used. A gestational surrogate is called the ""birth mother."" The biological mother, though, is still the woman whose egg was fertilized. In the U. S., gestational surrogacy is less complex legally. That's because both intended parents have genetic ties to the baby. As a result, gestational surrogacy has become more common than a traditional surrogate. About 750 babies are born each year using gestational surrogacy. If you're a woman, you may consider a surrogate for several reasons: Medical problems with your uterus You had a hysterectomy that removed your uterus Conditions that make pregnancy impossible or risky for you, such as severe heart disease You may want to think about surrogacy if you tried but couldn't get pregnant with a variety of assisted-reproduction techniques, such as IVF. Surrogates have also made parenthood an option for people who might not be able to adopt a child, perhaps because of their age or marital status. If gay men decide to use a traditional surrogate, one of them uses his sperm to fertilize the surrogate's egg through artificial insemination. The surrogate then carries the baby and gives birth. A gay couple might also choose an egg donor, fertilize that donated egg, and then have the embryo implanted in a gestational surrogate to carry until birth. There are several ways you can find a surrogate mother: Friends or family. Sometimes you can ask a friend or relative to be a surrogate for you. It's somewhat controversial. But because of the high cost of surrogacy and the complex legal issues it raises about parental rights, a tried-and-tested family relationship can be simpler to manage. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine accepts certain family ties as acceptable for surrogates. It generally discourages surrogacy, though, if the child would carry the same genes as a child born of incest between close relatives. A surrogacy agency. Most people use one to arrange a gestational surrogate. There are about 100 agencies now operating in the U. S. They act as go-betweens. An agency helps you find a surrogate and make arrangements. It also collects any fees that get passed between you and the surrogate, such as paying for her medical expenses. Right now there aren't any regulations about who can be a surrogate mother. But experts agree on a few points about how to select one. You should choose a surrogate who: Is at least 21 years old Has already given birth to at least one healthy baby so she understands firsthand the medical risks of pregnancy and childbirth and the emotional issues of bonding with a newborn Has passed a psychological screening by a mental health professional to uncover any issues with giving up the baby after birth Signs a contract about her role and responsibilities in the pregnancy, such as prenatal care and agreeing to give you the baby after birth The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says a surrogate should get a medical exam to check that she's likely to have a healthy, full-term pregnancy. The organization suggests she gets tests that check for infectious diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C. Surrogates should get tests to make sure they have immunity to measles, rubella ( German measles), and chickenpox. Also, you may want to ask that she get a medical procedure to visually ""map"" the uterus, which can help the doctor check her potential to carry a pregnancy. A surrogate mother should have her own doctor during pregnancy rather than use yours. The cost of surrogacy can range from $80,000 to $120,000. A lot of different things go into the price, such as whether the surrogate has her own medical insurance or whether you need to buy a surrogacy-pregnancy policy for her. Parental rights aren't guaranteed after a surrogate pregnancy. The law continues to change as reproductive technology and the very definition of a ""parent"" changes. There isn't a federal law on surrogacy and state laws vary. After a surrogate pregnancy in some states, you may still have to pass adoption proceedings to gain legal custody of the child. In other states, a ""declaration of parentage"" before birth lets you avoid having to ""adopt"" the baby. To protect your rights as parents-to-be -- and the rights of the child you're hoping to have -- hire an attorney who specializes in reproductive law in your state. He can write a surrogacy contract that clearly spells out what everyone needs to do. A contract like that may help if legal issues come up after birth. It can also outline agreements about a variety of possible scenarios with the pregnancy, such as what happens if there are twins or triplets."
298,"Common symptoms of bursitis include: Pain and (rarely) swelling in the shoulders, elbows, hips, or knees, particularly stretching or extending the joint while exercising, lifting, or otherwise pushing the joint to its limits Restricted or lost range of motion in a joint, especially affecting the shoulder, with or without immediate pain Muscle weakness due to pain Pain in or near a joint persists more than two weeks. You are unable to move the affected area. You have unusual swelling near a joint, such as the elbow. You have a fever with your bursitis symptoms."
299,"Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that's in many foods, and it's made naturally in our bodies. For many years, high doses of alpha-lipoic acid supplements have been used in parts of Europe for certain types of nerve damage. Studies suggest that they might also help with type 2 diabetes. Why do people take alpha-lipoic acid? We have strong evidence that alpha-lipoic acid supplements help with type 2 diabetes. Several studies have found that they can improve insulin resistance. Studies also found that alpha-lipoic acid supplements can help with neuropathy -- nerve damage -- caused by diabetes or cancer treatment. They seem to reduce symptoms like pain, tingling, and prickling in the feet and legs. It may also help protect the retina from some of the damage that can occur in people with diabetes. Although these uses are promising, diabetes and cancer obviously need proper medical treatment. So don't treat yourself on your own with supplements. Instead, see your doctor and ask if alpha-lipoic acid might help. There's some early evidence that long-term use of alpha-lipoic acid might help with the symptoms of dementia. Other studies suggest that an alpha-lipoic acid cream might help skin damage related to aging. However, more research needs to be done. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been researched as a treatment for many other conditions. These include Amanita mushroom poisoning, glaucoma, kidney disease, migraines, and peripheral arterial disease. So far, the evidence is not clear. How much alpha-lipoic acid should you take? Because alpha-lipoic acid is an unproven treatment, there is no established dose. However, studies have used between 600-1,800 milligrams daily for diabetes and neuropathy; one review concluded that the evidence is convincing for the use of 600 milligrams daily for three weeks on symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Some studies have used intravenous alpha-lipoic acid instead of oral supplements. Can you get alpha-lipoic acid naturally from foods? Many foods contain alpha-lipoic acid in very low amounts. They include spinach, broccoli, yams, potatoes, yeast, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots, beets, and rice bran. Red meat -- and particularly organ meat -- is also a source of alpha-lipoic acid. What are the risks of taking alpha-lipoic acid? Side effects. Generally, side effects are uncommon. These supplements could cause nausea, dizziness, or a rash. Topical alpha-lipoic acid can irritate the skin. Risks. Because alpha-lipoic acid can lower blood sugar or other important nutrients, check with a doctor before using it if you have diabetes. Your doctor might want to test your glucose levels regularly while you use alpha-lipoic acid supplements. If you have thyroid problems, a thiamine deficiency (sometimes found in alcoholics or those with anorexia, for example), or any other medical issue, talk to your doctor before you start taking alpha-lipoic acid supplements. Interactions. If you take any medicines or supplements regularly, see your doctor before you start using alpha-lipoic acid. People with diabetes need to be especially careful. Using it along with diabetes drugs could make blood sugar levels drop too low. Alpha-lipoic acid might also decrease the effect of some chemotherapy drugs. It could also interact with certain antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, tranquilizers, vasodilators (used for heart disease or high blood pressure), and drugs for osteoarthritis. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, alpha-lipoic acid is not recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."
300,"Maybe you're settling into your easy chair for a little Sunday siesta. Or you're heading out the door for a day of fun in the sun. Either way, you stop and pause, because you've got an itch that just won't leave you alone -- along with blotches of red on your skin. What gives? Your doctor needs to make the final call, but psoriasis or eczema could be the problem. Both are skin conditions with similar symptoms, but there are ways to tell them apart. Eczema causes an intense itch. It can get so bad that you scratch enough to make your skin bleed. Psoriasis could also be itchy, but there's something extra going on. Your skin may sting or burn. Some people say it feels like you're getting bitten by fire ants. Eczema makes your skin red and inflamed. It may be scaly, oozing, or crusty. You may see rough, leathery patches that are sometimes dark. It can also cause swelling. Psoriasis can also cause red patches. They may be silvery and scaly -- and raised up high. But if you look closely, the skin is thicker and more inflamed than with eczema. Eczema often appears on parts of your body that bend, like your inner elbow or behind your knees. You can have it on your neck, wrists, and ankles. Babies sometimes get it on their chin, cheeks, scalp, chest, back, arms, and legs. Psoriasis often shows up on places like your: Elbows Knees Scalp and face Lower back Palms of your hands Soles of your feet You may also have patches on other areas, such as: Fingernails and toenails Mouth and lips Eyelids Ears Skin folds Eczema usually results from things that irritate your skin, like: Soaps Detergents Disinfectants Juices from produce or meats Things that cause allergies can also set off eczema, like: Dust Pets Pollen Mold Dandruff Some foods Infections can start up eczema, and so can stress, sweating, heat, humidity, and changes in your hormones. Psoriasis shares some of these triggers, like stress and infection. But you can also get flare-ups when your skin is injured, for example by: Vaccination Sunburn Scratches Some medications can also bring on a psoriasis flare, like , which treats bipolar disorder, or drugs for malaria. Eczema usually starts in babies or young children. Often, symptoms improve when a kid becomes a grown-up. It's less common, but possible, to get it as an adult. When that happens, it's usually because you have another condition like thyroid disease, hormone changes, or stress. Psoriasis, on the other hand, usually shows up between ages 15 and 35. But you can get it at other ages too. It's rare for a baby to have it. Eczema usually comes along with dry, sensitive skin. You may have someone in your family who has it or has asthma or hay fever. Psoriasis is linked to other serious health conditions. If you have it, you may also have diabetes, heart disease, or depression. Whether it's psoriasis or eczema, your doctor can recommend ways to get relief for it. Eczema treatment depends on how severe it is. For mild to moderate cases, you'll take a corticosteroid to control inflammation, and you'll use an emollient on your skin. This type of moisturizer has an oil or cream base, not a water base, like lotion, which could dry your skin out more. If you have moderate to severe eczema, you may need to try a medicine that affects your immune system like , methotrexate, azathioprine, or . If nothing else works, you might get a biologic drug called dupilumab ( Dupixent). You might also try light therapy (your doctor will call it phototherapy) using ultraviolet light. Psoriasis treatment is either systemic, which means it affects your entire body, or topical, which goes on your skin. If your disease is limited, or mild, you may be able to control it with topical corticosteroids and emollients. Light therapy paired with methotrexate, cyclosporine, acretin, or apremilast is also an option for more severe cases. Or you could pair phototherapy with one of several biologic drugs, including: Adalimumab Etanercept Infliximab Certolizumab pegol Ustekinumab Secukinumab Ixekizumab Guselkumab Tildrakizumab"

This rash is a form of allergic contact dermatitis. Dermatitis simply means an irritation of the skin. It's called ""allergic contact dermatitis"" because the rash is caused by contact with a substance to which you're allergic. Have you ever wondered: Can I get poison ivy? What you're really asking is: Am I allergic to the plant? Not everyone is. Up to 85% of Americans are allergic to poison ivy, leaving at least 15% resistant to any reaction. If you are allergic to poison ivy, you're more likely to be allergic to poison oak and poison sumac, because all three plants contain the same rash-triggering plant oil called urushiol (pronounced yoo- ROO-shee-all). You're also more likely to have an allergic reaction to other plant resins, such as the oil from Japanese lacquer trees (used on furniture), mango rinds, and cashew shells. Sensitivity to poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac varies from a mild to severe reaction, and may not cause any reaction at all the first time you're exposed. Some adults who reacted to poison ivy as children may find that they are now less sensitive. Some may even lose their sensitivity altogether. Many people break out in a rash when urushiol touches the skin. And even if you don't recall touching the leaves of poison ivy, oak, or sumac, you may have unwittingly come in contact with their roots or stems. Urushiol quickly penetrates the skin, often leaving red lines that show where you brushed against the plant. Symptoms appear 24 to 72 hours after exposure. Scratching the itchy rash doesn't cause it to spread but can prolong skin healing and cause a secondary infection. The rash isn't contagious, so you won't spread it to others by going to school or work. Three types of transmission can occur: Direct contact with the plant Indirect contact when you touch pets, gardening tools, sports equipment, or other objects that had direct contact with the plant Airborne contact from burning these plants, which releases particles of urushiol into the air that can penetrate the skin, eyes, nose, throat, or respiratory system Symptoms, which generally last from one to two weeks, include: Red streaks or patches Itching Rash Swelling Blisters that may ""weep"" (leak fluid) and later crust over Inflammation and a burning sensation Does it matter which plant you're exposed to? Poison ivy, oak, and sumac all fall into the plant species called Toxicodendron, so the allergic reaction to all of these plants has the same name: Toxicodendron dermatitis. There are actually four poisonous plants in this group, since poison oak has both a western and an eastern variation. All four plants contain urushiol, so the skin reaction and treatment are essentially the same. Poison ivy, oak, and sumac are generally diagnosed by their common symptoms of a rash, blisters, and itching following activity outside in a forest or field, but if you have any doubt, ask your doctor. Self-care for a mild rash includes: Wash the area well with mild soap and lukewarm water as soon as possible after contact. Wash all clothes, shoes, socks, tools, pets, and toys that may have become contaminated. Cool compresses may help during the blistering phase. Use a topical corticosteroid cream on the rash as directed by your doctor. Try calamine lotion for the itching, but avoid skin products that contain anesthetics or antihistamines, which can cause their own allergic reaction. To help relieve the itch, try cool showers or a mixture of baking soda and water applied to the area. If sleep is a problem because of the itching, try an over-the-counter oral antihistamine at night. Call your doctor or a dermatologist for: Severe blistering, swelling, and itching Symptoms in sensitive areas such as the eyes, lips, throat, or genitals Fever A rash over large areas of your body A rash lasting longer than a week to 10 days Blisters that become infected with pus Get immediate medical help for any difficulty breathing or severe coughing after exposure to burning plants. In some cases, an oral steroid or other medication may be needed to relieve severe symptoms. Remember the old adage: "" Leaflets three, let them be."" Poison ivy and poison oak have a triple-leaf structure you can learn to recognize -- and then avoid. Avoid any contact with these plants when possible. Cover your skin completely when hiking, camping, or working in forests and around shrubs; wear long sleeves, long pants, gloves, socks, and boots. Remember that you can also get a rash from indirect contact from clothes, pets, or tools that have urushiol on them. Ask your doctor about over-the-counter skin products that contain a barrier such as bentoquatam to help protect the skin from urushiol if you work outside in forestry or other jobs at risk of frequent exposure."
302,"Do your shins throb and ache after your daily run or just sprinting to catch the bus? It could be shin splints. You might hear a doctor call it medial tibial stress syndrome. The cause is stress on your shinbone and the connective tissues that attach muscles to your bones. They get inflamed and painful. This common problem can result from: Flat feet -- when the impact of a step makes your foot's arch collapse (your doctor will call this overpronation) Shoes that don't fit well or provide good support Working out without warmup or cooldown stretches Weak ankles, hips, or core muscles If you're active, you could get them if you make sudden changes like more intense, more frequent, or longer workouts. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } They often heal on their own. If you see a doctor, expect to get a thorough physical exam. She may want to watch you run to look for problems. She might also take X-rays or bone scans to look for fractures. Rest your body. It needs time to heal. Ice your shin to ease pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days, or until the pain is gone. Use insoles or orthotics for your shoes. Shoe inserts -- which can be custom-made or bought off the shelf -- may help if your arches collapse or flatten when you stand up. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers, if you need them. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, will help with pain and swelling. These drugs can have side effects, though, like a greater chance of bleeding and ulcers. Use them as directed on the label, unless your doctor says otherwise. You'll know they're fully healed when: Your injured leg is as flexible as your other leg. Your injured leg feels as strong as your other leg. You can push hard on spots that used to be painful. You can jog, sprint, and jump without pain. There's no way to say exactly when your shin splints will go away. It depends on what caused them. People also heal at different rates; 3 to 6 months isn't unusual. The most important thing is that you don't rush back into your sport. If you start to work out before your shin heals, you may hurt yourself permanently. Take up a new no-impact activity that won't aggravate your shin splints while they heal. If you're a runner, try swimming or an aggressive interval bike program. If your shin splints don't get better, or if they come back, your doctor may suggest you see a physical therapist. He can treat issues in your legs or the way you move that could cause the problem. A therapist can also help ease the pain and guide your return to sport. He'll also make sure you don't have a stress fracture -- tiny cracks in your tibia."
303,"What does it mean to be quarantined? People who have been exposed to an infectious disease and may be infected but are not yet ill may be quarantined. That is, they may be asked to remain at home or another location to prevent further spread of illness to others and to carefully monitor for the disease. During quarantine people are able to do most things they can do indoors within the constraints of the location they are at. For example, if people are asked to stay at home then they would usually be asked to take their own temperature and report daily to health authorities on how they are feeling. They are given instructions on what they can do and not do around family members and are informed of other disease precautions. If they are asked to stay in a place away from home they are provided with meals, sleeping accommodations, and other necessities. They would stay there until the risk of developing the disease or spreading the disease is over. Another measure of disease control is called isolation. This is for individuals who are sick from the contagious disease. These individuals are kept separate from others -- or ""isolated"" -- usually within a health care facility or at home. Typically, the ill person will have his or her own room, and caretakers will take certain precautions such as wearing protective clothing. Quarantine and isolation are usually undertaken voluntarily but in rare circumstances can be required by public health authorities. These measures are implemented to contain and prevent the transmission of an infectious disease. It will last enough time for medical personnel to assess the situation or for the duration of the contagious period."
304,"Sleep researchers conclude that, in most cases, sleep paralysis is simply a sign that your body is not moving smoothly through the stages of sleep. Rarely is sleep paralysis linked to deep underlying psychiatric problems. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Over the centuries, symptoms of sleep paralysis have been described in many ways and often attributed to an ""evil"" presence: unseen night demons in ancient times, the old hag in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and alien abductors. Almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night. People have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep-time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror. Sleep paralysis is a feeling of being conscious but unable to move. It occurs when a person passes between stages of wakefulness and sleep. During these transitions, you may be unable to move or speak for a few seconds up to a few minutes. Some people may also feel pressure or a sense of choking. Sleep paralysis may accompany other sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is an overpowering need to sleep caused by a problem with the brain's ability to regulate sleep. Sleep paralysis usually occurs at one of two times. If it occurs while you are falling asleep, it's called hypnagogic or predormital sleep paralysis. If it happens as you are waking up, it's called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep paralysis. As you fall asleep, your body slowly relaxes. Usually you become less aware, so you do not notice the change. However, if you remain or become aware while falling asleep, you may notice that you cannot move or speak. During sleep, your body alternates between REM (rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. One cycle of REM and NREM sleep lasts about 90 minutes. NREM sleep occurs first and takes up to 75% of your overall sleep time. During NREM sleep, your body relaxes and restores itself. At the end of NREM, your sleep shifts to REM. Your eyes move quickly and dreams occur, but the rest of your body remains very relaxed. Your muscles are ""turned off"" during REM sleep. If you become aware before the REM cycle has finished, you may notice that you cannot move or speak. Up to as many as four out of every 10 people may have sleep paralysis. This common condition is often first noticed in the teen years. But men and women of any age can have it. Sleep paralysis may run in families. Other factors that may be linked to sleep paralysis include: Lack of sleep Sleep schedule that changes Mental conditions such as stress or bipolar disorder Sleeping on the back Other sleep problems such as narcolepsy or nighttime leg cramps Use of certain medications, such as those for ADHD Substance abuse If you find yourself unable to move or speak for a few seconds or minutes when falling asleep or waking up, then it is likely you have isolated recurrent sleep paralysis. Often there is no need to treat this condition. Check with your doctor if you have any of these concerns: You feel anxious about your symptoms Your symptoms leave you very tired during the day Your symptoms keep you up during the night Your doctor may want to gather more information about your sleep health by doing any of the following: Ask you to describe your symptoms and keep a sleep diary for a few weeks Discuss your health history, including any known sleep disorders or any family history of sleep disorders Refer you to a sleep specialist for further evaluation Conduct overnight sleep studies or daytime nap studies to make sure you do not have another sleep disorder Most people need no treatment for sleep paralysis. Treating any underlying conditions such as narcolepsy may help if you are anxious or unable to sleep well. These treatments may include the following: Improving sleep habits -- such as making sure you get six to eight hours of sleep each night Using antidepressant medication if it is prescribed to help regulate sleep cycles Treating any mental health problems that may contribute to sleep paralysis Treating any other sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or leg cramps There's no need to fear nighttime demons or alien abductors. If you have occasional sleep paralysis, you can take steps at home to control this disorder. Start by making sure you get enough sleep. Do what you can to relieve stress in your life -- especially just before bedtime. Try new sleeping positions if you sleep on your back. And be sure to see your doctor if sleep paralysis routinely prevents you from getting a good night's sleep."
305,"About 20% of people get hives -- itchy red or skin-colored welts also known as urticaria. They're often caused by an allergic reaction to a food or drug. Usually, they go away quickly. For a small number of people, though, hives come back again and again, with no known cause. When new outbreaks happen almost every day for 6 weeks or more, it's called chronic idiopathic urticaria ( CIU). One percent or less of people have it. It's most common in people between the ages of 20 and 40. With CIU, a single outbreak usually lasts no more than 24 hours. After that, new hives form. Experts don't know. The immune system seems to play a role. Some people get chronic hives at the same time that they get other problems like thyroid disease, hormonal problems, or cancer. Even though doctors can't say for sure what causes CIU, they do know things that can lead to flare-ups. They include: Alcoholic drinks Tight clothing Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS) like aspirin and ibuprofen Exercise Cold Heat If you've had hives for several weeks and don't know why, see your doctor. She'll want to know: When and where they pop up How long they last Possible triggers If you have swelling What other symptoms you have If you're taking new meds She'll also ask about the foods you eat and if you have pets, to see if an allergy is to blame. She may check for other illnesses or conditions that could be causing the hives, like an overactive or underactive thyroid. If she can't find a cause, you'll likely be diagnosed with CIU. No. And while it's itchy and painful, it isn't dangerous. Chronic hives don't last forever. Most people have them for 1 to 5 years. For a small number of people, it can last longer. There's no known cure, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help you feel better."
306,"This condition, which your doctor will call nyctalopia, makes it hard to see well at night or in poor light. It isn't a disease, but rather a symptom of another problem like untreated nearsightedness. The problem comes from a disorder of the cells in your retina that allow you to see dim light. It has many causes: Nearsightedness Glaucoma Glaucoma medications that close the pupil Cataracts Diabetes Retinitis pigmentosa Vitamin A deficiency Keratoconus To pinpoint the cause, your eye doctor will carry out a full exam. He may order specialized tests. That depends on its cause. It may be as simple as a new prescription for glasses or a new medication. It could require surgery if cataracts are to blame."
307,"If you want to improve your erectile dysfunction ( ED) or take steps to prevent it, make some changes to the way you live. A healthy diet and regular exercise are key parts of the plan. Research suggests there's a link between ED and obesity. Recent studies show that overweight men with extra fat in the stomach and waist have lower levels of male sex hormones. Men with extra body fat break also break down male hormones faster than leaner guys. This may be another reason why obese men have higher rates of ED than lean men. Follow some of these tips to get on the road to a healthy lifestyle. If you're obese, talk to your doctor about a more rigorous treatment plan. Eat healthy food. Go for a diet that limits saturated fat and has several portions of fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Reduce cholesterol . High cholesterol levels can harden, narrow, and block the arteries leading to the penis. This is called atherosclerosis. You can lower your cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medication. Maintain a healthy weight . If you're overweight, talk to your doctor or a dietitian to get a plan to help you drop some pounds. Exercise regularly. Choose activities that you enjoy. Besides lowering the chances that you'll get ED, physical activity can also help you manage stress. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program."
308,"Allergy tests are a way to get to the bottom of what's causing your asthma symptoms. They help your doctor find out if allergies trigger your asthma. These tests won't identify asthma triggers such as exercise, stress, or illnesses like a cold. Allergy tests alone are not enough to make an asthma diagnosis. Your doctor will look at your history of allergic reactions, too. Several types of allergy tests help with asthma, including skin tests and blood tests. The results may show what's triggering your asthma and allergy symptoms, and that can help with your treatment. Your doctor may recommend skin tests if they think a specific allergen is causing your asthma symptoms. Allergy skin tests are quick, fairly reliable, and cost-effective. Your doctor will have test results usually within an hour of the skin test. If you have poorly controlled asthma, trouble breathing, or a high risk of anaphylactic reactions, your doctor may wait to do skin tests. Ask your doctor if you need to do anything before the test. For example, you should stop taking antihistamines before you get an allergy test. Your doctor may have other specific instructions, too. In a skin test, you get a dose of a possible allergen. The test tracks your body response -- specifically, if your body makes a molecule called immunoglobulin E ( Ig E). A high level of Ig E can mean you have an allergy. Skin prick test: The skin prick test is the most common allergy skin test. First, you get a series of tiny drops of allergens on your skin, usually on your back. Then you get a quick needle prick in the skin underneath each drop. If you're allergic, you'll get a dime-sized hive that's red and itchy at the needle prick site. You may need a follow-up test to check the results. Intradermal test: If your skin prick test was negative, your doctor may try an intradermal test. In this test, your doctor injects the allergen into your skin. Intradermal allergy tests are often used for environmental allergies and drug allergies. Doctors usually don't use this type of allergy test with food or latex allergies. Intradermal tests can be more accurate, but sometimes they may be falsely positive. That means they show that you have an allergy when you actually don't. Intradermal tests are also more likely to cause an allergic reaction that affects your whole body. Patch test: Your doctor applies the allergen to a patch. You'll leave the patch on your skin for 48 hours. If your skin turns red, gets irritated, and itches, the chances are great that you have an allergy. Your doctor may also recommend getting an allergy blood test or an immunoassay test. They include: ELISA or EIA. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test measures the amount of allergen-specific antibodies in your blood. RAST. The RAST (radioallergosorbent test) also looks for specific allergen-related antibodies in order to identify your allergy triggers. Since the introduction of the ELISA test, RAST testing has not typically been used."
309,"It's important to track your condition carefully when you have heart failure. You'll be able to manage your symptoms better if you keep tabs on your health and make some simple tweaks to your everyday habits. Also, ask your doctor if he can remotely monitor your blood pressure, weight, and heart rate. Many doctors now offer this service. Step on the scale at the same time each day. For example, you could weigh yourself in the morning after you pee but before breakfast. Use the same scale each time, and try to wear similar clothing. Write your weight down each day in a diary or on a calendar. Call your doctor if you gain 2 or more pounds in a day or 5 or more in a week. Also call if you see signs that your body is holding on to fluid. How will you notice? Watch for things like your clothes fitting differently or your belly, feet, or ankles swelling. Your doctor may ask you to try this for a couple of days: Cut 500 milligrams of salt from your diet Drink less liquid If neither of these things works, let your doctor know. He may need to adjust your medications. If your doctor wants you to cut back how much fluid you get each day, keep a record of how much you drink. You may need to keep it to 8 cups (which is 64 ounces, or 2 quarts) every 24 hours. Keep in mind that some foods are considered fluids, too. These include: Pudding Gelatin (like Jell- O) Soups (thin or thick) Ice pops Ice cream One way to keep tabs on how much fluid you have is to fill a 2-quart pitcher to the top with water every day and put it in an easy-to-reach place in your kitchen. Every time you drink or eat something that's considered a fluid, remove the same amount of water from the pitcher. When it's empty, you've hit your limit for the day. Just because you're thirsty doesn't mean your body needs more fluid. If you do get thirsty, but you're near or at your limit of fluids for the day, try this: Nibble on frozen grapes or strawberries. Suck on ice chips (not cubes), a sucker, or a washcloth soaked in ice-cold water. Cover your lips with petroleum jelly, flavored lip balm, or lip moisturizer. Suck on hard candy or chew sugarless gum. Your doctor may also ask you to record how much you pee. If you feel short of breath at night, try this: Sleep in a recliner chair. Use more pillows. Get a cushion for support so that you rest more upright. To breathe better: Listen to your body and slow down when you're short of breath. Take breaks throughout the day: read, pay bills, write letters, use the computer for fun. Use music, meditation, or yoga to ease stress. If you feel breathless, short of breath, or you have trouble breathing, talk to your doctor. He may ask you to eat less salt or drink less liquid for a couple of days. If neither of these helps, call your doctor. He may need to tweak your medicine. Keep all your appointments with your care team. It'll increase your chances of staying on track with your treatment plan. If you have questions about your condition, write them down and take them with you to your appointments. If you have urgent questions, call the doctor. If you see any other doctor, let him know about your heart failure medications and your diet or fluid restrictions. When you go to your appointment, take a list of your medications and any allergies you have. If another doctor prescribes any other drugs, call your heart doctor before you take them. Make sure you know how to treat yourself if you have a virus, the flu, or a fever. Don't take any over-the-counter drugs unless you ask your doctor first. Ask him about getting the flu shot every year and the pneumonia vaccine so you can stay healthy. Also talk to your doctor if you are having sexual problems or feel depressed. When you have heart failure, using tobacco causes your blood pressure to rise and raises your risk for many other conditions. If you quit, you will probably: Live longer Improve your health Feel better Look better (smoking can cause face wrinkles, stained teeth, yellow-stained fingers, and dull skin) Improve your senses of taste and smell Save money"
310,"One of the most common forms of electrical stimulation used for pain management is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS) therapy, which provides short-term pain relief. Electrical nerve stimulation and electrothermal therapy are used to relieve pain associated with various conditions, including back pain. Intradiscal electrothermal therapy ( IDET) is a treatment option for people with low back pain resulting from intervertebral disc problems. In TENS therapy for pain management, a small, battery-operated device delivers low-voltage electrical current through the skin via electrodes placed near the source of pain. The electricity from the electrodes stimulates nerves in the affected area and sends signals to the brain that ""scramble"" normal pain perception. TENS is not painful and may be effective therapy to mask pain such as diabetic neuropathy. However, TENS for chronic low back pain is not effective and cannot be recommended, the American Academy of Neurology ( AAN) now says. Intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae. Sometimes the discs can become damaged and cause pain. IDET uses heat to modify the nerve fibers of a spinal disc and to destroy pain receptors in the area. In this procedure, a wire called an electrothermal catheter is placed through an incision in the disc. An electrical current passes through the wire, heating a small outer portion of the disc to a temperature of 90 degrees Celsius. IDET is performed as an outpatient procedure while the patient is awake and under a local anesthesia. Early studies indicated that some patients may have continued pain relief for up to six months or longer. The long-term effects of this procedure on the disc, however, have not been determined. More studies are needed to compare this treatment to standard therapies and surgery as well as placebo. Radiofrequency discal nucleoplasty is a newer procedure which utilizes a radio frequency probe instead of heating wire to disintegrate a small portion of the central disc material. The result of this intervention is partial decompression of the disc, which may help relieve pain caused by bulging discs pressing on nearby spinal nerve roots."
311,"Getting their nose reshaped is the most common cosmetic surgery done among American teens. It's usually an outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia. This means you go to where the surgery is done and then go home the same day. Getting a ""nose job,"" which doctors call rhinoplasty, can be very simple or very complex. When done correctly by an experienced surgeon, it can make a big difference in how a person looks. Teens should not have a nose job until the nose has reached its adult size. This normally happens at about age 15 or 16 for girls. It usually happens a year or so later for boys. Types of rhinoplasty include: Removing a hump on the nose Straightening the bridge Reshaping the nose's tip Increasing or decreasing the size of the nostrils Correcting the nose after an injury Opening breathing passages Making the nose bigger or smaller Nose jobs can be done to change how you look or for medical reasons. For example, some people may need surgery to repair a problem with the cartilage that divides one nostril from the other. Others may just want to make their nose smaller. Any type of surgery has risks. These include bleeding, infection, and allergic reaction to anesthesia. Risks of rhinoplasty include: Numbness Nosebleeds Scarring at the base of the nose Bursting of small blood vessels on the skin's surface Swelling Permanent nerve damage Need for a second or third operation Before getting a nose job, teens and their parents or guardians should talk extensively with the surgeon and weigh all of the risks and benefits. Honest communication between you, your parents, and the surgeon is very important to the success of the operation. Many plastic surgeons take a lot of time to talk with teens before doing surgery. They want to make sure the teen is mature enough to handle it, is doing it for the correct reasons, and has realistic expectations about the results. For instance, thinking changing your nose will change your whole life and make you more popular is not being realistic. After a nose job, recovery takes patience and support from family and friends. You will need to keep your head elevated for at least 24 hours after the operation. And there will be some pain and swelling (which can be managed with medication and cold compresses). Some people become discouraged with the swelling and how they look immediately after the operation. But when the swelling goes down, the redness disappears and the nose fully heals. This can take weeks, but most people like the results. Look for a surgeon who is experienced in plastic surgery of the nose and who has a reputation for achieving patient satisfaction. The American Board of Plastic Surgery ( ABPS) is the most common body that certifies rhinoplasty surgeons. It's best to have the procedure done in an accredited facility. If you have a complication, an experienced surgeon working with a well-trained team will be able to assess and correct the situation. You should talk to your surgeon in advance to describe your goals and learn about the risks and benefits. You should also ask your surgeon for information on what it will cost. If you have health insurance, talk to your health insurance company so you're clear on what will be covered and what you will pay for. Health insurance companies usually don't pay for plastic surgery unless there's a medical reason for the operation."
312,"It's not surprising if your doctor tells you that you have atrial fibrillation ( AFib) and heart failure at the same time. The two conditions are closely tied to each other. You need your heart to do one job and do it really well: pump blood throughout your body. For that, it needs a regular rhythm and strong, healthy muscle. But if you have AFib, your heart's upper chambers -- the atria -- are out of sync. They don't have that nice steady rhythm. Instead, they might be quivering like Jell- O. With heart failure, the muscles of your heart are too weak to pump enough blood, so you don't get the oxygen you need. AFib can lead to heart failure, and heart failure puts you at greater risk for AFib. When you have both, which is common, symptoms tend to be worse than when you have just one or the other. When you have AFib, your heart typically beats faster than normal, even when you're just resting. And since the heart's doing more of quiver than a strong push, it ends up sending out only a fraction of the blood it normally would. It's like the difference between a bunch of short, frantic bursts on a bike pump versus long, steady strokes. AFib can also cause fluid buildup in your lungs. Your lungs fill your blood with oxygen before sending it back to your heart. So now, your heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood from the lungs, and even if it does, it's beating too fast to do a good job of pumping it out. And a rapid heartbeat -- or just one that's never regular -- can damage the muscles of your heart. All of that sets the stage for heart failure. Even though your heart's working really hard -- too hard -- your body's still not getting the oxygen it needs. It works in the other direction, too. Your heart's rhythm is controlled by electrical signals. For those signals to work well, they need healthy heart tissue. But heart failure can actually stretch your atria and cause tissue in your heart to thicken and scar. Those changes throw off the electrical signals, and that messes up the heart's rhythm and can cause AFib. AFib and heart failure are both common on their own. But many people have both, and doctors aren't totally clear why. One reason may be that many of the same things raise your chances of having both conditions. Risks you can't control. Some things you just can't change, such as: Age. The older you are, the greater the chances you'll get AFib or heart failure. Most people who have both conditions are older adults. Genes. There's still a lot of research to be done here, but certain differences in your genes may affect how likely it is that you end up with heart failure or AFib. Gender. Men are more likely to have these conditions than women. Heart disease. Your odds for heart failure and AFib go up if you have other heart conditions, such as: Coronary artery disease, where plaque builds up in your heart's arteries and leads to less blood flow Cardiomyopathy, which is damage to your heart muscle Heart valve problems, such as a leaky valve or a valve that doesn't fully open Myocarditis, where the muscles of your heart get swollen and irritated Other health conditions. Other health issues can also raise your risk, such as: Diabetes, since it increases your odds for coronary artery disease and high blood pressure High blood pressure, which over time can weaken, stiffen, and thicken your heart tissue Obesity, as it often leads to higher blood pressure and raises your chances of having diabetes Overactive thyroid, because too much thyroid hormone can make your heart beat faster than normal Sleep apnea, which can lead to lower oxygen levels while you sleep and affect your heart's rhythm Smoking and drinking alcohol. Just on its own, smoking raises your odds for all kinds of heart disease, including AFib and heart failure. But it's even more dangerous if you have risks in play. Over time, heavy drinking weakens your heart's muscles. And for some people, alcohol acts as a trigger for AFib."
313,"If you have heart disease, it's important to do all you can to avoid getting the flu. You'll have a harder time fighting off viruses that cause the illness. In fact, people with heart trouble are more likely to get the flu than people with any other long-term (chronic) illness. Viral infections like the flu also put added stress on your body, which can affect your blood pressure, heart rate, and overall heart function. That can raise your odds of having a heart attack or stroke. But none of this has to happen. The flu is easy to prevent. You can take simple steps now to avoid serious problems later on. The flu usually comes on quickly. You have: Fever (usually high) Severe aches and pains in the joints and muscles and around the eyes Generalized weakness Warm, flushed skin and red, watery eyes Headache Dry cough Sore throat and watery discharge from the nose When you're shopping for an over-the-counter ( OTC) medication, check the label. Look for a product that's decongestant-free or made just for people with high blood pressure. Decongestants can raise your blood pressure and interfere with other medications. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you try any OTC treatment. Make sure you tell each of your doctors about all of the medicines you're taking -- prescription and over the counter. Get a flu shot. The CDC says the best time to do it is as soon as the shot becomes available in the fall. If you miss it then, you can get it through January or even later. Flu season can begin as early as October and last through May -- but the earlier in the season you get vaccinated, the better. Ask for the flu shot, not Flu Mist. People with heart disease shouldn't receive the live vaccine that's given as a nasal spray in Flu Mist. . You can take other steps to stay well, too. Keep your hands clean to help prevent the flu. Thorough washing is vital to keep germs off your hands, so you don't bring them into your body through your mouth, nose, or eyes. Let her know if you think you might have the flu. She may want you to come to the office for an exam and tests. If you do have it, she'll recommend an antiviral drug. It will ease symptoms and shorten your illness if you take it early on. Call your doctor immediately if you have the following problems: Symptoms that don't improve or get worse after 3 to 4 days of illness You feel a little better, then you start to feel much worse -- sick-to-your-stomach, vomiting, high fever, shaking chills, chest pain, or coughing with thick yellow-green mucus. If your symptoms get worse, you may need urgent medical care. Call 911 if you have trouble breathing or any other signs of a health emergency. Don't wait to call 911 or go to the emergency room if you have heart disease and the flu. It's better to get a quick medical exam and treatment than to risk waiting to see if your symptoms get better on their own."
314,"Prostate cancer is not often a cause of erectile dysfunction (or ED). However, treatments for the disease can cause it. The current methods of treating prostate cancer, including surgery with radical prostatectomy (removal of the entire prostate gland), radiation therapy -- whether by external beam or brachytherapy (seed implant) -- and hormone therapy, can all cause ED. Radical prostatectomy. Erectile dysfunction can begin immediately following the removal of the entire prostate and surrounding tissues, whether the nerve-sparing or non-nerve-sparing technique is used. If the nerve-sparing technique is used, recovery from ED may occur within the first year following the procedure. Recovery of erectile function after a non-nerve-sparing technique is unlikely but possible. Radiation therapy. The onset of ED following radiation therapy is gradual and usually begins within 2 to 3 years following treatment. Without treatment for erectile dysfunction, ED is usually permanent. Hormone therapy. When hormone therapy is used, ED may occur approximately two to four weeks following the initiation of the therapy and is usually accompanied by a decreased desire for sex. Without treatment, the ED may become permanent. The current treatment options for erectile dysfunction for people who have received treatment for prostate cancer include: Pills, including Cialis, Levitra, Stendra, Staxyn, and Viagra Intracavernous injection therapy Vacuum constriction device Intraurethral therapy Penile prosthesis"
315,"Your doctor will ask about any allergies you may have, as well as about your eating patterns, what medicines you take, and whether you drink alcohol or smoke. Your doctor will also examine your throat and nasal passages for any signs of nasal, mouth, dental, jaw, or throat deformities that may contribute to snoring. If your doctor suspects that you have obstructive sleep apnea, your partner may be asked to keep a diary noting your sleeping and snoring patterns. You can also take a sleep-monitoring study, which will analyze if, when, and how often you stop breathing during sleep. There are hundreds of products, exercises, medical devices, drugs, and surgeries that claim to treat snoring. However, in most cases, simple lifestyle changes can help stop snoring. They include: Don't drink alcohol within three hours of bedtime. Avoid sedatives and antihistamines, especially at bedtime. If you're overweight, get to and maintain a healthy weight. Losing even a few pounds may make a big difference. Exercise can strengthen and tone muscles, including those in the neck. If you suffer from allergies, try to eliminate allergens in the bedroom -- such as removing pets, regularly washing your sheets in hot water to remove dust mites, and removing any mold. Sleep on your side. Use a humidifier if the air in your home is too dry. A variety of products designed to help you sleep on your side -- a position that can decrease snoring -- may help some people. A variety of products designed to dilate the nasal passages, such as nasal strips or nasal support devices, may work in some people with congestion or nasal abnormalities. Other products include pills, sprays, and herbal products that claim to decrease nasal congestion and devices to correct mouth breathing. These haven't been aggressively studied, so caution is advised. Over-the-counter products that work by keeping you in a more wakeful sleep, which does not allow you to obtain a restful, deep sleep. This can contribute to dangerous and excessive sleepiness. If you have a jaw or mouth abnormality that is causing nasal obstruction, your dentist may be able to fit you with a dental appliance to correct the problem and lessen snoring. If your doctor suspects that you have sleep apnea, treatment may include: Weight loss, if you are overweight A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device or BPAP (bilevel postitive airway pressure) device; this is a mask-like device that you wear at night to maintain air pressure in your nose and keep airways open. An implanted device called Inspire. The device, called an upper airway stimulator, consists of a small pulse generator placed under the skin in the upper chest. A wire leading to the lung detects the person's natural breathing pattern. Another wire, leading up to the neck, delivers mild stimulation to nerves that control airway muscles, keeping them open. Surgery; there are a variety of surgeries now available to treat some causes of snoring, including somnoplasty, which uses radiofrequency ablation to shrink the tissues of the soft palate. These types of surgeries may be performed in the office and others in a surgical setting. Your doctor can make a recommendation whether or not surgery would be helpful for you."
316,"See a doctor or go to a hospital emergency room. Sudden, severe pain can be a sign of testicular torsion, a medical emergency. The doctor will do a physical exam and may do tests such as a urinalysis and ultrasound. If there is a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed. To relieve pain and swelling, apply hot or cold packs or take acetaminophen ( Tylenol), ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin), or naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn). Avoid ibuprofen, naproxen, and other NSAIDs if the person has heart failure or kidney failure Elevating the scrotum in snug briefs or an athletic supporter may ease discomfort."
317,"The first phase of heart surgery recovery can last from 6 to 8 weeks. When you're released from the hospital, you'll get a set of instructions for post-surgery care. These will help you heal physically and feel better. Keep the cut your surgeon made clean and dry. You should be able to take a bath or shower within a few days. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Call the doctor if you have any signs of an infection, including: More drainage or oozing than usual Edges pulling apart Redness or warmth around the cut Fever greater than 100 F You should also call your doctor when your breast bone feels like it shifts, or if it pops or cracks when you move. Your doctor will probably prescribe pain medication before you leave the hospital. Some discomfort around the cut and in your muscles -- including itching, tightness, and numbness along the incision -- are normal. But it shouldn't hurt as much as it did before your surgery. If you had a bypass, your legs may hurt more than your chest if the surgeon used leg veins as grafts. The soreness and stiffness will fade with time. Gentle exercise will help, too. For the first 6 to 8 weeks, gradually build up your activity, such as doing household chores. In general, doctors recommend: Don't stand in one place longer than 15 minutes. Don't lift things that weigh more than 10 pounds. Don't push or pull heavy things. Walk every day. Follow the guidelines the doctor or cardiac rehabilitation specialist gives you. Unless you've been told not to, you can climb stairs. Your doctor will let you know when it's OK to drive again, usually within a month or so after surgery. It may be sooner if the surgeon did the operation with a just a small cut. There's no need to wait to ride as a passenger. Healthy food choices help the healing process. Your doctor will let you know if you should have or avoid specific things. You may not feel like eating for a while after your surgery. Try smaller meals, more often. If your appetite doesn't return within a few weeks, bring this up with your doctor. It's common after heart surgery to be sad or blue, but these feelings should pass after the first few weeks. If they don't, talk to your doctor about it. To keep your spirits up: Get dressed every day. Walk daily. Pick up your hobbies and social activities. Share your feelings with others. Get a good night's sleep. Limit visits to 15 minutes at first. As you feel stronger and less tired, spend more time with your visitors. Join a cardiac rehabilitation program or a support group. Many people have trouble sleeping after heart surgery. You should get back to a normal slumber pattern within a few months. If pain keeps you up, take medication about half an hour before bedtime. Arrange the pillows so you can stay in a comfortable position. You'll probably need to rest after activity, but try not to take a lot of naps during the day. In the evening, avoid caffeine, including chocolate, coffee, tea, and some sodas. Settle into a bedtime routine, perhaps listening to relaxing music. Your body will learn these cues mean it's time to snooze. Call your doctor if a lack of sleep starts affecting your mood or behavior."
318,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) is a disease that attacks part of your brain. It happens if your body can't fight off disease the way it should. It damages your brain's white matter -- cells that make a substance called myelin. This protects your nerves, and losing it can make it harder for you to move, think, and feel sensations. PML is a very serious illness that can be fatal. It's caused by a virus called the JC virus. Most adults carry it, and it usually doesn't cause any health problems. But it can if you have a weak immune system -- if your body's natural defenses against illness aren't working right. The first signs of PML can be different from person to person, depending on the nerves that are damaged first. But they often include: Clumsiness or loss of coordination Difficulty walking Facial drooping Loss of vision Personality changes Trouble speaking Weak muscles Sometimes, PML can also cause seizures. About 1 person out of every 200,000 will get PML. That works out to a total of about 4,000 people a year in the United States and Europe combined. It happens most often to people who have AIDS, which attacks the immune system. But people who have some types of cancer or take drugs that keep their body from rejecting a transplanted organ also have a higher risk. People who have multiple sclerosis, which attacks the central nervous system, or other immune system problems, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, may be at risk too. U. S. safety officials have said that PML may be a possible side effect of some drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis after a small number of people who used them got it. If your doctor thinks you might have PML, he'll scan your brain with a magnetic resonance imaging machine ( MRI). This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make a detailed picture. He'll look for lesions -- spots of damaged tissue -- that show the disease is there. If an MRI doesn't give a clear picture, he might do a brain biopsy. He'll take a small sample of tissue from your brain to look at under a microscope for signs of the disease. Your doctor might also take a sample of the fluid around your brain and spinal cord by using a spinal tap -- a needle put into your lower back. The best way to treat PML is to fight whatever has made your immune system weak. You might take drugs that attack the virus that causes AIDS ( HIV) or avoid drugs that affect your immune system. You also might need to avoid treatments like chemotherapy, which can put you at higher risk of infections. Researchers are trying to find other drugs to fight the JC virus, but none has been approved for widespread use. White matter killed by the virus doesn't grow back, so your symptoms may be permanent. Many people who have had PML live with the effects of nerve damage. These can be similar to the issues caused by a stroke and can include paralysis and memory loss."
319,"When you stub your toe, it's hard to say what comes first -- the pain or the swearing. And if you break your toe, you won't believe how much such a small bone can hurt. The good news is that a broken toe doesn't usually need much medical care. In fact, it can be tough to tell whether you broke it or just hurt it badly, and the treatment's often the same. Each of your toes has three bones, except for the big toe, which has two. When you break your toe, you break one of these bones. It often happens when you stub it really hard or drop something on it. When you break a toe, you'll likely have: Pain and tenderness in your toe Pain when you walk or put weight on your foot Redness or bruising Stiffness Swelling Most of the time, your toe will heal in about 4 to 6 weeks. But, it could take as long as 8 weeks for more serious breaks. If you think you broke your toe, it's best to have your doctor look at it. Even though you can often treat it yourself, a broken toe can sometimes lead to more serious problems, like infection, arthritis, or long-term foot pain. Call your doctor if you have one these more serious breaks, which do require treatment: Big toe injury Broken bone sticking out of your skin or causing an open wound (can lead to an infection in your bone) Toe is bent or crooked For a less serious break, even if you put it off at first, call your doctor if you have: An illness that impacts the nerves or blood flow in your feet, like diabetes Fever or chills Intense pain under your toenail (possibly a blood buildup under the nail) Numbness, tingling, or coldness in your toe Pain that gets worse or doesn't get better with over-the-counter pain medicine Blue or gray skin on your toe Swelling, bruising, or redness that doesn't improve after a few days First, your doctor will ask you what happened and what symptoms you're having. He'll check for tenderness and broken skin around your toe. He'll also test your nerves and blood flow. Then, if your doctor thinks it's a break, you'll likely get an X-ray. Treatment depends on where and how bad the break is. In most cases you'll be sent home with directions for self-care. You may also get a prescription for pain medicine. It helps you heal if you can keep your toe from bending too much. Your doctor might suggest buddy taping. That's where you tape your broken toe to the toe next to it. First, you first put cotton or gauze between your toes so the skin doesn't rub and get raw. Then, you wrap them with medical tape. You doctor may also give you a stiff-bottomed shoe with a cloth top. This keeps your toe from bending too much and allows room for swelling. If you broke your toe all the way through and the bone moved, your doctor may need to set it back in place. First, you'll get an injection to numb your toe. Then your doctor moves the bones back together with his hands. There's no surgery involved. You may get a cast if the bone pieces don't stay in place. If you have a wound, you may also get antibiotics and a tetanus shot. If you have blood trapped under your toenail, your doctor will try to drain it, but may have to remove the nail completely. For very severe breaks, you may need surgery to put in pins or screws that hold the bones in place. For the first few days or weeks after you break your toe, you can: Keep your foot raised while sitting or lying down (above your heart is best) to keep the swelling and pain down. Put ice on your toe for 20 minutes every hour while you're awake. That's for the first 24 hours. After that, you can ice it 2 or 3 times a day. Don't put ice right on your skin. Wrap it in a towel instead. Rest. Ease up on activity that causes pain. Take pain medicine with ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen, if you need it. Wear shoes with stiff soles. As you heal, it's best to avoid high heels or any shoes that squeeze your toes. When you can wear shoes and walk without pain, you can ease back into your normal activities. You can expect some stiffness or soreness when you first get going again, but that will fade as you get back to normal."
320,"It's summer, and like many people, maybe you want to celebrate with a picnic. Perhaps some of your favorites -- like fried chicken and deviled eggs â are served. But when you get up the next morning, you feel sick to your stomach and have diarrhea. You might have a salmonella infection. The infection itself is called âsalmonellosis.â But most people know it by the name salmonella, which is actually the name of the bacteria that causes the infection. Along with having the runs when you go to the bathroom, you can also have a fever, along with pain and cramping in your stomach. Most people who get salmonella get better on their own, at home, within 4 to 7 days. There are many possible sources of a salmonella infection. Some of them are: Meat. Some of our favorite proteins to cook and eat have the bacteria. They include: Poultry (chicken, turkey, or duck) Beef and veal Pork Fertilizer. The most common way to get salmonella is by eating meat or eggs or drinking milk that's contaminated. But you can also get it by eating fruits or vegetables that have been in contact with manure from animals that have it. Animal poop is often used in fertilizer for fruits and vegetables, which is how produce such as lettuce, spinach, or strawberries can also be a source of salmonella in people. Water. Produce can be contaminated another way, too. While animal poop is still the culprit, it's not because of manure being put directly on the fields, but contaminated water used to help the produce grow. Cooking. If you cook a lot at home, the way you prepare your food could also be a source of your infection. If you let juices from contaminated chicken or steak come into contact with your lettuce or spinach salad, you could get sick. Handwashing. If you go to the bathroom but don't wash your hands well, you could get an infection. If you change your baby's stinky diaper and forget to wash your hands after, you might contract a salmonella infection, too. Pets. Some that may carry the bacteria include: Dogs Cats Birds Reptiles (such as lizards, snakes, and turtles) You or your child could pet a dog or cat and, without knowing it, touch poop hidden in fur. If you then put your fingers in your mouth, you could get an infection. Salmonella infections (also often referred to, generally, as food poisoning) are quite common. Throughout the world, tens of millions of cases are reported every year. Most people get over it without treatment, but some cases are so severe people need to go to the hospital. In rare cases it's life-threatening. Infections are more common in the summer than the winter â after all, people host more picnics when it's hot than cold. Children are more likely than adults to get an infection. In addition to young children, older adults and people with weak immune systems are most likely to be infected. Most of the symptoms you'll have from a salmonella infection will be stomach-related: Cramps in your stomach Bloody stools Diarrhea Cold and chills Fever Headache Sick to your stomach Throwing up Even though most symptoms usually don't last more than a week, in some cases it can take several months for your bowel movements to get back to normal. A small number of people who get a salmonella infection get pain in their joints. You might hear a doctor or nurse call it reactive arthritis. This can last for several months, or even longer. If you get this joint pain, you also could develop pain while peeing or your eyes could get sore, get itchy, or sting. Dehydration can be problem with this because you've lost too much fluid from having runny and watery poop. Signs of dehydration include: Peeing only in small amounts Dry tongue and mouth Sunken and dry eyes If the salmonella infection gets into your blood, it can infect your body's tissues, such as: The tissues around your brain and spinal cord The lining of your heart or heart valves Your bones or bone marrow The lining of blood vessels These infections can lead to serious diseases. If you have a salmonella infection, it usually goes away on its own after a few days. But if you still are having symptoms more than a week after first getting the infection, you might want to see a doctor. If a young child, older adult, or person with a weakened immune system has an infection, they should see a doctor if they have any of these symptoms for more than a couple of days: Bloody stools Dehydration Ongoing high fever. Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor may want you to have blood tests, or he might want a stool sample. Sometimes, the doctor may want to do further testing to help figure the exact kind of bacteria you have. This can help health officials trace the source if there is an outbreak in your area. For healthy adults: If you have diarrhea with your salmonella infection, you should drink a lot of water and other fluids. Your doctor might suggest you drink a rehydration liquid, like Pedialyte, if your diarrhea is severe. If your doctor confirms that you have a salmonella infection, he might prescribe antibiotics. You need to be sure you finish the prescription and take it exactly as directed. For children: If your child has a healthy immune system, the doctor may not prescribe any treatment, but rather let the infection run its course. But if your kid has a bad fever, you may want to give her acetaminophen ( Tylenol). And, as with adults, she'll need lots of water. In special cases: Infants, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may need antibiotics. Doctors decide this on a case-by-case basis. There are several types of the bacteria that have become resistant, meaning they can't be stopped by antibiotics. Even though salmonella can hide in a variety of foods, you can do a lot of things yourself to help ensure the sneaky bacteria doesn't invade your gut: Avoid eating raw or barely cooked eggs. Don't eat raw or undercooked beef, pork, or poultry. Refrigerate food properly, both before cooking it and after serving it. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water before, and after, handling food. Keep kitchen surfaces clean before preparing food on them. Do not mix cooked food with raw food or use the same utensils to prepare them â for example, don't use the same knife to slice mushrooms that you used to cut raw chicken, and use different plates or cutting boards to slice them on. Cook each kind of meat to its correct minimum temperature. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching animals, their toys, and their bedding. Wash raw fruits and vegetables well, and peel them if possible."
321,"When you have diabetes, taking good care of your feet is very important. Poor foot care can lead to serious problems, including possibly having to remove -- or amputate -- the foot or leg. As a person with diabetes, you are more vulnerable to foot problems, because the disease can damage your nerves and reduce blood flow to your feet. The American Diabetes Association has estimated that one in five people with diabetes who seek hospital care do so for foot problems. By taking proper care of your feet, most serious problems can be prevented. It's important that your doctor check your feet at least once a year for any problems. Here are some diabetes foot care tips to follow. Use mild soaps. Use warm water. Pat your skin dry; do not rub. Thoroughly dry your feet, especially between the toes. After washing, use lotion on your feet to prevent cracking. Do not put lotion between your toes. Check the tops and bottoms of your feet. Have someone else look at your feet if you cannot see them. Check for dry, cracked skin. Look for blisters, cuts, scratches, or other sores. Check for redness, increased warmth, or tenderness when touching any area of your feet. Check for ingrown toenails, corns, and calluses. If you get a blister or sore from your shoes, do not ""pop"" it. Apply a bandage and wear a different pair of shoes. Cut toenails after bathing, when they are soft. Cut toenails straight across and smooth with an emery board. Avoid cutting into the corners of toes. You may want a podiatrist (foot doctor) to cut your toenails. Walk and exercise in comfortable shoes. Do not exercise when you have open sores on your feet. Use this simple test to see if your shoes fit correctly: Stand on a piece of paper. ( Make sure you are standing and not sitting, because your foot changes shape when you stand.) Trace the outline of your foot. Trace the outline of your shoe. Compare the tracings: Is the shoe too narrow? Is your foot crammed into the shoe? The shoe should be at least 1/2 inch longer than your longest toe and as wide as your foot. When choosing the proper footwear if you have diabetes: Buy shoes with closed toes and heels. Buy shoes with leather uppers but without a seam inside. Make sure there is at least 1/2 inch extra space at the end of your longest toe. The inside of the shoe should be soft with no rough areas. The outer sole should be made of stiff material. Your shoe should be at least as wide as your foot. To keep you feet safe if you have diabetes: Don't wait to treat a minor foot problem. Follow your health care provider's guidelines and first aid guidelines. Report foot injuries and infections to your health care provider immediately. Check water temperature with your elbow, not your foot. Do not use a heating pad on your feet. Do not cross your legs. Do not self-treat your corns, calluses, or other foot problems. Go to your health care provider or podiatrist to treat these conditions. See your health care provider if you have diabetes and any of the following problems with your feet: Athlete's foot (cracking between the toes) Sores or wounds on your feet Ingrown toenails Increasing numbness or pain Calluses Redness Blackening of skin Bunions Infection Hammer or mallet toes (when the middle joints of toes are permanently bent downward)"
322,"An abscessed tooth happens when a tooth's root gets infected with bacteria and pus builds up around it. It's also called a periapical abscess. In some cases, the area around the tooth hurts, but not always. If it does, it's usually a sharp, throbbing pain, especially when you put pressure on your tooth. It might also spread to your jaw or other parts of your face on the side that's affected. You also might: Be sensitive to hot or cold temperatures Have puffy gums Notice a bad-smelling odor when you chew with that tooth If you have swelling in your face and a fever, or you have trouble breathing or swallowing, go to the emergency room. The infection may have spread to other parts of your body. This kind of infection usually happens if a cavity doesn't get filled or a tooth is injured. Bacteria can get in through the cavity or a chip or crack in a tooth and spread to the root. You're more likely to have these kinds of issues if you don't brush your teeth at least twice a day or there's a lot of sugar in your diet. Sugary foods and drinks help bacteria grow, and that can lead to cavities and other problems. An abscessed tooth won't go away on its own. See your dentist right away if you have signs of one. It's important to treat it because there's a chance it could spread to your jaw or other parts of your head or neck. This is especially true if your immune system is weak because of a health condition, like HIV or AIDS. Certain medications, including some cancer treatments, can also make it harder for your body to fight off infections. To find out if you have an abscessed tooth, your dentist probably will: Tap on your teeth. If you have an abscess, it'll hurt when he touches the affected tooth. Take an X-ray. This can tell your dentist if you have an abscess and if it has spread to other parts of your mouth."
323,"Alpha, beta, hydroxy acids, vitamins, and derivatives -- the words on skin care products can be confusing. This simple guide will help you understand the ingredients that may benefit your skin. Then, if you're still unsure which skin care products are right for you, ask your dermatologist or consult with a skin aesthetician at your local salon or beauty counter. Alpha-hydroxy acids include glycolic, lactic, tartaric, malic, and citric acids. They have become increasingly popular over the last 20 years. In the U. S. alone, there are over 200 makers of skin care products containing alpha-hydroxy acids. Creams and lotions with alpha-hydroxy acids may help with fine lines, irregular pigmentation, and age spots. Side effects of alpha-hydroxy acids include mild irritation and sun sensitivity. For that reason, sunscreen should be used every morning. To help avoid skin irritation with alpha-hydroxy acids, it's best to start with a product with low concentrations of AHA. Also, give your skin a chance to get used to the product. Start out by applying AHA skin products every other day, gradually working up to a daily application. Don't use too much; follow the instructions on the package. Salicylic acid exfoliates skin, unclogs pores and can improve its texture and color. It also helps with acne. Many skin care products contain salicylic acid. Some are available over-the-counter and others require a doctor's prescription. Studies have shown that salicylic acid is less irritating than skin care products containing alpha-hydroxy acids but has similar results in improving skin texture and color. Warning: People who are allergic to salycylates (found in aspirin) should not use products containing salicylic acid. Salicylic acid can be absorbed into the bloodstream and may cause an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis. Pregnant or nursing women should not use products containing salicylic acid. Skin care products containing hydroquinone are often called bleaching creams or lightening agents. These skin care products are used to lighten hyperpigmentation, such as age spots and dark spots related to pregnancy or hormone therapy (also called melasma). Some over-the-counter skin care products contain hydroquinone. Your doctor can also prescribe a product with a higher concentration of hydroquinone if your skin doesn't respond to over-the-counter treatments. If you are allergic to hydroquinones, you can use products containing kojic acid or niacinamide (vitamin B3) instead. Pregnant women cannot use hydroquinone. Kojic acid is a more recent remedy for treating pigment problems and age spots. First developed in 1989, kojic acid has a similar effect as hydroquinone. Kojic acid is made from a fungus, and studies have shown that it is effective at lightening skin. Retinol is made from vitamin A, and it's in many non-prescription skin care products. Retinol's stronger counterpart is tretinoin, which is the active ingredient in Retin- A and Renova, available by prescription only. If your skin is too sensitive to use Retin- A, retinol is an alternative, although the effects are less impressive. Retinol may improve mottled pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture, and skin tone and color. You may also hear about retinyl palmitate. This is in the same family as retinol, but if the skin care product you choose contains retinyl palmitate, you will need to use more of this product than one that contains retinol to get the same effect. Pregnant women or nursing mothers cannot use retinol. Vitamin C helps to minimize fine lines, scars, and wrinkles. It's the only antioxidant that is proven to boost production of collagen, which is a key part of skin's structure. Be choosy when selecting a vitamin C product. Vitamin C in its most commonly found forms is highly unstable when exposed to oxygen, making it useless. Choose one in a tube or a pump. Also, many topical vitamin C preparations do not penetrate the skin enough to make a difference. If you are considering using a topical vitamin C preparation, ask your dermatologist which product will be the most effective for you. Skin care products containing hyaluronic acid are often used with vitamin C products to assist in effective penetration. Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally (and quite abundantly) in people and animals and is found in young skin, other tissues, and joint fluid. Hyaluronic acid is part of the body's connective tissues, and is known to cushion and lubricate. Aging destroys hyaluronic acid. Diet and smoking can also affect your body's level of hyaluronic acid over time. Skin care products with hyaluronic acid are most frequently used to treat wrinkled skin although they don't replace anything the body has naturally lost. These are very effective moisturizers. Studies have shown that copper peptide promotes the production of collagen and elastin in your skin. It also acts as an antioxidant and promotes production of glycosaminoglycans (such as hyaluronic acid). Studies have also shown that copper-dependent enzymes help firm, smooth, and soften the skin quicker than most other anti-aging skin care products. In addition, copper peptides have been shown to remove damaged collagen and elastin from the skin and scar tissue. Be wary of these claims, however, since the effects on your skin may be far less than is seen in laboratory testing. Alpha-lipoic acid diminishes fine lines, gives skin a healthy glow, and boosts levels of other antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Alpha-lipoic acid can enter all parts of a skin cell. Due to this quality, it is believed that alpha-lipoic acid can provide more protection than other antioxidants against so-called free radicals that can damage skin. The brain makes DMAE. DMAE in skin care products shows minimal effects at best when applied on skin for the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles."
324,"When you're constipated, your body isn't able to get rid of waste like it needs to. Having it every once in a while is common, but if you're dealing with symptoms for more than 3 months, your constipation is chronic. And that raises your chance of having complications. The problems most often happen in the places where stool leaves your body. When you're constipated, you're more likely to push hard to try to go. That can make the veins around your rectum and anus swell. These swollen veins are called hemorrhoids, or piles. They're like varicose veins around your anus. They can be external, which means they're under the skin around the anus, or internal, which means they're in the lining of your anus or rectum. Hemorrhoids can itch and be painful. They can cause bleeding when you have a bowel movement. You may see streaks of blood on your toilet paper when you wipe. Sometimes blood can pool inside a hemorrhoid, which can cause a painful, hard lump. You may also get skin tags, blood clots, or infections from your hemorrhoids. Passing hard stools or straining to pass stools can tear the tissue around your anus. These tears are anal fissures. They cause itching, pain, and bleeding. Because the symptoms of anal fissures make going to the bathroom more difficult, they can make constipation worse. This happens often in children who hold in their stool out of fear of the pain. The tears are usually very small. But sometimes they can grow larger and affect the ring of muscle at the opening of your anus that keeps it closed. This kind of anal fissure is harder to heal. You may need medication or surgery to fix the problem. Once you've had an anal fissure, you're more likely to get another one. When you can't get stool out of your body, it can start to stick together in your intestines. The hardened mass gets stuck and causes a blockage. The squeezing your colon normally uses to push stool out of your body can't move it because it's too large and hard. It can cause pain and vomiting. You may even have to go to the emergency room for treatment. Children and older adults are more likely to have fecal impaction. Your rectum, the final part of your large intestine, ends at your anus. When you're constantly straining to pass stools, it can stretch and slip outside your body. Sometimes just part of the rectum comes out, but sometimes the whole thing does. It can be painful and may cause bleeding. It can sometimes be hard to tell if you have rectal prolapse or hemorrhoids, since both cause bulging out of the anus, but they're two different conditions that need to be treated differently."
325,"Everyone feels fatigued sometimes, and many people feel fatigued a lot of the time. But, chronic fatigue syndrome isn't just being tired. It's a new state of fatigue that has lasted for at least 6 months, and that can be so severe that it gets in the way of your normal daily activities, at home and at work. Rest and sleep don't seem to help. If you have it, physical activity can leave you feeling worse, typically the next day, a condition called post-exertional malaise. You tend to awaken almost every morning feeling as if you did not get enough sleep, and often you wake up a lot at night, for no apparent reason. You can have trouble concentrating and multi-tasking. When you stand upright from a sitting or lying position, you can feel lightheaded, and your heart can beat rapidly. After you are on your feet for a while, you can feel terrible, and need to lie down flat. Chronic fatigue syndrome is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME/ CFS). It tends to cycle through flareups and remissions, good days and bad days, although on the good days you are not back to normal. There isn't any known cure, but different treatments can help the symptoms. The CDC estimates up to 2.5 million Americans have ME/ CFS. Anyone can get it, including children and teens. It is most common in women in their 40s and 50s. Women are more likely to develop it than men. Most cases are mild or moderate. About 1 in 4 people with the condition have severe symptoms. If you have mild chronic fatigue syndrome, you can probably manage on your own. Moderate symptoms can make it hard for you to move around. For example, you might need to sleep in the afternoons. If your symptoms are severe, the impact on your quality of life and abilities can be as bad as if you had lupus, heart disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors don't know the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome, but they have identified different underlying abnormalities in people with the condition. Immune system problems: Several different parts of the immune system are different in people with chronic fatigue syndrome, and some research indicates that these abnormalities may cause the symptoms of the illness. However, fortunately, people with chronic fatigue syndrome do not have a defective immune system, in the way that people with HIV/ AIDS do. Energy production: In people with chronic fatigue syndrome, the cells in the body have trouble making enough energy. Brain abnormalities: Abnormalities are seen in pictures of the brain (like MRI or CT scans), in levels of brain hormones, and in the electrical system of the brain (brain waves). These abnormalities can come and go, and are not necessarily permanent. Blood pressure and pulse issues: On standing, people can have a drop in blood pressure and an increase in how fast the heart beats. Sometimes people feel like fainting or actually faint, if the blood pressure drops too low. Genes: Some studies have found abnormalities in the structure of certain genes. Other studies have found abnormalities in how some genes are turned on and off, inside cells. Studies of identical and non-identical twins indicate that some people inherit a genetic susceptibility to getting the illness. Infections or other illness: Chronic fatigue syndrome often, but not always, begins with a sudden infectious-like illness (fever, sore throat, aching muscles, upset stomach). Research has found that several different types of infectious agents can trigger the beginning of the illness, including Epstein- Barr virus (a common cause of mononucleosis), Lyme disease bacteria and Q fever bacteria. Serotonin and cortisol: Several studies indicate that serotonin, a major brain chemical, is important in the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. People with the illness have low levels of cortisol, a hormone that the body releases in response to stress. The National Academy of Medicine has issued guidelines describing the combination of symptoms necessary for doctors to diagnose the condition. Unfortunately, there is not yet a diagnostic test that is sufficiently accurate to be useful. Because extreme fatigue is a symptom of so many conditions, your doctor will want to rule out other conditions first, before considering a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. You'll need to get a complete checkup and talk with your doctor about all your symptoms."
326,"Generally, you want a slow heart rate when you're resting. It's a sign of good health. But if it's too slow, it could be a symptom of a condition called bradycardia. Normally, your heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute when you're at rest. But with bradycardia, it goes down to less than 60 beats a minute. This might not cause a problem for some people. But it could be a clue that you have an issue with the electrical system in your heart. You need to see a doctor who can figure out why it's beating slowly and if you should get treatment. Electrical signals travel through the heart's four chambers -- two on the top called the atria and below them, the two ventricles. These signals prompt it to beat in a steady rhythm. But pulses don't always fire off as they should. This creates what's called arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats. Some conditions cause the heart to beat too fast or to flutter. With bradycardia, it's the opposite. The electrical problem slows down the time in between heartbeats. You may simply have a slower-than-normal heart rate that doesn't cause any symptoms. The electrical activity may be working fine, just a little slower than it does in most people. You wouldn't even be diagnosed with this condition. And even with bradycardia, you may never notice any symptoms or need treatment. But that's not always the case. The biggest concern is your heart isn't doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: Lightheadedness or dizziness Confusion or a hard time concentrating Fainting Shortness of breath (with or without chest pain) You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity. If you check your heart rate and it's regularly below 60 beats per minute, be aware of those symptoms. If you have no other symptoms, you probably don't need to see a doctor right away. You may exercise a lot, and a slow heart rate could be a sign of how fit you are. But, bring it up at your next appointment. If you or a loved one notices mild to medium symptoms, go to a doctor quickly. If you or a loved one faints, has chest pains or trouble breathing, call 911. Tiredness, trouble concentrating, or breathing harder may just seem like part of growing older. But sometimes it's more than that. Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms. If you wear out more easily now than you did a month or year ago, let her know. The chances of getting bradycardia increase as you get older, though that's true of most heart conditions. Smoking, drug abuse, and high blood pressure also make it more likely. The causes of bradycardia can vary greatly from one person to the next. The abnormal rhythm can show up after a heart attack or as a side effect of heart surgery. Other things that can lead to it: Certain medications, such as those to treat high blood pressure and other arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats A congenital defect, or problem you're born with Thyroid disease, an imbalance of hormones in the body Obstructive sleep apnea , when your breathing pauses many times throughout the night Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it's not always present all the time. Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you're having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it's a way to measure your heart's electrical system. If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you've had. If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism, or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug. If these approaches don't work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker. A surgeon will put this small device into your chest. It has thin, flexible wires, called leads, which extend to the heart. They carry small electrical charges that help keep the heart pumping at a steady rate. There are no surefire ways to stop bradycardia from happening, but if you are active and eat well on a low-sodium diet, you may reduce your chances of getting it. Other things that help: Stay at a good weight for you Manage your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar If you smoke, try to quit If you have been given a pacemaker, listen your doctor's instructions about how it operates and any signs it might not be working."
327,"Alzheimer's disease often begins with memory loss. But over time, it can lead to other mental, emotional, and physical problems. You'll want to know what to expect and be ready with solutions that will help your loved one with Alzheimer's if they have any of the following issues. People with the disease may act anxious or get upset easily. When they feel this way, they may fidget, shout, throw things, or even try to hit other people. To help them: Keep his surroundings quiet. Background noise, like sounds from the TV, can upset or confuse him. Settle into a routine. Changes in his environment or his daily routine, such as travel or visits from guests, can make him agitated. Check for things that physically bother him. Pain, fatigue, or needing to use the restroom could make him unsettled or trigger an outburst. Stay calm. If he gets upset or angry, don't argue with him or criticize. Try to keep your voice even and your emotions steady. People with Alzheimer's may have trouble controlling their bathroom needs. That's especially true as the disease gets worse. To prevent and manage accidents: Take your loved one to the restroom every few hours. Be aware of signs he needs to go, including fidgeting and clutching clothing. When you're away from home, know where the restrooms are. Encourage him to drink less as it gets closer to bedtime. It's understandable, and common, for someone with Alzheimer's to feel depressed, especially soon after he learns he has the disease. Antidepressant drugs may help. Other things that also help include: Regular exercise Spending more time around other people Staying busy with hobbies and activities he enjoys The disease causes coordination problems that make people more likely to lose their balance and fall. To help prevent that: Encourage regular exercise, especially early in the disease, to help your loved one keep up their balance and strength. Remove objects that are easy to trip on, such as loose rugs or extension cords. Make sure stairways have at least one handrail. Place non-skid strips in the bathtub and on smooth floors. Install night-lights. Place easy-to-see stickers on large windows and sliding-glass doors to make it obvious that something solid is there. People in the later stages of Alzheimer's are more likely to get infections, including bladder infections, flu, and pneumonia. To lower your loved one's chances of getting sick: Talk to his doctor about getting a flu shot each year. A one-time pneumonia shot after age 65 is also a good idea. Watch for sudden changes in symptoms or behaviors, or a fever. These can point to an infection. People with Alzheimer's may feel drowsy during the day but have trouble sleeping through the night. Take these steps to help your loved one get some rest: Stick to a schedule. Keep him on a routine for bedtime, waking up, and meals. No naps. Save sleeping for nighttime. Get outside. Spend time outdoors, especially in bright sunlight early in the day. This can lead to better sleep at night. Avoid ""sleep wreckers."" Urge him to quit caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. Check medications. Ask his doctor or pharmacist if any of his prescriptions could affect sleep. In the later stages of the disease, memory problems and confusion may give your loved one sudden urges to wander away from home. If he leaves home alone, he could be in danger. To prevent wandering: Make doors hard to open. You may need to place locks higher on doors. Put alarms on doors so they sound an alert when they're opened. Keep car keys hidden. Have him wear an ID bracelet, just in case he does wander and needs help finding his way home."
328,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS, is a condition that causes fluid to leak into your lungs, blocking oxygen from getting to your organs. It is serious, sometimes life-threatening, and can get worse quickly. But it's generally treatable and most people can recover from it. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important -- your organs need enough oxygen to work right and keep you going. Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and builds up in the tiny air sacs in your lungs. Your lungs are then unable to fill up with enough air. Because of this, the blood traveling to your lungs can't pick up the amount of oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. That can lead to organs such as your kidneys or brain not working as they should or shutting down. Doctors aren't sure why some people get ARDS and others don't. Doctors are still trying to learn more about this condition and why it happens. It's not always clear what triggers a case. Most people who get ARDS are already in the hospital for something else. That's because it's usually caused by an injury or another illness. Some of the causes of ARDS may include: Sepsis: This is when you get an infection in your bloodstream, and your immune system goes into overdrive, causing inflammation, small blood clots, and bleeding. Accidents: Injuries from a car wreck or a fall can damage your lungs or that part of your brain that handles breathing. Breathing in harmful substances: Dense smoke or chemical fumes can trigger ARDS. Some of the other possible causes of ARDS include: Pneumonia Bleeding that requires a blood transfusion Inflammation of the pancreas Overdosing on cocaine and other drugs Near drowning Burns ARDS makes it hard to breathe and puts great strain on the lungs. So symptoms include shortness of breath, often severe. Other signs of ARDS include: Low blood pressure Unusually fast breathing Confusion and exhaustion Blue-tinted lips or nails from lack of oxygen in the blood Dizziness Lots of sweating While many people are already in a hospital when they get ARDS, you should get medical treatment at once if you have these symptoms or see them in a loved one. No one test can identify a case of ARDS. It's more of a puzzle that a doctor has to piece together. Other conditions can have similar symptoms. To make a diagnosis, you doctor will probably begin by asking about your medical history. She'll then likely do a physical exam and listen to your breathing and your heartbeat. She may also look for: Signs of extra fluid in your body Bluish color on your lips or skin There are various tests your doctor might order to help her reach a diagnosis. Some of them include: Scans: A chest X-ray is crucial and probably the first test your doctor will order. You might also get a computerized tomography ( CT) scan. These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is located. Blood tests: These can be used to check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia. Heart tests: These might be ordered to rule out things such as heart failure (when your heart doesn't pump blood to your body properly). Treatment aims to get oxygen levels in your blood back up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. Doctors might start with an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), depending on exactly what you need. Other treatments might include: Nutrition and medicine through IV fluids Medicine to prevent bleeding and blood clots Medicine to keep you calm and comfortable People with ARDS are treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital. People who respond to treatment usually have a full recovery with no long-term harm. Most people with ARDS can recover. If you've recently had it, you can improve your recovery by: Quitting smoking Not drinking alcohol Getting a flu shot every year and a pneumonia vaccine every five years Some might need to be on a ventilator for a while, but most won't. You might be weak after ARDS and need physical therapy. Finally, ARDS can be tough emotionally and physically on patients and families. Join a support group if you need help with anxiety, stress, or depression."
329,"Mycoplasma genitalium ( MG) is a type of bacteria that can cause an STD. You get it by having sex with someone who has it. Even if you don't go âall the wayâ with vaginal sex, you can get MG through sexual touching or rubbing. Scientists have known about this bacteria since the 1980s, but a recent study showed that more than 1 in 100 adults might have it. MG doesn't always cause symptoms, so it's possible to have it and not know it. In men, the symptoms are: Watery discharge from your penis Burning, stinging, or pain when you pee The symptoms for women are: Discharge from your vagina Pain during sex Bleeding after sex Bleeding between periods Pain in your pelvic area below your belly button Unlike other STDs, there is no test for MG that the FDA has approved. But if you or your doctor think you might have it, you can get a nucleic acid amplification test ( NAAT). For this test, you might have to give a sample of your pee. Your doctor might also use a swab to take a sample from your vagina, cervix, or urethra, the tube that carries your pee out of your body. MG can cause a number of complications: A problem that makes your urethra irritated, swollen, and itchy, called urethritis. It can happen to men and women. An infection of a woman's reproductive organs, called pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID), which can make it hard to get pregnant. An inflamed cervix, called cervicitis Scientists aren't sure if an MG infection can make it hard for men to get a woman pregnant. MG can be a tricky problem to treat. Common antibiotics like penicillin kill bacteria by damaging a germ's cell walls. But MG bacteria don't have cell walls, so these drugs don't work very well. Your doctor might try azithromycin ( Zithromax, Zmax) first. If that doesn't work, your doctor might give you moxifloxacin ( Avelox). After a month, you can get another test to make sure the infection is gone, but it's not a good idea to get routine tests if you don't have symptoms from MG. If you still have symptoms and you still have the disease, you'll need to get more treatment. Your doctor might also focus on treating the other conditions MG can cause, like urethritis, PID, or cervicitis. Your sex partners should talk to their doctors about getting tested and treated and so they don't infect other people or give it back to you. You can still get MG again even when you've already had treatment for it. Condoms can reduce your chance of getting MG, but they can't guarantee you won't get it. If you have the disease, avoid having sex for 7 days after you start treatment so you don't infect others."

But it takes more than just eating low-fat foods to lose weight. You must also watch how many calories you eat. Remember, your body stores extra calories as fat, even if they come from fat-free, trans fat-free, and low-fat foods. If you replace high-fat foods with high-calorie foods, like sweets, you'll likely gain weight rather than lose weight. To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat. You can do that by exercising more and by eating less fat and fewer calories. Experts recommend that most adults get 20%-35% of their daily calories from fat. That's about 44 to 77 grams of fat a day if you eat 2,000 calories a day. Read nutrition labels on food packages. Nutrition labels show the number of grams of fat per serving and calories per serving. Eat a variety of lower-fat foods to get all the nutrients you need. Eat plenty of plant foods (such as whole-grains, fruits, and vegetables) and a moderate amount of lean and low-fat, animal-based food (meat and dairy products) to help control your fat, cholesterol, carbs, and calories. When you're shopping, choose lean meats, fish, and poultry. Limit these to 5-7 ounces per day. Other good low-fat sources of protein include dried beans and peas, tofu, low-fat yogurt, low-fat or skim milk, low-fat cheese, and tuna packed in water. Choose foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, flaxseed, and walnuts for heart health. The American Heart Association recommends eating fatty fish such as salmon twice weekly for the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. Trim all visible fat and remove the skin from poultry. Refrigerate soups, gravies, and stews, and remove the hardened fat on top before eating. Bake, broil, or grill meats on a rack that allows fat to drip from the meat. Don't fry foods. Sprinkle lemon juice, herbs, and spices on cooked vegetables instead of using cheese, butter, or cream-based sauces. Try plain, nonfat or low-fat yogurt and chives on baked potatoes rather than sour cream. Reduced-fat sour cream still has fat, so limit the amount you use. Choose simply prepared foods such as broiled, roasted, or baked fish or chicken. Avoid fried or sautÃ©ed foods, casseroles, and foods with heavy sauces or gravies. Ask that your food be cooked without added butter, margarine, gravy, or sauce. If you're ordering salad, ask for low-fat dressing on the side. Select fruit, angel food cake, nonfat frozen yogurt, sherbet, or sorbet for dessert instead of ice cream, cake, or pie."
331,"Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. They can pop up anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. It usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, it can cover large parts of the body. The rashes can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. Psoriasis starts as small, red bumps, which grow bigger and form scales. The skin appears thick but may bleed easily if you pick or rub off the scales. Rashes may itch and skin may become cracked and painful . Nails may form pits, thicken, crack and become loose. If you have a rash that isn't healing, see your doctor. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Some things that can trigger outbreaks are: Cuts, scrapes, or surgery Emotional stress Strep infections Luckily, there are many treatments. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis; available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) Vitamin D cream (a strong kind ordered by your doctor; vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, and gels are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. Cyclosporine. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure though, so your doctor will closely watch your heath while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is over-active in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), and ustekinumab ( Stelara). Enzyme Inhibitor. The medication apremilast ( Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that works by blocking a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases. Recent studies have suggested that when you better control the inflammation of psoriasis, the risk of heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases associated with inflammation also decrease."
332,"Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it. There are several causes of this disease, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Bacterial meningitis can be life-threatening and spreads between people in close contact with each other. Viral meningitis tends to be less severe, and most people recover completely without treatment. Fungal meningitis is a rare form of the disease. It usually happens only in people whose immune system -- the body's defense against germs -- has been weakened. Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days and may include: Confusion Fever Headache Numbness in your face Sensitivity to light Stiff neck so that you can't lower your chin to your chest Upset stomach or vomiting Meningitis is almost always caused by a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, like your ears, sinuses, or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include: Autoimmune disorders Cancer medications Syphilis Tuberculosis It's an extremely serious illness. You or your child will need to get medical help right away. It can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage unless you get quick treatment. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Several kinds of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common ones in the U. S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Experts recommend that all children get them, as well as all adults who are at a higher risk for the disease. In many cases, bacterial meningitis starts when bacteria get into your bloodstream from your sinuses, ears, or throat. The bacteria travel through your bloodstream to your brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze. If you or your child has been around someone who has bacterial meningitis, ask your doctor what steps you should take to avoid catching it. Viral meningitis is more common than the bacterial form and generally -- but not always -- less serious. A number of viruses can trigger the disease, including several that can cause diarrhea. Fungal meningitis is much less common than the bacterial or viral forms. Healthy people rarely get it. Someone with a problem with their immune system -- because they have AIDS, for example -- is more likely to become infected with this form of meningitis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam, including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. They will also need to do tests that can include: Blood tests to find bacteria CT or MRI scans of your head to find swelling or inflammation Spinal tap, in which a health care worker uses a needle to take fluid from around your spinal cord. It can tell what's causing your meningitis. Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs immediate treatment with antibiotics. Your doctor might give you a general, or broad-spectrum, antibiotic even before they've found the exact bacteria that caused your illness and then change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find. You might also get corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have fever or aches. If a virus like herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows that it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults ages 16-25 Adults over 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen, long-term disease, or immune system disorders. Because certain germs that cause meningitis can spread easily, outbreaks are most likely to happen in places where people live close to each other. College students in dorms or military recruits in barracks can be more likely to catch the disease. So are people who travel to areas where meningitis is more common, such as parts of Africa."
333,"When your rheumatoid arthritis flares up, it's important to prevent damage to your joints. Watch for signs of trouble and learn the steps to stay healthy. If you have swelling and stiffness every day, you're more likely to have damage than someone who has these symptoms less often. You can get damage even if you don't feel pain, but swelling in your joint is a reliable sign. So is a feeling of tenderness when you press on it. Also, pay attention to how long your joints feel stiff in the morning. Ask yourself when you get up, "" How long does it take until I'm feeling as loose as I'll feel for the day?"" The longer you feel stiff, the more likely it is that your RA is active. Another sign you can look for is something called a ""boggy"" joint. When your joint lining starts to have problems, it may give your joint a mushy texture. This may continue even when you don't have a flare. See your rheumatologist if you notice this happening. Because treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has improved over the years, many experts believe that most people who now have it will get less joint damage than ever before. Take these steps to improve your odds of avoiding long-term trouble. Get treated early. Much of the damage that eventually becomes serious starts soon after you learn you have RA. The earlier you start treatment, the less your chances of problems. See your doctor often. You'll have less damage if you see your rheumatologist several times a year. Exercise. It makes your joints stronger. Your doctor or physical therapist will help you make a plan that's safe and fits your fitness level. Rest when you need to. You need to find a balance between downtime and exercise. Make sure you don't overdo it when you work out. Use a cane in the hand opposite a painful hip or knee. It curbs wear-and-tear on your joints. If you smoke, quit. Talk to you doctor to get advice on how to end your tobacco habit."
334,"Before you use eye drops, wash your hands with soap and warm water. Dry them with a clean towel. To put them in your own eyes, lie down or use a mirror. It may help to ask someone to check that the drops get in your eye. Look up to the ceiling with both eyes. Tilt your head back and pull your lower lid down with one hand. Hold the bottle or tube in your other hand. If you need to, rest part of your hand on your forehead to keep it steady. Place one drop or a little ointment inside your lower lid. Don't let the tip of the bottle or tube touch your eye. Blink and dab away any extra fluid with a tissue. If you have both drops and ointment, use the drops first. If you don't, the ointment may keep the eye drops from being absorbed. If you have more than one type of drop, wait about 5 minutes after the first medicine before you use the second. Keep your eyes closed for a few minutes. That lets the medicine get inside your eye. Wash your hands as soon as you're done to remove any medication still there. If you have any questions, talk to your eye doctor."
335,"If you have diastolic heart failure, your left ventricle has become stiffer than normal. Because of that, your heart can't relax the way it should. When it pumps, it can't fill up with blood as it's supposed to. Because there's less blood in the ventricle, less blood is pumped out to your body. As we get older, our heart and blood vessels become less elastic. That makes them more likely to get stiff. So diastolic heart failure is more common as people get older. Other than normal aging, the most common causes are: High blood pressure : If you have it, your heart has to work harder to pump more blood through your body. Thanks to that extra work, your heart muscle may get thicker or larger, and it eventually gets stiff. Diabetes : The disease can cause the wall of your heart to thicken. That makes it stiffen. Coronary artery disease : The amount of blood flowing to your heart muscle is blocked or less than normal. Obesity/inactivity: With either, your heart has to work much harder to pump blood. Common signs of heart failure can include: Shortness of breath Tiredness, weakness Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, or abdomen Lasting cough or wheezing Fast or irregular heartbeat Dizziness, confusion Having to pee more often at night Nausea, lack of appetite To figure out if you have heart failure, your doctor will examine you, ask about your medical history, and run some tests. Those tests might include: An echocardiogram to check for diastolic dysfunction Blood tests Electrocardiogram ( EKG) Chest X-ray Exercise test (stress test) Heart catheterization Although diastolic heart failure can't be cured, treatment can help ease symptoms and improve the way your heart pumps. Your plan can include: Lifestyle changes: Your doctor will probably suggest: A heart-healthy diet Regular exercise Work to get to a healthy weight You quit smoking Medication: You may need to take one or more drugs as part of your treatment. Common heart failure medications for diastolic heart failure include: Diuretics, which help ease swelling Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, a type of diuretic to get rid of extra salt and fluid but help the body keep potassium High blood pressure medication"

Heartburn usually is described as a burning pain in the middle of the chest. It may start high in the abdomen or may extend up the neck or back. Sometimes the pain may be sharp or pressure-like, rather than burning. Such pain can mimic heart pain (angina). Typically, heartburn related to GERD is seen more commonly after a meal. Other symptoms of GERD include: Hoarseness; if acid reflux gets past the upper esophageal sphincter, it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx), causing hoarseness or sore throat. Laryngitis Chronic dry cough, especially at night; GERD is a common cause of unexplained coughing. It is not clear how cough is caused or aggravated by GERD.

337,"Marijuana, both for recreation and medical use, is becoming legal in more states. Even as more people use it, health experts aren't sure whether smoking pot raises your odds of getting lung cancer. Here's what researchers know -- and don't know -- about the connection. The link between tobacco smoke and lung cancer is well-known. Studies show that marijuana smoke has many of the same harmful substances as tobacco, and often more of them. Among the hazards are: Benzo(a)pyrene Benz(a)anthracene Phenols Vinyl chlorides Nitrosamines Reactive oxygen species People also smoke marijuana in a different way than tobacco, possibly posing greater danger to the lungs: You usually inhale marijuana smoke deeply and hold it in, which gives the toxins more contact with your lung tissue and more chance to stick there. You generally a smoke a joint all the way to the end. Tar, the sticky stuff left after burning, has high levels of harmful substances, and it's concentrated at the end of a joint. When scientists looked at lung tissue of some people who smoked weed regularly, they found changes that are known to signal the future growth of cancer. Given what scientists already know, why is it so hard to say how smoking pot affects your chances of getting lung cancer? Studies that have looked for a direct link between the two have conflicting results -- some found evidence that ties marijuana to lung cancer, while other data show little to no connection. The topic is also tough to investigate. Scientists say a few factors limit how reliable the research is. Most of the research on marijuana dates to when it was still widely illegal. It's hard to gather information about behavior that's against the law. Most studies have asked people to report how often they smoked marijuana, and researchers know that these kinds of surveys, called âself-reported,â aren't as reliable as when they collect data in other ways. That's because people don't remember their behavior perfectly or might underestimate or conceal how often they do something that others think is wrong. Illegal marijuana, unlike tobacco, doesn't have any controls on its strength or quality. People don't use the same amount in one âdose.â That makes it hard for researchers to set standards to measure its effects. Another problem is that many people who smoke marijuana also smoke tobacco, sometimes mixed in the same cigarette. So if they get lung cancer, it's impossible to sort out what substance caused it. Some marijuana smokers in the studies have been fairly young, which could skew the results. Cancers can take time to grow. On the other hand, most people who use weed don't smoke as much as a tobacco user, which could lower their odds for a problem. Animal research suggests that some chemicals in marijuana work against tumor growth, which could explain why lung cancer isn't showing up as often as scientists might expect in people who smoke it. The studies on this are in their early days, and researchers need to take a deeper look into this theory. Now that marijuana is legal in more places, growers are making the product more standard and stronger. More people are smoking pot, too. Any link between marijuana smoking and lung cancer isn't clear now, but researchers have a chance to move beyond some of the problems that have made studies unclear in the past."
338,"A mastectomy is a way to treat breast cancer by surgically removing a breast and sometimes nearby tissues. In the past, a radical mastectomy with complete removal of the breast, lymph nodes in the underarm, and some chest muscles under the breasts, was the standard treatment for breast cancer. But surgical breakthroughs over the past 2 decades have given women more options than ever before. Less invasive breast-conserving treatments are available to many women. The type of mastectomy that's right for you depends on several things, including: Your age General health Menopause status Tumor size Tumor stage (how far it's spread) Tumor grade (its aggressiveness) Tumor's hormone receptor status Whether or not lymph nodes are involved With this procedure, also called simple mastectomy, your doctor removes your entire breast, including the nipple. Your lymph nodes, the small glands that are part of your immune system, may sometimes be removed from your underarm. You're most likely to have a total mastectomy if the cancer has not spread beyond the breast or if you're having a preventative mastectomy to lower your risk of getting breast cancer. Women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a preventive mastectomy, also called prophylactic mastectomy. Studies show that women with a high risk of breast cancer may be as much as 90% less likely to get the disease after preventive mastectomy. Usually, a total mastectomy -- removing the entire breast and nipple -- is recommended. In some cases, women have both breasts removed. This is called a double mastectomy. Some women who've had breast cancer in one breast will decide to have a preventive mastectomy to remove the other breast. This can reduce the chance of cancer reoccurrence. If you plan to have breast reconstruction, it can be done at the time of the preventive mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or at a later time (delayed reconstruction). During breast reconstruction, the surgeon may use synthetic implants or tissue flaps from another part of your body to create a breas Women with stage I or stage II breast cancer may have this procedure. It's is a breast-conserving method in which the tumor and the tissue surrounding it are all that's removed. The surgery is often followed by radiation therapy to the remaining breast tissue. With radiation therapy, powerful X-rays target the breast tissue. The radiation kills cancer cells and prevents them from spreading, or reoccurring. There are two kinds: A lumpectomy removes the tumor and a small cancer-free area of tissue surrounding the tumor. A quadrantectomy removes the tumor and more of the breast tissue than a lumpectomy. In some cases, more surgery is required after a partial mastectomy. Sometimes, if cancer cells are still in breast tissue, it may be necessary to remove the entire breast. A radical mastectomy is the complete removal of the breast, including the nipple. The surgeon also removes the overlying skin, the muscles beneath the breast, and the lymph nodes. Because radical mastectomy typically isn't more effective than less extreme forms of mastectomy, it's rarely performed today. It's only recommended when the cancer has spread to the chest muscle. A less traumatic and more widely used procedure is the modified radical mastectomy ( MRM). With the modified radical mastectomy, the doctor removes your entire breast along with the underarm lymph nodes. Your chest muscles are left intact but the skin covering your chest wall may or may not be. You might get breast reconstruction afterward. The doctor removes breast tissue, the nipple, and the areola but saves most of the skin over the breast. It's only used when breast reconstruction follows immediately after a mastectomy. It may not be a good choice if your tumors are large or near the skin surface. You might also hear it called a total skin-sparing mastectomy. The doctor removes all the breast tissue, including the ducts going all the way up to the nipple and areola. But he saves the skin of the nipple and areola and cuts out tissues under and around them. If these areas are cancer-free, they can be saved. This method also calls for reconstruction right after the mastectomy. Prior to surgery: First, you'll change into a hospital gown. You'll wait in a preoperative holding area. After you get changed, your friends and family can visit, usually a couple at a time. A nurse might use a felt-tip marker to draw on your breast where the incision will be. You'll get anesthesia. The nurse will put a needle connected to a long tube of medication into your hand and tape it in place and you'll start to relax. Once you're in the operating room: You'll probably be there for 2-3 hours -- more if you're getting reconstruction afterward. The doctor makes an incision and separates breast tissue to be removed from the skin above and muscle below it. If you're getting sentinel node dissection or axillary lymph node dissection, those procedures take place next. If you're getting reconstruction, the plastic surgeon takes over. If not, your breast surgeon will place drains into your breast and armpit prevent fluid from collecting where the tumor was. The surgeon stitches up the incision and covers the site with a bandage that wraps around your chest. Once the surgery is over: You'll go to a recovery room where staff can keep an eye on your heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. After you wake up, you'll be admitted to a hospital room. You'll probably stay around 1-2 days, though it might be longer if you have reconstruction. Someone from your health care team will talk to you about: Medications. You'll find out about the pain meds you have and how to take them. How to care for: The incision. The bandage will probably stay in until your first follow-up visit. Drains. Sometimes they come out before you leave the hospital, but they might stay in until your first follow-up visit. Stitches. Yours will probably dissolve on their own, but non-dissolving types and staples will be removed at your follow-up visit. Complications. You'll need to know how to spot signs of infection and lymphedema, swelling that often follows lymph node removal. Exercises. They'll help prevent stiffness on the side where you had surgery. You'll probably start the morning after surgery. When you can wear a prosthesis or bra. Your surgery site needs to heal first. You'll find out how long you have to wait. Once you're home, make sure you follow the plan your doctor gave you. Also make sure that you: Rest. Get plenty of it the first few weeks after surgery. It takes a lot out of you. Take your meds. Don't tough it out. Take the medication as prescribed. You'll probably feel a mix of pain and numbness. Keep the site dry. Take sponge baths only (no tub baths or showers) until your drains and stitches are out. Do your exercises. They'll keep your arm from getting stiff. Ask for help. Don't be shy. It takes time to get better. Get all the help you can with meal prep, shopping, housework, childcare, pet care, rides to doctors' appointments, and whatever else you aren't ready to take on by yourself."
339,"So, your dog has diabetes. Take a deep breath. With good care, your companion can lead a long, healthy life. Like humans, when dogs have diabetes, staying trim is key. If your dog is overweight, losing some pounds can help his cells better use insulin, a hormone that keeps blood sugar levels in check. That makes it easier for his body to turn food into fuel. The goal for any pooch with diabetes is to keep blood sugar (or glucose) levels as close to normal as possible. This helps your dog feel good and makes it less likely he'll get diabetes-related complications, such as vision-clouding cataracts and urinary tract infections. Your veterinarian will determine how many calories your dog needs every day, based on his weight and activity level. Once you know that number, it's important to keep a close eye on what he eats and how much. Researchers are still exploring what diet is best for dogs with diabetes. Most vets recommend a high-fiber, low-fat diet. Fiber slows the entrance of glucose into the bloodstream and helps your dog feel full. Low-fat foods have fewer calories. Together, the diet can help your dog eat less and lose weight. But make sure your pooch drinks plenty of water. Fiber takes water from the body, and that can cause constipation and other problems. Most dogs do fine with food you can buy at the store. But your vet may recommend prescription dog food or a homemade diet developed by a veterinary nutritionist. Your vet can tell you the best way to go about changing your dog's food. Even the best diet won’t help if your dog doesn’t eat it, though -- and you can't give insulin to a dog on an empty stomach. It can make him very sick. If your dog isn't eating as much, it could be because he doesn't like the food. It could also mean he has another problem, or that he's having diabetes-related complications. Talk with your vet. Make sure your dog eats something -- even if that something isn’t ideal. But steer clear of soft, semi-moist dog foods in packets, which are typically high in sugar. With your vet’s OK, here’s how you can entice your pup to eat: Stir a tablespoon of canned food into his regular food. Scatter shredded chicken or scrambled eggs into kibble. Add a tablespoon of low-sodium chicken broth to dry food. Treats between meals are OK, as long as they’re low in sugar and carbohydrates. Avoid snacks that list syrup, molasses, fructose, dextrose, or maltose on the ingredients label. Homemade dehydrated meats, carrots, snap peas, and even canned pumpkin are good options. Balancing insulin and food is like a relay race. The body constantly processes food and insulin between meals and injections. Most dogs do best on a regular schedule of 2-3 meals a day. As a general rule, injections should be given every 12 hours. Talk to your vet about getting your dog on the right schedule. Regular exercise will also help your pooch lose weight and lower blood sugar levels. It’s best to have your dog exercise for the same length of time and at the same intensity every day. An unusually long or vigorous workout could cause blood sugar levels to drop too low. Planning a tough hike? Talk to your vet about adjusting your dog’s insulin first. It can take a few months to get to “cruise control,” so try not to worry if your pup’s blood sugar levels aren’t under control quickly. Also, losing weight may lessen your dog’s need for insulin, so check his levels often. Caring for a dog with diabetes can be hard at first. But soon the changes will become part of your daily life. The extra care and attention you'll give him may even strengthen your bond."
340,"You breathe in and out thousands of times a day and rarely give it a thought -- until it starts to feel hard. Breathing problems can happen for many reasons, like being out of shape, congestion, fever, or asthma. But in some cases, they're a sign that something is wrong with your heart. Whatever the reason, always take breathing issues seriously. Tell your doctor so he can help you figure out the cause. And if your problem is sudden and severe, you should get medical help right away. Heart failure (sometimes called congestive heart failure). Even though âfailureâ is in the name, it doesn't mean that your heart stops beating. It means that it's weak. Shortness of breath and feeling tired can be signs of the condition. Often people also have swelling in their ankles, feet, legs, and mid-section because the heart is not strong enough to pump blood properly. In the early stages of heart failure, you may have trouble breathing after exercise, getting dressed, or walking across a room. But as the heart gets weaker, you may feel breathless even when you lie down. See your doctor if that's happening to you. She can recommend medicines and treatments that can help. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate -- usually more than 100 beats per minute in an adult. There are several kinds, but one that may cause shortness of breath is SVT, or atrial tachycardia. In SVT, the heart rate speeds up because the heart's electrical signals don't fire properly. People who have SVT and are short of breath should get medical help right away. Your doctor may recommend other things that can help, too, like quitting smoking and drinking less coffee and alcohol. Pulmonary edema . This condition means there's extra fluid in your lungs, which makes it hard to breathe. It's usually caused by heart problems. If the heart is ill or damaged, it cannot pump out enough of the blood it gets from the lungs. When that happens, pressure in the heart builds up and pushes fluid into the lungs' air sacs, where it doesn't belong. Breathing problems may happen over time, or they may come all of a sudden. Get medical help right away if you have trouble breathing that's worse when you lie down, if you have to gasp for breath, feel like you are drowning, have blue or gray skin color, cough up spit that may have blood in it, or feel your heartbeat is fast or irregular. Cardiomyopathy is a serious problem with the heart muscle that makes it hard for it to pump and send blood to the body. There are different types of cardiomyopathy and many reasons it happens, such as a heart attack, diabetes, or cancer treatment. Or the reason could be linked to excess weight, too much alcohol, or high blood pressure. In some cases, doctors don't know why it happens. You may not notice any symptoms of cardiomyopathy at first. But as it gets worse you may feel breathless when you're active or even at rest. You may get swollen legs, ankles, and feet. You could feel tired or dizzy, have a cough while lying down, a fast, fluttering heartbeat, or chest pain. If you have trouble breathing, or chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes, get emergency help. If you have a breathing problem, you need to see a doctor. He will examine you and may want check your blood or do other tests to find out what's going on. You might want to make notes about how you feel and bring them to your appointment. That way, you won't forget the important details. You may also want to write down some questions you'd like to ask the doctor. The more your doctor knows, the better."
341,"Exercise is good for you, and you can exercise safely, even with allergic asthma. A little planning is all it takes to help you breathe easier and stay in shape. When your asthma is controlled, you should be much more able to exercise without problems. Medications can help lessen asthma symptoms and prevent flares. Talk to your doctor about what types of exercise, and how often, are right for you. People with allergic asthma have the classic symptoms of wheezing and trouble breathing when they're around their triggers. Everyone is different, but the most common triggers are: Cats Mold Pollen Dust mites Cockroaches Your doctor can help you figure out what your triggers are. Then try to avoid them when you work out. If pollen makes your allergic asthma worse, keep close tabs on the pollen count in your area. Try exercising outdoors in the early evening, when pollen counts are lower, instead of early morning when pollen counts are higher. Check online for your local pollen count before you head out. When the pollen count is extra high, pass on your run or soccer game and exercise indoors that day instead. You should always carry a rescue inhaler, such as albuterol, with you. They work quickly to open up your airways. Use your rescue inhaler 10-15 minutes before exercising, even if you don't have symptoms. Although it won't help your asthma, taking an antihistamine 60-90 minutes before going outside can help ease itchy eyes and a runny nose from pollen. No matter what sort of exercise you prefer, warm up beforehand and ease into the activity. A few simple stretches and maybe a short walk before you run or pick up your tennis racket can set you up to make it through your exercise without breathing problems. Warm air doesn't constrict your airways the way cold and dry air can. For that reason, swimming is often a good activity for people with allergic asthma. At the pool, you're breathing in warm, humid air that won't shut down your lungs. Bringing in air through your nose will warm it up before it gets to your lungs. If you need to breathe through your mouth, purse your lips close together so they form an "" O."" That will help warm the air, too. Short bursts of exercise will make an asthma attack less likely. Try walking a quarter of a mile and then resting. Or pick a sport that alternates levels of intensity. For example, in baseball, you run hard for a few seconds, then stand, then run again. Conditioning your body for exercise is key. Start slowly, and build up your endurance and stamina over time. When you're done, cool down before you stop exercising completely. Slow your pace. Do some more stretches to help switch from exercise to rest."

They can happen because of allergies or other reasons. Your doctor may call them urticaria. Hives usually itch, but they may also burn or sting. They can show up anywhere on your body, including the face, lips, tongue, throat, and ears. They range in size from a pencil eraser to a dinner plate and may join together to form larger areas known as plaques. They can last for hours, weeks, or even years. Angioedema is different. The swelling happens under the skin, not on the surface. It's marked by deep swelling around the eyes and lips and sometimes of the genitals, hands, and feet. It generally lasts longer than hives, but the swelling usually goes away in less than 24 hours. It's rare, but angioedema of the throat, tongue, or lungs can block your airways, making it hard to breathe. Allergic reactions, chemicals in foods, insect stings, sunlight, and medicines can make your body release a chemical called histamine. Histamine sometimes makes blood plasma leak out of small blood vessels in the skin, causing hives or angioedema. Sometimes, doctors don't know exactly why hives have formed. Acute urticaria and/or angioedema are hives or swelling lasting less than 6 weeks. The most common causes are foods, medicines, latex, and infections. Insect bites or a disease may also be responsible. The most common foods that cause hives are nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, soy, wheat, and milk. Fresh foods cause hives more often than cooked foods. Certain food additives and preservatives may also be to blame. Drugs that can cause hives and angioedema include aspirin and other NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen), high blood pressure medications (such as ACE inhibitors), and painkillers such as codeine. Chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are hives or swelling that lasts more than 6 weeks. The cause is usually harder to find than in acute cases. The causes can be similar to those of acute urticaria but can also include your immune system, chronic infections, hormonal disorders, and tumors. Physical urticaria are hives caused by direct physical stimulation of the skin -- for example, cold, heat, sunlight, vibration, pressure, sweating, and exercise. They usually happen right where the skin was affected and rarely appear anywhere else. Most appear within 1 hour after exposure. Dermatographism are hives that form after firmly stroking or scratching the skin. You may also have other forms of hives. Hereditary angioedema is painful swelling under the skin. It runs in families. Your doctor will ask you many questions to try to find the cause of hives or angioedema. You'll also get a checkup. Your doctor may give you skin tests to find out if you're allergic to something. You may get blood tests, too. The best treatment is to identify and remove the trigger. But that's not always easy. Your doctor may prescribe antihistamines to ease your symptoms or help prevent them. If you have chronic hives, you may need antihistamines or a combination of medications, such as steroids or a biologic drug. For severe hives or angioedema, you may need an injection of epinephrine or a steroid medication. While you wait for the hives and swelling to disappear: Avoid hot water. Use lukewarm water instead. Use gentle, mild soap. Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the affected areas. Try to work and sleep in a cool room. Wear loose-fitting lightweight clothes. If you have hives or angioedema and any of the following symptoms, call your doctor right away: Dizziness Wheezing Trouble breathing Tightness in the chest Swelling of the tongue, lips, or face"
343,"The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- or ADHD -- vary from person to person, but consist of some combination of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention. People who are inattentive have a hard time keeping their mind focused on one thing and may get bored with a task after only a few minutes. Focusing conscious, deliberate attention to organizing and completing routine tasks may be difficult. Often they lose track of things or forget things easily. You may notice restlessness, procrastination, problems remembering obligations, trouble staying seated during meetings or activities, or starting multiple projects at the same time but rarely finishing them. Hyperactivity. People who are hyperactive always seem to be in motion. They can't sit still and may dash around or talk incessantly. Children with ADHD are unable to sit still and pay attention in class. They may roam around the room, squirm in their seats, wiggle their feet, touch everything or noisily tap a pencil. Older adolescents and adults with ADHD may feel intensely restless. Impulsivity. People who are overly impulsive seem unable to think before they act. As a result, they may blurt out answers to questions or inappropriate comments, or run into the street without looking. Their impulsivity may make it difficult for them to wait for things they want or to take their turn in games. They may grab a toy from another child or hit when they are upset. They often have difficulty making and keeping friends. ADHD often coexists with other conditions, such as learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. Some symptoms may overlap with other medical conditions, as well. You or your child shows symptoms of ADHD. Because the disorder can be difficult to assess, be sure to see a doctor who is experienced with diagnosing and treating ADHD and similar problems."
344,"The person is seriously injured in an animal attack. Apply sustained pressure for several minutes. Wash with clean water and gentle soap for 15 minutes. Notify the local health department or animal control about the animal's possible whereabouts. If the animal is a pet, get owner's contact information. Do not wait for symptoms to appear. If possible, bring information about the animal. If the person was in an enclosed area with a bat, see a health care provider whether or not there is a bite wound. The person may have been bitten and not know it. If there is any risk of rabies infection, the health care provider will recommend anti-rabies treatment. This may include a series of shots. The person may require a tetanus shot, depending on the date of the last shot."
345,"Chemotherapy can help fight cancer, but it also has side effects. Everyone reacts differently. The type of chemo drugs you use can affect your experience. Try these tips to help manage some common side effects. You can help ease nausea and vomiting by changing your eating patterns: Eat five or six small meals rather than three big ones. Take your time when you eat and drink. Drink an hour before or after meals rather than when you eat. Apple juice, tea, and flat ginger ale may help. Avoid strong-smelling foods. Strong smells can sometimes bring on nausea. Pass on sweets, and fried and fatty foods, which may make you queasy. Your doctor may prescribe anti-nausea drugs. These are usually given to prevent you from feeling nauseous. Talk to your doctor about the best anti-nausea drug for you. Sometimes you may need to try different drugs until you find one that helps you the most. Try acupuncture. Some people have found it helps relieve nausea and vomiting. Relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation may also help stop these side effects. Some types of chemotherapy can affect your sense of taste. Follow these tips to better enjoy eating: Red meat may taste different to you. If so, try poultry, mild-flavored fish, or dairy products instead. If your favorite foods taste different, avoid them so you don't develop a distaste for them. If foods taste metallic, try eating with plastic utensils. Use a sweet marinade to help bring flavor to your main dish. You may find yourself feeling tired, but there are ways to help manage that. Rest or take short naps during the day. Exercise. A short walk may boost your energy. Ask family or friends for help when you need it. Focus your energy on important things. If you just can't shake the feeling of being tired, check with your doctor. In some patients, chemotherapy can lead to anemia and low red blood cell counts. Your doctor can test your blood and treat you if necessary. Some people feel short-term mental fog after treatment. To manage so-called âchemo brain,â try these tips: Use a daily planner to help you manage -- and remember -- appointments, names, addresses, numbers, and to-do lists. Keep your brain active. You could take a class, attend lectures, or do word puzzles. Eat well, and get enough exercise and sleep. Focus on one thing at a time. Some, but not all chemo treatments, can lead to hair loss. If your treatment does, here's what you can do: After chemotherapy, use soft-bristle brushes. Avoid hair products with harsh chemicals, such as hair dyes or permanents. Cutting your hair short may make it look thicker and fuller. If you think you'd want a wig, shop for it before you lose your hair. That way, you can better match it to your hair. Wear a hat or scarf in cold weather, and use sunscreen to protect your scalp from the sun. Your scalp may feel tender and dry. Wash it with mild moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, and apply gentle lotions. You may be more sensitive to sunlight in the months following treatment. Stay out of direct sunlight, especially when the sun's rays are the strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.). Use sunscreen (look for a âbroad-spectrumâ product with a SPF of 30 or higher) and lip balm with sunscreen. Wear long pants, long sleeve shirts, and wide-brimmed hat when outdoors."
346,"The wonderful bond you create with your baby when you breastfeed is like no other. And experts agree that breast milk is ideal for your infant. But even though you want to give your baby the best start you can, you can't help but be concerned. What will nursing do to your breasts? Think of their size and shape, for example. Throughout your life -- and especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding -- the size and shape of your breasts can change. Breast size is determined by how much fatty tissue there is. Making milk creates denser tissue in your breasts. After breastfeeding, both the fatty tissue and connective tissue in your breasts may shift. Your breasts may or may not return to their pre-breastfeeding size or shape. Some women's breasts stay large, and others shrink. But sagging or staying full can be as much a result of genetics, weight gain during pregnancy, and age as a result of breastfeeding. When you're nursing, the flow of milk can stretch your breast skin and tissue. That leaves some women with an ""empty"" or ""stretched out"" look to their breasts when the milk-producing structures shrink to the size they were before you got pregnant. It's a common cosmetic breast problem after breastfeeding, but it isn't a medical concern. Women often fear that breastfeeding will make their breasts sag. But other factors can change your breast appearance more than breastfeeding. These include: BMI -- body mass index, a measure of your percentage of body fat The number of pregnancies you've had A large pre-pregnancy breast size Age A history of smoking Each breast is independent. So what happens to one breast during breastfeeding won't necessarily happen to the other. Breast engorgement, or painful overfilling of the breasts with milk is a common condition that may leave one breast slightly misshapen afterward, for instance. Any dimpling or puckering of your breast may be a sign of a breast lump underneath and should be checked by your doctor. Breast tissue extends up toward your armpit. So, as breast tissue swells with milk and then shrinks again after breastfeeding, the contours of your bust line may change. Many women have uneven breasts before becoming pregnant as well as after breastfeeding. It's possible for one breast to return to its pre-pregnancy size while the other stays larger, droops, or flattens more. Some women end up with one breast a full cup size smaller or larger than the other after breastfeeding and simply learn to love the body that nourished their babies -- no matter what its shape. Most breast problems after breastfeeding are cosmetic changes, not real medical concerns. But it's wise to stay up to date on your regular breast screening tests to ensure your breast health. Breast self-exams are a simple way to keep tabs on your breast health and changes. Examine your breasts once a month, even while breastfeeding. It's especially important to examine your breasts in the months after you stop breastfeeding, as the shape and size of your breasts change. Report any lumps or unusual nipple discharge to your doctor. Some lumps can even extend to the armpit. Most lumps are benign, meaning they are not cancer. But they still should be checked for breast cancer. A breast exam by your doctor can evaluate whether a breast problem after breastfeeding needs medical attention. Have your doctor perform a breast exam once a year or any time you notice unusual breast changes after breastfeeding. A mammogram(breast X-ray) can diagnose a lump too small for you to feel. If you have a breast problem after breastfeeding, your doctor may advise a mammogram right away, rather than waiting for your regularly scheduled yearly or biannual mammogram. It's also safe to have a mammogram while breastfeeding if you need one. It won't affect your milk or your baby's health. Call your doctor if you have any of these breast problems: A lump in your breast A red, sore lump that may feel hot to the touch, which could be a plugged milk duct Dimpling or puckering of your breast Fever or flu symptoms, which could indicate a breast infection (called mastitis) Nipple retraction (the nipple turned inward) Painful breasts (more than the discomfort related to breastfeeding) Rash on your breast Unusual nipple discharge or a bleeding nipple A positive note: Breastfeeding lowers your risk of breast cancer. Women who have never breastfed have a slightly higher risk. When breast size or shape changes a lot after breastfeeding, some women consider cosmetic surgery. A breast lift, called a mastopexy, can be performed to help sagging and to reposition the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple) higher on the breast. A thorough evaluation by a qualified cosmetic surgeon, including a complete breast health history, is advised before you consider surgery."

Saliva is an important part of a healthy body. It is mostly made of water. But saliva also contains important substances that your body needs to digest food and keep your teeth strong. Saliva is important because it: Keeps your mouth moist and comfortable Helps you chew, taste, and swallow Fights germs in your mouth and prevents bad breath Has proteins and minerals that protect tooth enamel and prevent tooth decay and gum disease Helps keep dentures securely in place You make saliva when you chew. The harder you chew, the more saliva you make. Sucking on a hard candy or cough drop helps you make saliva, too. The glands that make saliva are called salivary glands. The salivary glands sit inside each cheek, at the bottom of your mouth, and near your front teeth by the jaw bone. There are six major salivary glands and hundreds of minor ones. Saliva moves through tubes called salivary ducts. Normally, the body makes up to 2 to 4 pints of saliva a day. Usually, the body makes the most saliva in the late afternoon. It makes the least amount at night. But everyone is different. What doctors consider to be a normal amount of saliva varies quite a bit. That makes diagnosing saliva problems a bit of a challenge. Certain diseases and medicines can affect how much saliva you make. If you do not make enough saliva, your mouth can become quite dry. This condition is called dry mouth (xerostomia). Dry mouth causes the gums, tongue, and other tissues in the mouth to become swollen and uncomfortable. Germs thrive in this type of setting. A germy, dry mouth leads to bad breath. Dry mouth also makes you more likely to develop rapid tooth decay and gum (periodontal) disease. That's because saliva helps clear food particles from your teeth. This helps reduce your risk for cavities. If you have dry mouth, you may also notice you do not taste things like you used to. Dry mouth is common in older adults, although the reasons are unclear. Diseases that affect the whole body (systemic disorders), poor nutrition, and the use of certain drugs are thought to play a key role. Too little saliva and dry mouth can be caused by: Certain diseases such as HIV/ AIDS, Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes, and Parkinson's Blockage in one or more tubes that drain saliva (salivary duct obstruction) Chemotherapy and radiation therapy Dehydration "" Fight or flight"" stress response Structural problem with a salivary duct Smoking cigarettes Hundreds of commonly used medicines are known to affect saliva flow and cause dry mouth, such as: Antihistamines Anxiety medicines Appetite suppressants Certain types of blood pressure drugs Diuretics (water pills) Most antidepressants Certain pain medicines (analgesics) Always ask your health-care provider about side effects you might have when taking a medication. Try these tips to help keep your salivary glands healthy and your mouth moist and comfortable: Drink plenty of water Chew sugar-free gum Suck on sugar-free candy If dry mouth persists, your doctor or dentist may recommend rinsing your mouth with artificial saliva. Artificial saliva is a liquid or spray sold without a prescription. It can be used as often as needed. Artificial saliva helps keep your mouth moist and comfortable. But it doesn't contain the proteins, minerals, and other substances found in real saliva that help with digestion. Too much saliva is usually not something to worry about unless it persists. It's normal to make more or less saliva depending on what you eat or drink. Your body usually takes care of excess saliva by swallowing more. You can make too much saliva if: One or more salivary gland is overactive You have problems swallowing It is normal for your salivary glands to go into overdrive when you eat very spicy foods. Taste buds on your tongue play a big role in how much saliva you make. Pop something spicy or very sour in your mouth and your taste buds react by telling your body to make more saliva. Acidic foods tend to trigger a lot more saliva than sweet foods. If excess saliva bothers you, try changing your diet. If you have a lot of saliva all the time, tell your health-care provider. It could be the side effect of a medication or the result of a medical condition or disease. If you have problems swallowing, you may feel like you have a lot of saliva in your mouth and may drool. Chronic drooling is most often seen in people who have poor muscle control in the face and mouth. Diseases and health conditions that can cause too much saliva include: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS), also called Lou Gehrig's disease Bell's palsy Cerebral palsy Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) Enlarged tongue (macroglossia) Intellectual disability Parkinson's disease Poisoning Pregnancy (usually seen in those with extreme nausea and vomiting) Rabies Stroke Medications that can cause too much saliva include: Some seizure medicines such as Klonopin (clonazepam) Schizophrenia medicine called clozapine ( Clozaril, Fazaclo ODT) Salagen (pilocarpine), used to treat dry mouth in people who have radiation therapy There are many medical names for excess saliva. What your doctor calls it depends on what is causing the excess saliva. Hypersalivation and sialorrhea are general terms for increased saliva. Treatment for excessive saliva depends on what is causing the problem. It may include: Prescription medicine Botox shots Surgery Your doctor will probably first recommend a prescription medicine to help reduce the amount of saliva you make. Such medicines include glycopyrrolate and scopolamine. Common side effects include problems urinating, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, blurred vision, and sleepiness. If you have severe drooling, your doctor may suggest Botox injections into one or more salivary glands. This treatment is considered safe, but results only last a few months. You will need to have more Botox shots in the future. Surgery to remove a salivary gland or re-route a salivary duct may be done in severe cases. This type of surgery usually provides a permanent cure for excess saliva."
348,"Within the scrotum, the testicles are secured by a structure called the spermatic cord, which contains an anchoring tissue called the gubernaculum at the lower part of the testicle. Sometimes, this cord gets twisted around a testicle, cutting off the blood supply. Symptoms of testicular torsion include sudden and severe pain, enlargement of the affected testicle, tenderness, and swelling. This condition, which occurs most often in males who are under age 25, is usually due to the congenital absence of the gubernaculum, which would otherwise keep the testicle from twisting on the spermatic cord. Torsion may also occur following an injury to the testicles, strenuous activity, or simply rolling over in bed. Testicular torsion requires immediate medical attention. Treatment usually involves correction of the problem through surgery or manual detorsion. Testicular function may be saved if the condition is diagnosed and corrected immediately. If the blood supply to the testicle is cut off for a long period of time, the testicle can become permanently damaged and may need to be removed."
349,"Do you get a tightness or heaviness in your chest sometimes? There are a bunch of reasons you might feel this way. You may have a cold, or it could be something more serious. Talk to your doctor to find out what's going on. He'll want to know if you have other symptoms that can help pinpoint your condition. You don't want to fool around if your symptoms could mean a heart attack. Chest pain is one of them. Get medical help right away if you also have any of these: Pressure or squeezing in the center of your chest Pain in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach Feeling short of breath Sweating, nausea, light-headedness It's a serious condition that starts when your heart doesn't pump as strongly as it should. When that happens, blood and fluid can back up in your lungs. You might get: Short of breath, especially when lying down Tired and weak Coughing spells, especially at night Swollen legs and ankles Weight gain Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these signs. It's a lung infection that you get from a bacteria, virus, or fungus. Sometimes it starts out as the flu. You may feel short of breath or get other symptoms like: Coughing up yellow-green or bloody phlegm Fever Chills Localized chest pain when you breathe in See your doctor if any of those happen to you or you think you might have pneumonia. You're probably all too familiar with the sneezing, coughing, and stuffy nose that go along with a cold. But it can make your lungs congested, too. Your airways get inflamed and make extra mucus. You might start coughing some of it up. Get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids, which helps thin the mucus in your lungs. It's sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis, and it can make you short of breath. Smoking causes this disease most of the time. When you have COPD, the airways in your lungs get inflamed and thicken, which means less oxygen comes in and less carbon dioxide goes out. Over time, the shortness of breath gets worse. Your doctor can give you medication to help you manage the symptoms. If the problems get worse, you may need to use an oxygen tank to help with your breathing trouble. Most of the time it's caused by smoking. Your symptoms may include: Chest pain Shortness of breath Hoarseness Coughing up blood Lung infections like bronchitis and pneumonia If you have it, your swollen airways are sensitive to things you're exposed to every day, like allergy triggers such as pollen, air pollutants, or chemicals in your workplace. The disease tends to run in families. With asthma, you may notice a wheezing sound when you breathe. Sometimes you only have it after you exercise or when you have a cold. Your chest may also feel tight. And you might have a cough at night or get short of breath. A lot of medicines can help, including inhalers that you breathe in to give you quick relief. Anything you're allergic to can make it harder to breathe, and result in a congested chest, watery eyes, and wheezing. Pollen, dust, and pet dander (tiny flecks of skin shed by animals) are some common culprits. There are lots of ways to get relief. Drugs like antihistamines and decongestants may help. So may regular allergy shots."
350,"Skin changes are common when you have lupus, but you don't have to let them get the best of you. Medical treatment can get rid of some. You can also protect your skin and use cover-up tricks to make them less visible. Ultraviolet ( UV) rays in daylight can trigger problems in your skin, such as a butterfly-shaped rash across the nose and cheeks. UV rays can also trigger patches of raised sores and even worsen the disease overall. Both types of UV rays -- UVA and UVB -- are the culprits for these rashes. Try these prevention tips: Use sunscreen every day. Do this even if you're only taking a short walk. Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 . To make sure you're protected against both types of UV rays, check the label to see that it contains mexoryl or avobenzone (chemical blockers), or zinc oxide or titanium dioxide (physical blockers). Reapply sunscreen every 80 minutes, or more often if you are sweating or swimming. Women can put sunscreen on before makeup and reapply with tinted zinc oxide powder. Avoid peak sun hours. Try to stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when sunlight is the strongest. Exercise outdoors in the early morning or late afternoon or evening. Cover up. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you're outside. Also use UV-filtering, polarized sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat. Take more precautions if you're taking medicine. Some drugs can make you more sensitive to the sun, such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, or blood pressure medication. So be extra careful about avoiding sunlight. If you have a butterfly-shaped rash on your face or other rashes, ask your doctor if corticosteroid creams, ointments, gels, or injections can help. Uneven skin color, blotches, and scars can be caused by lupus. If you have them, makeup can be a good cover-up. Try green hues to offset redness. Bleaching creams with hydroquinone can help dark spots. If you have scars that are lumpy or pitted, your dermatologist can inject filler. You can also consider laser therapy for red or dark spots. But these are only an option if your lupus is not active, so get your doctor's OK first. Lupus can also affect the skin on the inside of your mouth and nose. If you have sores in your mouth, gargle many times a day with hydrogen peroxide or buttermilk mixed with a little water. Ask your doctor about special mouthwash or dental paste that can help healing. For sores in your nose, try soothing them with petroleum jelly. You may find that your fingertips turn red, white, or blue in the cold. This is known as Raynaud's phenomenon. To help with this problem, wear gloves and socks in cold weather or air-conditioned rooms. Buy over-the-counter hand warmers to keep in your pockets for warming your hands. Also avoid caffeine and cigarettes, which can make this problem worse. You may have some hair loss and fragile hair if you have lupus. Try these tips to keep your hair healthy and look your best: For fragile hair: Avoid pulling your hair. Don't put stress on your hair by using curlers, chemical treatments like coloring or straightening, and hot combs or curling irons. Wash with baby shampoo and a leave-in conditioner with sunblock. For minor thinning or bald patches: Treat yourself to a new hairstyle. Ask your stylist to suggest a short, layered cut that can help hide the areas and make your hair look thicker. Hair extensions are an option for thin spots on the side of your head if you aren't actively losing hair. But protect your scalp: Avoid chemicals, glues, and heat, and don't make them tight, or you could pull out weak hair. For more extensive hair loss: Consider a wig or try scarves or wraps. Hair transplants may be an option. See your doctor right away for rashes on the scalp. Early treatment can help you avoid scarring and hair loss. Consider joining a support group if you find that changes in the way you look are affecting your self-esteem. Talking to a therapist may also help."
351,"Do you have a hunch that you don't see colors as clearly you should? Ever been told that something has different shades, but they all look the same to you? If so, you could be color blind. Some people are color blind and don't know it. For example, they know tree leaves are green, so they think the color they see is âgreen.â This vision issue usually doesn't make you see things in shades of gray. That's rare. Most people who are color blind have trouble telling some colors apart. They may not be able to tell the difference between red and green or blue and yellow. Eye professionals have lots of ways to check for the condition. The most common tests use colored tablets or diagrams. If you notice a serious change in how you see color, call an ophthalmologist. That's a doctor who's trained in eye care and vision. Your symptoms could be a warning sign of something more serious, so it's a good idea to get them checked out. You should also tell your regular doctor if you think you're having trouble seeing colors. In some schools, nurses test children for color problems. Color blindness runs in families. If you have relatives with the condition, it's important to get tested. Ishihara color test. This checks for red-green color blindness. The doctor will ask you to look at a series of circles (also called plates) with dots of different colors and sizes. Some of the dots form shapes or one- or two-digit numbers. If you have trouble seeing red and green, those shapes will be hard to see, or you may not see them at all. Cambridge color test. This is a lot like the Ishihara test, except that you look at a computer screen. You'll try to find a â Câ shape that's a different color than the background. It pops up randomly. When you see it, you press one of four keys. Anomaloscope. You look through an eyepiece and see a circle. The top half of the circle is a yellow light. The bottom half is made up of red and green lights. You turn knobs until both halves are the same color and brightness. Doctors use this test to check for trouble seeing red and green. Farnsworth- Munsell 100 hue test. This uses blocks or pegs that are different shades of the same color. Your task is to line them up a certain way. This test checks to see if you can pick up slight color changes. Companies that need workers to see colors correctly sometimes use it. Farnsworth lantern test. The U. S. military uses this to see if recruits have a mild or severe form of color blindness. You can serve in the armed forces if your condition is mild. Being color blind can make some things tricky, but it's not serious. You can still drive, work, and live a normal life. You may need to find other ways to do some things, though. Some people with red-and-green color blindness wear special contact lenses. Others download apps to help them with colors."
352,"The aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) test is a blood test that checks for liver damage. Your doctor might order this test to find out if you have liver disease and to monitor your treatment. Your liver is an organ that has many important jobs. It makes a fluid called bile that helps your body digest food. It also removes waste products and other toxins from your blood. It produces proteins, as well as substances that help your blood clot. Alcohol or drug use and diseases such as hepatitis can damage your liver and keep it from doing these jobs. AST is an enzyme your liver makes. Other organs, like your heart, kidneys, brain, and muscles, also make smaller amounts. AST is also called SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase). Normally, AST levels in your blood are low. When your liver is damaged, it puts more AST into your blood, and your levels rise. A high AST level is a sign of liver damage, but it can also mean you have damage to another organ that makes it, like your heart or kidneys. That's why doctors often do the AST test together with tests of other liver enzymes. Your doctor can order an AST test if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as: Yellow skin or eyes, called jaundice Tiredness Weakness Swollen belly Stomach pain Appetite loss Itchy skin Dark-colored urine Light-colored poop Swelling in your legs and ankles Bruises Other reasons to have this test: You've been exposed to the hepatitis virus. You drink a lot of alcohol. You take medicine that's known to damage the liver. You have a family history of liver disease. You have obesity. You have diabetes or metabolic syndrome. You've had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Your doctor might also want you to get this test to see if treatments you take for liver disease are working. The AST test is also part of a comprehensive metabolic panel -- a blood test your doctor does as part of a routine exam. You don't need any special preparation for the ALT test. Tell your doctor what drugs or supplements you take. Some medicines can affect the results of this test. A nurse or lab tech will take a sample of your blood -- usually from a vein in your arm. She will first tie a band around the upper part of your arm to make your vein fill with blood and swell up. Then she will clean an area on your arm with an antiseptic and put a needle in one of your veins. Your blood will go into a vial or tube. The blood test should only take a couple of minutes. After your blood is drawn, the lab tech will take off the band and pull out the needle. She'll put a piece of gauze and a bandage where the needle went in to stop the bleeding. The AST blood test is safe. Risks are usually minor, and can include: Bleeding Bruising Infection Pain when the needle is inserted Fainting or feeling dizzy You should have the results in about a day. They are given in units per liter (units/ L). Normal ranges are: Males: 10 to 40 units/ L Females: 9 to 32 units/ L Your exact range may depend on which lab your doctor uses. Talk with her about the specifics of your case. Higher-than-normal AST levels can be caused by: Chronic (ongoing) hepatitis Cirrhosis (long-term damage and scarring of the liver) Blockage in the bile ducts that carry digestive fluid from the liver to the gallbladder and intestine Liver cancer Very high AST levels can be caused by: Acute viral hepatitis Damage to the liver from drugs or other toxic substances A blockage in blood flow to the liver Your doctor might also compare your AST and ALT levels. If you have liver disease, usually your ALT level will be higher than your AST level. These other conditions not tied to your liver can also raise your AST level: Burns Heart attack Intense exercise Muscle injury Pregnancy Pancreatitis Seizures Surgery Some diseases or medicines you take can cause a âfalse positiveâ result on the AST test. This means your test is positive, even though you don't have liver damage. Any of these can cause a false positive result: Diabetic ketoacidosis ( Your body can't make enough insulin, which helps sugar enter your cells.) Some antibiotics, such as erythromycin estolate or para-aminosalicylic acid ( Paser) AST is usually done as part of a group of liver function tests called a liver panel. It's often ordered with a test for alanine aminotransferase ( ALT), another liver enzyme. ALT is more accurate than AST at detecting liver disease. It can more accurately show whether the problem is in your liver or in another part of your body, like your heart or muscles. Your doctor can compare the amount of ALT to AST in your blood to find out whether you have liver damage or a problem with another organ, such as your heart. Your doctor might also do other tests of enzymes and proteins your liver makes, such as: Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) Bilirubin Total protein Talk with your doctor to make sure you understand all of your liver test results. Also find out how these results might affect your treatment."
353,"The most common -- and often, the first -- symptom is blood in your urine. It may be just a little, or it can be enough to change the color of your pee. It may turn orange, pink, or darker red. You may see blood one day, but not the next. If you have bladder cancer, the blood eventually comes back. In some cases, you can't see blood in your urine. Your doctor or lab tech will only detect it with a urine test. Make an appointment if you have any of these other symptoms: You have to pee more often than usual. Your urine changes color. It hurts or burns when you pee. You feel like you have to pee -- even if your bladder's not full. You can't pee, or you pee very little. If you notice any of these things, call your doctor, but don't panic. Having these symptoms doesn't mean you have cancer. You could have a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, or some other less serious condition. Once bladder cancer starts to spread, you may notice that: You can't pee, even when you feel like you have to. Your lower back hurts. You're losing weight without trying. You're not as hungry as usual. You have swollen feet. Your bones hurt. You often feel extremely tired or weak. Again, see your doctor if any of these things happen to you. They more likely signal that you have something other than bladder cancer."
354,"Our bodies usually change quietly, almost without notice. Children grow taller. Our hair often thins as we age. It's all part of maturing, and it's controlled by hormones. But sometimes things go wrong. The hormone that helps control growth and the chemical reactions in our bodies is called human growth hormone. ( You may see it written as HGH, or GH for short.) Your body might make it in great amounts or not at all. Too much or too little HGH can lead to a variety of issues, including: Dwarfism Fatigue Acromegaly (too much growth of hands, feet, facial bones, and other body parts) Bone weakness Delayed puberty If you or your child has any of these conditions, your doctor may suggest you take a growth hormone stimulation test. The basis of this test is a simple blood sample, which is then looked at in a lab. Though growth hormone issues can cause problems if left untreated, treating them may be as simple as a regular injection of growth hormone. And in children, these issues may get better on their own over time. Growth hormone is made by the pituitary gland. It's a pea-sized gland near the center of your head, just below the front of the brain and behind your nose. GH isn't the only hormone made by the pituitary gland. In fact, the pituitary has been called the âmaster glandâ because its hormones help control other hormones. It's part of what's called the endocrine system, which oversees many body functions. But if too much or too little GH is in your body, there may be something wrong with your pituitary gland. In children, you may find this out during a visit with your pediatrician. During a typical visit, your pediatrician will likely check your child for height, weight, and head size and see how he compares with the normal range for children of that age. If the measurements are outside that range, she may order tests. If you're an adult, you may want to visit your doctor if your symptoms include: Low energy Less strength Depression Decline in muscle mass Increase in body fat There are many different possible causes for these symptoms, but they may also signal issues with GH production. A test can measure the amount of GH in your blood. Your pituitary gland releases GH in pulses that vary by sex, age, and even time of day. That is why doctors use different methods to stimulate or suppress the release of growth hormone before you take the test. Several tests may be needed to see if your child has a growth hormone deficiency. Some involve the measurement of different hormones with simple blood tests. The growth hormone stimulation uses one or two different medications to âstimulateâ or raise the amount of GH released by his body. Then your doctor can see how much his body is making. There are a number of things that may be required and helpful before your child takes the test: Fast: Your child shouldn't have any food after midnight the day of the test. Avoid medications: He shouldn't take certain medications the night before and the day of the test unless your doctor or nurse has permitted them. One of the medicines that may be used, such as clonidineâââââââ, doesn't mix with medications such as amphetamine and dextroamphetamine ( Adderall) or methylphenidate ( Ritalin), so your doctor will give you instructions on whether you need to make any changes with them before the test. Be ready to pass the time: Since the test takes a few hours, bring books, videos, or other distractions to keep your child from getting bored. Be sure he wears comfortable clothes. Your doctor will typically ask you to take more than one kind of test. You may need the stimulation test, as well as some of these other tests: The GH suppression test, which lowers the amount of GH The IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 tests, which check the amount of a different but related hormones Tests to check for issues with other hormones, including cortisol, prolactin, and testosterone Children will also typically get a combination of these tests. If you need to take a growth hormone stimulation test, you may need to: Fast: Some medical experts recommend up to 12 hours without food before the test. Talk to your doctor about this beforehand to find out what you should do in your case. Avoid certain medications: These include insulin, birth control pills, and the herb St. John's wort. If you take these or any other medicines, talk to your doctor to see what you need to do. Don't exercise: Workouts 10 hours or less before the test can throw off resting hormone levels. Testing takes up to 3 hours, so you should also dress comfortably and bring a book or some entertainment. Low blood sugar and obesity may skew results, so talk with your doctor if you have these conditions. For your child, the test begins with a technician placing an IV line in his arm or hand. After giving a blood sample, your child will get a dose of medicine or medicines to stimulate the pituitary gland to release growth hormone. The most common medicines chosen are clonidine ( Catapres), arginine or glucagon. Insulin is less commonly used now because of safety concerns with children. During all of this, the assistant will probably take a blood sample around every 30 minutes. The samples are not large -- perhaps a couple of teaspoons, total, over the course of the day. At the end of the test, your child can eat. He should rest afterwards. It's a similar process for adults who get the GH stimulation test. Adults have the option of a medicine called macimorelin ( Macrilen)which is given as a liquid to drink. Insulin is less often used now because of unpleasant side effects and safety concerns due to low blood sugars. Both children and adult blood samples can also be checked for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 alongside the stimulation test. If you take the GH suppression test, you'll drink a glucose solution in the first 5 minutes, and get your blood checked every 30 minutes for 2 hours. Growth hormone tests aren't likely to cause any complications, though some people may feel faint. Bruising is possible where the IV line went into your vein. Test results should be ready in several days. High levels of GH may suggest: Possible acromegaly Gigantism (in children, it can cause really long bones, delayed puberty, and other problems) A tumor Low levels may indicate: Possible dwarfism Slow growth Hypopituitarism, which means your pituitary gland isn't working as well as it should. Because GH issues may be related to other glands, such as the thyroid, your doctor may recommend that you get more tests. If your doctor suspects a tumor, she may ask you to get an MRI, CT scan, or X-ray."
355,"You have lots of options to manage diabetes. Food, exercise, and medication work together to bring your blood sugar under control. Your doctor will help you figure out if you need to take medicine, which kind is right for you, and how often you should take it. Over your lifetime, you'll probably handle your disease in different ways. Sometimes medications stop working, and you'll have to switch. You'll need to adjust to changes in your body as you age. And researchers are looking for new diabetes medicines and ways to treat it. M edications are often the first kind of medicine people with type 2 diabetes try when diet and exercise alone aren't enough to keep their blood sugar in a healthy range. There are many of them, and they work in different ways. Biguanides. This group includes metformin, one of the most commonly used drugs to treat diabetes. It tells your liver to hang on to some of the glucose it makes. Meglitinides and sulfonylureas. These medications tell your pancreas to make more insulin. DPP-4 inhibitors keep your body from breaking down hormones that give your pancreas the ""go"" signal for insulin. This means they work longer when you need to lower your blood sugar after a meal. Thiazolidinediones, TZDs, or glitazones. These medicines help insulin work better. They lower insulin resistance from your cells so your pancreas doesn't have to work as hard. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors slow the digestion of food with complex carbohydrates like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and corn. This keeps your blood sugar from shooting up after you eat. SGLT2 inhibitors work by letting your kidneys pee out extra sugar. Bile acid sequestrants lower your cholesterol and can also help lower your blood glucose. You can take these medications by themselves or in combination with others, including insulin. Some pills have more than one kind of drug. Dopamine receptor agonists work directly on the brain to help it process dopamine. This, in turn, can increase your sensitivity to insulin so your body doesn't need as much of it. Those taking dopamine receptor agonists should also implement some lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and exercise for the medication to be more effective. Injectable drugs slow how quickly food leaves your stomach and make you feel full. And they tell your liver to back off making glucose around mealtimes. GLP-1 receptor agonists help your pancreas make insulin. Some of them you take every day, while others last a week. Pramlintide ( Symlin) acts like a hormone, amylin, that your pancreas sends out with insulin. You only take it if you're also using insulin. Insulin therapy could be a short-term fix for a stressful situation or because other medicines aren't enough to control their blood sugar. Types of insulin are grouped by how fast they start to work and how long their effects last. You might have to use more than one kind of insulin. Some insulins come pre-mixed. You can take insulin in one of several ways: Injections with a needle and syringe. You fill the syringes from a bottle of insulin and give yourself a shot. You pick a spot and rotate between belly, thigh, butt, and upper arm. Insulin pump . It connects to a tiny needle under your skin to provide a steady stream of insulin throughout the day. Insulin pen. It looks like a pen but has a needle on the end. Some are prefilled with insulin, while others have a container you replace. Inhaler. You breathe in powdered insulin. Injection port. This tube goes under your skin and lets you use a needle and syringe or pen without having to stick yourself in a different spot every time. You keep the port in place for a week and then replace it with a new one in a new spot. Jet injector. This sends a fine spray of insulin into your skin at high pressure instead of using a needle. Weight loss surgery gets rid of extra pounds. And that alone will help control your blood sugar. But it also raises the level of hormones in your gut called incretins. These tell your pancreas to make insulin. Over time, you may be able to take less medication. It isn't for everyone, though. Doctors usually recommend weight loss surgery only for men who are at least 100 pounds overweight and women with at least 80 extra pounds. You'll need to make lifestyle changes to help you successfully manage type 2 diabetes. Weight loss. Losing 5% to 10% of your body weight -- that's less than 20 pounds if you weigh 180 -- can lower your A1c levels and your risk for cardiovascular disease. It may help you cut back on medications to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Weight loss can also ease symptoms of depression and help with sleep apnea. Healthy diet. There's no one-size-fits-all diabetes diet. You'll need to pay attention to carbs, fiber, fat, and salt to manage your blood sugar and avoid complications of diabetes. How much and when you eat are important, too. Talk to your diabetes team or a registered dietitian to help you plan your meals and snacks. Physical activity. From working out to doing chores, activity lowers your blood sugar. It helps your cells use insulin. It also helps your muscles use glucose. Make sure you check your blood sugar before and after exercise. Better sleep. Not getting enough sleep can raise your odds of getting type 2 diabetes in the first place. The length of time you sleep and the quality of sleep can raise A1c levels, a test doctors use to check your average blood sugar levels over 3 months. That means improving your sleep can lead to lower blood sugar readings. Your doctor will want to see you often to do certain tests to see how well your diabetes is under control. These include: Blood glucose monitoring. You'll use a blood glucose meter to check your blood sugar when your doctor tells you to or get a gadget that continuously monitors your levels. Regular checkups. The doctor will check your A1c and cholesterol levels, along with doing tests to make sure your thyroid, liver, and kidneys are all working like they should. Regular eye exams. The doctor will check for signs of retinopathy, nerve damage to your eye caused by diabetes. Regular foot exams. The doctor will check for foot problems and nerve damage to your feet. Your blood glucose number tells you how well your treatment is working. Your doctor will let you know how many times a day you need to check it. It depends on what diabetes medications you're taking."
356,"A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection in any part of your urinary system, which includes your kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. If you're a woman, your chance of getting a urinary tract infection is high. Some experts rank your lifetime risk of getting one as high as 1 in 2, with many women having repeat infections, sometimes for years. About 1 in 10 men will get a UTI in their lifetime. Here's how to handle UTIs and how to make it less likely you'll get one in the first place. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The symptoms of a UTI can include: A burning feeling when you pee A frequent or intense urge to pee, even though little comes out when you do Cloudy, dark, bloody, or strange-smelling pee Feeling tired or shaky Fever or chills (a sign that the infection may have reached your kidneys) Pain or pressure in your back or lower abdomen An infection can happen in different parts of your urinary tract. Each type has a different name, based on where it is. Cystitis (bladder): You might feel like you need to pee a lot, or it might hurt when you pee. You might also have lower belly pain and cloudy or bloody urine. Pyelonephritis (kidneys): This can cause fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and pain in your upper back or side. Urethritis (urethra): This can cause a discharge and burning when you pee. UTIs are a key reason why doctors tell women to wipe from front to back after using the bathroom. The urethra -- the tube that takes pee from the bladder to the outside of the body -- is close to the anus. Bacteria from the large intestine, such as E. coli, can sometimes get out of your anus and into your urethra. From there, they can travel up to your bladder and, if the infection isn't treated, can continue on to infect your kidneys. Women have shorter urethras than men. That makes it easier for bacteria to get to their bladders. Having sex can introduce bacteria into your urinary tract, too. Some women are more likely to get UTIs because of their genes. The shape of their urinary tracts makes others more likely to be infected. Women with diabetes may be at higher risk because their weakened immune systems make them less able to fight off infections. Other conditions that can boost your risk include hormone changes, multiple sclerosis, and anything that affects urine flow, such as kidney stones, a stroke, and a spinal cord injury. If you suspect that you have a urinary tract infection, go to the doctor. You'll give a urine sample to test for UTI-causing bacteria. If you get frequent UTIs and your doctor suspects a problem in your urinary tract, they might take a closer look with an ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI scan. They might also use a long, flexible tube called a cystoscope to look inside your urethra and bladder. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for urinary tract infections. As always, be sure to take all of your prescribed medicine, even after you start to feel better. Drink lots of water to help flush the bacteria from your body. Your doctor may also give you a medication to soothe pain. You might find a heating pad helpful. Cranberry juice is often promoted to prevent or treat UTIs. The red berry contains a tannin that might prevent E. coli bacteria -- the most common cause of urinary tract infections -- from sticking to the walls of your bladder, where they can cause an infection. But research hasn't found that it does much to reduce infections. Experts are also looking at new ways to treat and prevent UTIs, including vaccines and things that boost your immune system. If a man gets a UTI, he's likely to get another. About 1 in 5 women have a second urinary tract infection, and some have them again and again. In most cases, each infection is brought on by a different type or strain of bacteria. But some bacteria can invade your body's cells and multiply, creating a colony of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They then travel out of the cells and re-invade your urinary tract. If you have three or more UTIs a year, ask your doctor to recommend a treatment plan. Some options include taking: A low dose of an antibiotic over a longer period to help prevent repeat infections A single dose of an antibiotic after sex, which is a common infection trigger Antibiotics for 1 or 2 days every time symptoms appear At-home urine tests, which you can get without a prescription, can help you decide whether you need to call your doctor. If you're taking antibiotics for a UTI, you can test to see whether they've cured the infection (although you still need to finish your prescription). Contact your doctor if the test is positive or if your symptoms continue, despite a negative test result. Following some tips can help you avoid getting another UTI: Empty your bladder often as soon as you feel the need to pee; don't rush, and be sure you've emptied your bladder completely. Wipe from front to back after you use the toilet. Drink lots of water. Choose showers over baths. Stay away from feminine hygiene sprays, scented douches, and scented bath products; they'll only increase irritation. Cleanse your genital area before sex. Pee after sex to flush out any bacteria that may have entered your urethra. If you use a diaphragm, unlubricated condoms, or spermicidal jelly for birth control, you may want to switch to another method. Diaphragms can increase bacteria growth, while unlubricated condoms and spermicides can irritate your urinary tract. All can make UTI symptoms more likely. Keep your genital area dry by wearing cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes. Don't wear tight jeans and nylon underwear; they can trap moisture, creating the perfect environment for bacteria growth."
357,"Penile cancer starts on the skin cells of the penis and can work its way inside. It's rare. But it can be treated, especially if it's found early on. In the U. S., doctors find it in about 2,100 men each year. If you or someone you love has it, you'll want to know what your options are. Experts don't know exactly what causes this disease. Not being circumcised may make it more likely. If bodily fluids get trapped in the foreskin and aren't washed away, they may contribute to the growth of cancer cells. Some research suggests that men who are exposed to certain strains of HPV (human papillomavirus) may also be more likely to get penile cancer. This type of cancer is more common in men over age 60, in smokers, and in those who have a weakened immune system. Changes in the penis skin are the most common symptom of penile cancer. They can show up on the foreskin of uncircumcised men, or on the penis tip (the glans) or shaft. Warning signs of the disease can include: Changes in thickness or color of skin on the penis A lump on it A rash or small âcrustyâ bumps on it; it can look like an unhealed scab. Growths on the penis that look bluish-brown Smelly discharge underneath the foreskin A sore on the penis, which may be bleeding Swelling at the end of the penis Lumps under the skin in the groin area Most men with these symptoms don't have penile cancer. Instead, it's an infection or an allergic reaction. Even so, it's important to get any unusual symptoms on or near your penis checked out right away. Early treatment is best. Your doctor will give you a physical exam, talk with you about your symptoms, and may recommend other tests, such as: A biopsy. The doctor will take a small sample of tissue from a skin lesion on the penis. Lab tests will check it for cancer cells. Imaging tests, like X-rays, CT scans, ultrasounds, and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). These look inside your body for tumors or other signs that cancer has spread. If your cancer is in the early stages, your treatment may include: A medicine that goes on your skin as a cream Cryotherapy, a procedure that uses an extremely cold liquid or a device to freeze and destroy tissue that contains cancer Mohs surgery, in which doctors remove affected skin, one layer at a time, until they reach normal, healthy tissue Lasers to cut and destroy areas that contain cancer Circumcision, which is surgery to remove the foreskin. You would have this procedure if you only had cancer in your foreskin. If your cancer is advanced or has a high risk of spreading, treatment may involve any of the above, and/or: Surgery to remove some or all o your inguinal lymph nodes if your cancer has spread to them Radiation and/or chemotherapy to rid your body of cancer cells A penectomy, which is surgery to remove some or all of your penis Most treatments for early-stage penile cancer don't affect your ability to have sex, but chemotherapy and radiation may. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects. Scientists are looking for new ways to treat early and advanced penile cancer in these studies, which test new drugs to see if they're safe and if they work. Clinical trials often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these studies might be a good fit for you. Before you sign up, ask for information on what's involved, and what the risks and benefits would be. You can learn more about different trials throughout the U. S. at the National Cancer Institute's web site, http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials. Ask your doctor about support groups at your hospital or in your community. You can also find support groups for men with penile cancer online. As you go through your treatment, it can also help to talk with a therapist or social worker who works with people who have cancer."
358,"If you have urinary incontinence or if your incontinence problem seems to be getting worse, take stock of your medicine cabinet. Commonly used drugs could be the cause of your incontinence, or at least be a contributing factor. If you suspect medications may be worsening urinary leakage or even causing it, let your doctor know about all the medicines you take, both prescription and over-the-counter. That way, your doctor can help determine whether these medicines should be adjusted or stopped, or if a treatment should be modified. Here are the most common drugs that can worsen or cause urinary incontinence: Also called alpha-adrenergic antagonists or alpha blockers, these high blood pressure drugs -- including Cardura, Minipress, and Hytrin -- work by dilating blood vessels to reduce blood pressure. In fact, they are often prescribed to men to help with urination problems. In men with an enlarged prostate, a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, alpha blockers can help relax the muscles in the bladder neck, letting urine flow more easily and improving symptoms of BPH. In women, alpha blockers can relax the bladder, too. Women taking an alpha blocker who are experiencing urinary incontinence should also ask their doctor if there is an alternative medication available to treat their high blood pressure. While a few antidepressants actually help urinary incontinence ( Tofranil and Elavil), most can worsen symptoms, at least in some people, Appell tells Web MD. Antidepressants can impair the ability of the bladder to contract, worsening symptoms of overflow incontinence, because the bladder can't empty completely. Other antidepressants may decrease your awareness of the need to go to the bathroom. If you think your antidepressant is worsening your incontinence, talk to your doctor about switching to another medication. Commonly called ""water pills,"" diuretics work in the kidney to reduce blood pressure by flushing excess water and salt out of the body. "" If you take your diuretic, you are making more urine,"" says David Ginsberg, MD, a urologist and associate professor of clinical urology at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles. That translates to more bathroom visits and a worsening of incontinence symptoms, he says. "" If you need the diuretic, you need it,"" says Ginsberg. But he recommends you pay more attention to the recommended incontinence treatments, following your doctor's instructions to the letter. That may mean paying more attention to doing Kegel exercises, designed to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Weakened pelvic floor muscles are often the cause of a common type of urinary incontinence called stress incontinence, in which small amounts of urine are leaked, especially when you cough, sneeze, or laugh. Once you learn how to do Kegel exercises correctly (ask your gynecologist or internist for help), you can do them nearly anytime -- even while driving a car or watching TV or sitting at your desk. If nighttime incontinence is a problem, you might ask your doctor if you could take the diuretic in the morning, suggests Jennifer Anger, MD, MPH, a urologist at Cedars- Sinai Medical Group in Los Angeles. That way, the volume of urine would be greater in the morning and hopefully taper off as the day goes on. Only a small percent of people with incontinence have a problem with bed-wetting, according to Anger, who estimates that about 10% of patients with incontinence wet the bed. However, sleeping pills may pose a problem for those with incontinence at night. "" Sleeping pills can make things worse, because people don't wake up [when their bladder is full],"" she says. As an alternative, cut down on caffeine so you sleep better on your own, Anger suggests. Sleep will come more easily if you keep a regular bedtime and wake-up schedule, according to the National Sleep Foundation. You can also develop a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as reading a book or listening to soothing music. Bringing up the topic of urinary incontinence with your doctor or your spouse is never easy; most people are at least a bit embarrassed. But open communication can help you find out about the causes of incontinence and whether your medications may be contributing. One good opener might be something like this: "" I have been having bladder troubles."" If you will be visiting a new doctor, and have not yet selected him or her, you might seek out a doctor of the same sex, if you think that would help you feel more comfortable. Or, you might bring up the topic first with your doctor's nurse. Preparing for the conversation about urinary incontinence may help you feel more in control. That means being able to answer the questions your doctor is likely to ask, including: When did your urinary incontinence symptoms begin? Have you had urinary incontinence symptoms before? What drugs are you on, and when did you start each of them? Do you leak urine with physical activity, coughing or sneezing? You may find it easier to talk about incontinence if you acknowledge it as a medical condition that needs treatment, just as high blood pressure, arthritis, or high cholesterol does. Treatment options for urinary incontinence are plentiful."
359,"If you have restless legs syndrome, or RLS, you know that tugging or pulling feeling in your legs. You might feel an overpowering urge to move them, especially at night. This can make it really hard to sleep. There is no cure for RLS, but there are some non-drug steps you can try to get relief from your symptoms. Here are a few. Good sleep routine. Throwing off your sleep pattern can make your RLS symptoms worse. Try going to bed at the same time every night and getting up at the same time every morning. To get deep sleep, it may help to go to bed a little later and get up later. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and comfortable. Keep the TV and computer out of the bedroom. Take iron. Because low levels of iron might be linked to RLS, your doctor will likely suggest taking iron supplements. Other supplements. There's not a lot of research to back it up, but some people get relief from RLS symptoms by taking folic acid, magnesium, or vitamin B12. Change your temperature. Try a cool shower or a soak in a warm bath before bedtime. Experiment with either a heating pad or an ice pack on your legs. Sometimes just a change in temperature helps. Massage . Rubbing your muscles, especially your calves, may help ease your pain and symptoms. Try massage right before bed to see if it helps you get a more restful night's sleep. Exercise . Regular, mild exercise during the day may help. Take a short walk or try some simple stretching exercises before bed. Be careful you don't exercise too hard, even if it's early in the day. Too much or too vigorous exercise can make your RLS symptoms worse. Stress relief . Stress can cause your RLS to flare and make symptoms worse. Find ways that help you relax and calm your anxiety. You might want to try deep breathing, yoga, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or tai chi. Electrical stimulation. Sometimes stimulating your feet and toes with vibrations or electrical impulses can give relief from RLS symptoms. Some people have success when they do this for a few minutes before they go to sleep. Ask your doctor for more information. Acupuncture. There's no hard proof that acupuncture helps with symptoms, yet many people with RLS give it a try to relieve symptoms."
360,"Chlorella is a type of freshwater seaweed (green algae). It contains protein, iron, vitamins B and C, and other antioxidants. It may contain substances that fight bacteria, fungi, tumors, and viruses. Chlorella may help your immune system work better. Some evidence suggests chlorella may: Help people with certain tumors better tolerate chemotherapy and radiation. Raise white blood cell count in people with HIV or cancer, which helps your body fight infections. Protect against cell damage from radiation and toxic metals, such as lead. Chlorella may also increase the amount of healthy bacteria in your intestines. Healthy bacteria help prevent stomach upset, diarrhea, and other symptoms. Chlorella has been used to try to treat gastrointestinal disorders, including: Constipation Diverticulitis Inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) Stomach ulcers Chlorella has also been used to try to treat or prevent: Asthma attacks Bad breath Fibromyalgia High cholesterol High blood pressure Low B-12 levels Premenstrual syndrome ( PMS) Trichomoniasis (a sexually transmitted infection) White patches on genitals called vulvar leukoplakia Some people also take chlorella to try to: Boost energy levels Detox the body Improve mental function More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of chlorella to treat these conditions. Chlorella is used as a food additive in Japan. Studies suggest that chlorella may be safe when taken by mouth for a short amount of time, up to two months. Side effects of chlorella include: Bloating Diarrhea Fatigue Gas Green-colored stools Nausea Stomach cramps Allergic reactions have been reported in some people taking chlorella. These reactions have included severe breathing problems and a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. There isn't enough research to know if chlorella is safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Chlorella may make it harder for warfarin and other blood-thinning drugs to work. Some chlorella supplements may contain iodine, so people with thyroid conditions may want to avoid taking chlorella. Always tell your doctor about any supplements you are taking, including natural ones and those bought without a prescription. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with any medications. Supplements are not regulated by the FDA in the same way that food and drugs are. The FDA does not review these supplements for safety or efficacy before they hit the market."
361,"If you have a condition that causes inflammation, it may help to change your eating habits. While medication and other treatments are important, many experts say that adopting an anti-inflammatory diet may help, too. If you have, say, rheumatoid arthritis, changing what's on your plate won't be a magic cure -- but it might lessen the number of flare-ups that you have, or it may help take your pain down a few notches. An anti-inflammatory diet is widely regarded as healthy, so even if it doesn't help with your condition, it can help lower your chances of having other problems. In a nutshell, anti-inflammatory foods are those that any mainstream nutrition expert would encourage you to eat. They include lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant-based proteins (like beans and nuts), fatty fish, and fresh herbs and spices. Fruits and veggies: Go for variety and lots of color. Research has shown that vitamin K-rich leafy greens like spinach and kale curb inflammation, as does broccoli and cabbage. And the substance that gives fruits like cherries, raspberries, and blackberries their color is a type of pigment that also helps fight inflammation. Whole grains: Oatmeal, brown rice, whole-wheat bread, and other unrefined grains tend to be high in fiber, and fiber also may help with inflammation. Beans: They're high in fiber, plus they're loaded with antioxidants and other anti-inflammatory substances. Nuts: They have a healthy kind of fat that helps stop inflammation. ( Olive oil and avocados are also good sources.) Stick to just a handful of nuts a day; otherwise, the fat and calories will add up. Fish: Put it on your plate at least twice a week. Salmon, tuna, and sardines all have plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, which fight inflammation. Herbs and spices: They add antioxidants (along with flavor) to your food. Turmeric, found in curry powder, has a strong substance called curcumin. And garlic curbs the body's ability to make things that boost inflammation. Anything highly processed, overly greasy, or super sweet isn't a good choice for you if you have inflammation. Sweets, cakes and cookies, and soda: They're not dense in nutrients, and they're easy to overeat, which can lead to weight gain, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol (all related to inflammation). Sugar causes the body to release inflammatory messengers called cytokines. Soda and other sweet drinks are main culprits. Anti-inflammatory diet experts often say you should cut out all added sugars, including agave and honey. High-fat and processed red meat (like hot dogs): These have a lot of saturated fat, which can cause inflammation if you get more than a small amount each day. Butter, whole milk, and cheese: Again, the problem is saturated fat. Instead, eat low-fat dairy products. They're not considered inflammatory. French fries, fried chicken, and other fried foods: Cooking them in vegetable oil doesn't make them healthy. Corn, safflower, and other vegetable oils all have omega-6 fatty acids. You need some omega-6s, but if you get too much, as most Americans do, you throw off the balance between omega-6s and omega-3s in your body and end up with -- you guessed it -- more inflammation. Coffee creamers, margarine, and anything else with trans fats: Trans fats (look on the label for ""partially hydrogenated oils"") raise LDL cholesterol, which causes inflammation. There's no safe amount to eat, so steer clear. Wheat, rye, and barley: The focus here is gluten, and this one's a controversial maybe. People who have celiac disease need to avoid gluten. But for everyone else, the science is solid that whole grains are beneficial."
362,"Calcium channel blockers are prescription medications that relax blood vessels and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while also reducing the heart's workload. Examples of calcium channel blockers include: Amlodipine ( Norvasc) Bepridil ( Vascor) Diltiazem ( Cardizem, Cardizem CD, Cardizem SR, Dilacor XR, Diltia XT, Tiazac) Felodipine ( Plendil) Nicardipine ( Cardene, Cardene SR) Nifedipine ( Adalat, Adalat CC, Procardia, Procardia XL) Nisoldipine, ( Sular) Verapamil ( Calan, Calan SR, Covera- HS, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Verelan, Verelan PM) Caduet is a combination of a statin cholesterol drug and amlodipine. Heart conditions that calcium channel blockers might be prescribed for: High blood pressure (especially in African Americans) Coronary artery disease Coronary spasm Angina (chest pain) Abnormal heart rhythms Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diastolic heart failure (preserved left ventricular function) Raynaud's syndrome (a circulatory problem affecting blood vessels in the hands and feet) Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of your lungs) If you have systolic heart failure, then amlodipine and felodipine are the only calcium channel blockers you should use. Calcium channel blockers can also prevent migraine headaches. Calcium channel blockers should be taken with food or milk. Follow the label directions on how often to take it. The number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and how long you need to take it will depend on the type of medication your doctor prescribed and why. You should check your blood pressure regularly. Ask your doctor how often. You may need to take and record your pulse daily. If it's slower than your doctor said it should be, call your doctor or nurse to find out if you should still take your calcium channel blocker that day. Side effects of calcium channel blockers can include: Lightheadedness Low blood pressure Slower heart rate Drowsiness Constipation Swelling of feet ankles and legs Increased appetite. Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) Tenderness or bleeding of the gums Sexual dysfunction Let your doctor know if these side effects are severe or don't go away. Contact your doctor right away if you: Gain weight Have trouble breathing (shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing) Get a skin rash or hives Are very lightheaded or faint Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you're taking a calcium channel blocker. Avoid alcohol because it can change how calcium channel blockers work and make the side effects worse. Your doctor needs to know about all the medications you're taking, to avoid problems with calcium channel blockers. Talk to your doctor before you take anything new, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements. Calcium channel blockers can be used during pregnancy to manage high blood pressure and preeclampsia. However, you should always consult with your doctor before taking calcium channel blockers during pregnancy. These drugs may pass into breast milk, but no adverse effect on breastfed infants has been found. Discuss the risks and benefits of using calcium channel blockers while breastfeeding with your doctor. The safety of calcium channel blockers in children has not been established; however, no problems have been found to date. Discuss the risks and benefits of giving your child calcium channel blockers with your child's doctor. Older adults have more side effects from calcium channel blockers than younger people. Doctors usually prescribe lower doses."
363,"Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that involves difficulty reading. Testing and screening for dyslexia are available and are very important. Without proper diagnosis and instruction, dyslexia can lead to frustration, school failure, and low self-esteem. An assessment for dyslexia includes reading or writing while the tester looks for signs of dyslexia, such as adding, dropping, or changing words; pulling words from other lines; or reversing or transposing words and letters. While not diagnostic in itself, body language may provide a clue: A person with dyslexia may frequently clear his or her throat, tap a pencil, or fidget during the testing out of anxiety about performing the test. Dyslexia is a disorder present at birth and cannot be prevented or cured, but it can be managed with special instruction and support. Early intervention to address reading problems is important. Parents must understand that children with dyslexia can learn normally, but probably need to learn in different ways than children without the condition. Teaching should be individualized and may involve modeling letters and words in clay or other three-dimensional techniques to help the child learn letters and words. If you notice any of the signs of dyslexia, your child's doctor can help determine whether there are physical problems, such as vision problems, that are causing or contributing to your child's condition, and he or she can refer you to specialists who can diagnose and treat learning disorders. These may include an educational specialist, an educational psychologist, or a speech therapist."
364,"You probably already use one or more of the many migraine treatments out there. They can work well. But they don't always. If you still find it hard to stop or prevent your headaches, you'll want to know what else you can try. Cefaly is an electrical stimulation device. The FDA says it's effective and has few risks and side effects when used properly. It may help people who have problems with drug side effects. You wear it like a headband across your forehead. You can use it every day, but not more than once a day: Apply the self-adhesive electrode to your forehead. Connect the headband to the electrode. This starts the flow of electricity to a nerve linked to migraines. You may feel a massaging or tingling sensation. Wear it for 20 minutes. It shuts off automatically. It's the first TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) device approved for treating migraines before they start. Other devices may be available. Ask your doctor. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) was the first medicine specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. In 2018, fremanezumab ( Ajovy) was also aproved. With each, you give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device. Your doctor might recommend this if you have chronic migraines. About every 12 weeks, you get 31 Botox shots around your head and neck. Each session takes 10-15 minutes. After your first session, it may take 10-14 days for your symptoms to improve. If you get migraines on fewer than 14 days a month or you get other types of headaches, Botox isn't your answer. SPG (sphenopalatine ganglion) nerve block. This short, simple procedure numbs the SPG, a group of nerve cells inside and behind your nose. The FDA has approved three devices for doing this. It works because your SPG is linked to your trigeminal nerve, which is involved in these headaches. You get the procedure in your doctor's office. You'll be awake for it. Your doctor will insert a thin plastic tube, called a catheter, into your nose, one nostril at a time. Through an attached syringe, you'll get an anesthetic to numb your SPG and the area around it. Your doctor may use an X-ray machine to be sure the tube is inserted correctly. Once the numbness wears off, you may still feel relief for some time. Several types of counseling can help. In acceptance and commitment therapy ( ACT), you accept that you have some migraine pain instead of trying to control it completely or avoid it. You commit to âgrow awayâ from a focus on migraines to discover goals and values you want more of in your life. And then you take action toward those goals. Mindfulness-based therapy. â Mindfulnessâ is a practice of being aware of your mind and body right now. Distracting thoughts come up, but you let them go. You may find that this helps you manage your migraine pain without being derailed by it. You might also feel less anxious or depressed about it. You simply notice your thoughts, emotions, and body sensations. You'll still need your medicine and other treatments. Mindfulness is an additional practice you can do by yourself."

It's a sugar substitute called stevia. Stevia is about 100 to 300 times sweeter than table sugar, but has no carbohydrates, calories, or artificial ingredients. Not everyone likes the way it tastes. Some people find it bitter, but others think stevia tastes like menthol. Try it in your morning coffee or sprinkled over your oatmeal to see if you like the taste. Stevia is natural, unlike other sugar substitutes. It's made from a leaf related to popular garden flowers like asters and chrysanthemums. In South America and Asia, people have been using stevia leaves to sweeten drinks like tea for many years. Look for stevia in powder or liquid form in supermarkets and health-food stores. You're likely to find it on the baking goods aisle or in the health food aisle. You may even get your sweet caffeine fix without calories or artificial sweeteners. Major U. S. soda companies now sell diet cola soft drinks sweetened with stevia. Some flavored waters also have stevia. If you have diabetes, stevia could be a way to sweeten your yogurt or hot tea without adding carbohydrates. Yes, you can cook with it. Each brand has its own sugar-to-stevia ratio, so check the package before you measure out sweetener. The FDA approved only the purified form of stevia, called stevioside, as safe to use. Products considered safe contain words in their ingredient list such as stevia extract or stevia rebaudiana. If you see whole stevia leaves or crude stevia extracts at your local natural foods store, don't buy them."

Also, it isn't really a specific injury. Runner's knee is a broad term used to describe the pain you feel if you have one of several knee problems. You might hear a doctor call it patellofemoral pain syndrome. Several things can bring it on: Overuse. Bending your knee again and again or doing a lot of high-stress exercises, like lunges and plyometrics (training that uses the way your muscles lengthen and shorten to boost their power), can irritate tissues in and around your kneecap. A direct hit to the knee, like from a fall or blow Your bones aren't lined up (your doctor will call this malalignment). If any of the bones from your hips to your ankles are out of their correct position, including the kneecap, that can put too much pressure on certain spots. Then your kneecap won't move smoothly through its groove, which can cause pain. Problems with your feet, like hypermobile feet (when the joints in and around them move more than they should), fallen arches (flat feet), or overpronation (which means your foot rolls down and inward when you step). These often change the way you walk, which can lead to knee pain. Weak or unbalanced thigh muscles. The quadriceps, those big muscles in the front of your thigh, keep your kneecap in place when you bend or stretch the joint. If they're weak or tight, your kneecap may not stay in the right spot. Chondromalacia patella, a condition in which the cartilage under your kneecap breaks down The main thing is pain. You might notice it: Usually in front of your kneecap, though it could be around or behind it When you bend your knee to walk, squat, kneel, run, or even get up from a chair Getting worse when you walk downstairs or downhill The area around your knee could swell, or you might hear popping or have a grinding feeling in the knee. The doctor will give you a thorough physical exam. He might also do tests that can give him a closer look inside your joint, like X-rays. For most people, runner's knee gets better on its own with time and treatments to address the problem that's causing your pain. To help relieve your pain and speed recovery, you can: Rest your knee. As much as possible, try to avoid things that make it hurt worse, like running, squatting, lunging, or sitting and standing for long periods of time. Ice your knee to ease pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every 3-4 hours for 2-3 days, or until the pain is gone. Wrap your knee. Use an elastic bandage, patellar straps, or sleeves to give it extra support. Elevate your leg on a pillow when you sit or lie down. Take NSAIDs, if needed, like ibuprofen or naproxen. These drugs help with pain and swelling. But they can have side effects, like a higher risk of bleeding and ulcers. Use as directed on the label, unless your doctor says otherwise. Do stretching and strengthening exercises, especially for your quadriceps muscles. Your doctor can recommend a physical therapist to teach you what to do. Try arch supports or orthotics for your shoes. They may help with the position of your feet. You can buy them at the store or get them custom-made. If you try these techniques and your knee still hurts, ask your doctor if you need to see a specialist, like an orthopedic surgeon. It's rare, but you may need surgery for severe cases of runner's knee. An orthopedic surgeon can remove or replace damaged cartilage and, in extreme cases, correct the position of your kneecap to send stress through the joint more evenly. People heal at different rates. Your recovery time depends on your body and your injury. While you get better, you need to take it easy on your knee. That doesn't mean you have to give up exercise. Just try something new that won't hurt your joint. If you're a jogger, swim laps in a pool instead. Whatever you do, don't rush things. If you try to get back to your workouts before you're healed, you could damage the joint for good. Don't return to your old level of physical activity until: You can fully bend and straighten your knee without pain. You feel no pain in your knee when you walk, jog, sprint, or jump. Your knee is as strong as your uninjured knee. Keep your thigh muscles strong and limber with regular exercise. Use shoe inserts if you have problems that may lead to runner's knee. Make sure your shoes have enough support. Try not to run on hard surfaces, like concrete. Stay in shape and keep a healthy weight. Warm up before you work out. Don't make sudden workout changes like adding squats or lunges. Add intense moves slowly. Ask your doctor if you should see a physical therapist. If your doctor or physical therapist suggests it. Try a knee brace when you work out. Wear quality running shoes. Get a new pair of running shoes once yours lose their shape or the sole becomes worn or irregular."
367,"Upper limb spasticity is a condition that affects the way you move your arms. It makes your muscles stiff and flexed. Sometimes, your arms will twitch or move in a way you can't control, called a spasm. Spasticity happens after your body's nervous system has been damaged, usually by a stroke, disease, or injury. It's not life-threatening, but it can be painful and have a big effect on your daily life. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become hard. But the outlook for treating upper limb spasticity is better than it has ever been. There are many treatments that can make your muscles more flexible and give you better control of your arm movements. If your symptoms improve, you may be able to reduce your treatment. Your muscles move when they get electrical signals from the nerves that branch throughout your body. These signals come from your spinal cord and brain. When your brain or spinal cord is damaged, they don't send those signals the right way. The uneven signaling causes your muscles to flex, stiffen, and twitch. There are several things that can damage your brain or nervous system and lead to upper limb spasticity. Strokes, which happen when an artery to your brain is blocked by a clot or it bursts. Without the blood and oxygen they need, brain cells can die, creating problems with some of the nerves in your body. Diseases like multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy, which destroy the nervous system Injuries You may not have any symptoms of upper limb spasticity until weeks, months, or even years after you have a stroke or brain injury. The condition can cause: Stiff arm muscles Twitches or movements that you can't control Trouble using or moving your arms Tightness in the muscles in your elbows, wrists, or fingers Arms that get stuck in uncomfortable positions, such as pressed against your side. Rotated shoulders Bent elbows or wrists Hands clenched into fists Difficulty or pain when you move or straighten your arm, elbows, wrists, or fingers Without treatment, your muscles can seem frozen in these positions. Spasms and stiffness can make it very hard to do normal tasks like dressing yourself. If you notice muscle tightness, spasms, or stiff limbs at any time after you've had a stroke or brain injury, you should tell your doctor right away. You'll need to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the brain and nervous system. She'll give you a physical exam and test your muscle movement to see how well you can control your arms, elbows, wrists, and hands. She'll flex your joints to see how limber they are. She may ask you to move your arms on your own to see how much control you have. The doctor will also ask you questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are having spasms? When did they start? How often do you have them? Does anything make your muscles feel better or worse? Are you having any pain or stiffness? Do you have any trouble doing daily tasks or taking care of yourself? What's hard for you? Your doctor may also use a test called electromyography, or EMG, to see how well your arm muscles and nerves are working. For this test, you'll sit or lie down, and a technician will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles that go into your muscles, and they're attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electricity in your muscles and nerves. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. She may also inject a drug to briefly numb the area where you have spasms to see if they still happen when you can't move your muscles. The test can take 30 minutes to an hour. You'll want to find out as much as you can about your condition so you can learn how to control it and feel better. You might want to ask: What caused my spasticity? What kinds of treatments are there? Which ones would be best for me? How will the medicines make me feel? Do I need physical therapy? How long will I need treatment? What can I do to make my arms less stiff? The goal of treatments for upper limb spasticity is to keep your muscles from becoming too stiff and give you more freedom to move your arms. It's important to get therapy so you can keep moving your muscles and stop them from getting stiffer and more painful. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on how healthy you are and the symptoms you have. There are several options that may work for you. Exercises, like stretches, may help your joints and muscles become more flexible. A physical therapist can teach them to you. Braces or splints hold your muscles and joints in the right position and keep them from getting too tight. Onabotulinumtoxin A ( Botox) and abobotulinumtoxin A ( Dysport), used for the treatment of upper and lower limb spasticity, can relax muscles and ease spasms. Your doctor can give you a shot of it directly into your muscles. Botox and Dysport have some potentially serious side effects such as breathing and swallowing issues, so make sure to discuss them with your physician. Drugs like clonazepam ( Klonopin), diazepam ( Valium), and tizanidine ( Zanaflex) also make your muscles more relaxed. Intrathecal baclofen therapy ( ITB). Baclofen is a drug that corrects the way your nerves send signals to your muscles. ITB delivers it through a pump to an area of the spinal cord, called the intrathecal space, to prevent spasms. Nerve block injections, shots of drugs that numb the nerves that cause muscles to twitch, may stop spasms when other medicines don't work. Surgery to cut connections between nerves or tendons and muscles that spasm. Your doctor may recommend this if other treatments don't work. If your condition gets better, you may be able to reduce your treatment. It's important to stick to your therapy plan and tell your doctor about any changes in how you feel. Along with treatment, there are things you can do to keep your muscles and joints as flexible as possible. Stay as active as you can. Exercise will loosen your muscles and increase your flexibility. Swimming and strength-building activities may especially help. Play games or sports, or try to do normal household tasks to stay active and move stiff limbs. Get enough sleep. If you're tired, your symptoms may get worse. Find ways to relax. Stress can make spasticity worse, so find low-key activities that you enjoy. Try reading, taking a walk, or meditation. Without treatment, upper limb spasticity can make your muscles stiffer and more painful over time. But new treatments can give you better control of your arms and help you live an active life. Your physical therapist or occupational therapist can help you find ways to increase your flexibility or find new, easier ways to do tasks. Find helpful information and support from organizations like the American Stroke Association ( ASA). You can find stroke support groups in your area or to join a group online. Call the ASA at 888-478-7653 to be connected to a trained volunteer who can provide support or offer advice."
368,"Many types of leukemia produce no obvious symptoms in the early stages. Eventually, symptoms may include any of the following: Anemia and related symptoms, such as fatigue, pallor, and a general feeling of illness. A tendency to bruise or bleed easily, including bleeding from the gums or nose, or blood in the stool or urine. Susceptibility to infections such as sore throat or bronchial pneumonia, which may be accompanied by headache, low-grade fever, mouth sores, or skin rash. Swollen lymph nodes, typically in the throat, armpits, or groin. Loss of appetite and weight. Discomfort under the left lower ribs (caused by a swollen spleen). Very high white blood cell counts may result in visual problems due to retinal hemorrhage, ringing of the ears (tinnitus), mental status changes, prolonged erection (priapism), and stroke. You experience any of the symptoms listed in the description section and cannot readily explain their occurrence. Your blood cell count should be tested. You experience unexplained bleeding, high fever, or a seizure. You may need emergency treatment for acute leukemia. You are in remission from leukemia and notice signs of recurrence, such as infection or easy bleeding. You should have a follow-up exam."
369,"You and your doctor may choose immunotherapy to treat your advanced lung cancer. Unlike chemotherapy, which kills both healthy cell and cancer cells, immunotherapy helps your immune system to better target and kill the diseased cells. But side effects can happen. Let your doctor know as soon as you notice them. Early treatment will make them easier to manage. Reactions to Injections You may have pain, swelling, soreness, redness, itchiness, or a rash in the area where the medicine went into your vein. This usually goes away on its own. You can take acetaminophen or an over-the-counter antihistamine to ease the discomfort. Just make sure your doctor says it's OK. Cold compresses can also help. Flu- Like Symptoms You might feel like you have the flu, right down to the fatigue, fever, chills, and muscle and joint aches. Acetaminophen can help, if your doctor OKs it. Drink plenty of fluids. Take small sips of cold water, ginger ale, apple juice, or other clear liquids all day long. A little light exercise can help with fatigue. Move your arms and legs while you lie in bed or sit in your chair. Don't overdo it. Move only as much as your doctor says to. Cough and Shortness of Breath If you doctor gives you medicines to help with your cough and breathing, take them just as prescribed. You can also raise your upper body to a 45-degree angle. Lift the head of the bed (you can put bricks or blocks under it) or prop yourself up with pillows. Pursed-lip breathing may also help. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through puckered lips. If you have a sudden shortness of breath, get medical help right away. Nausea and Loss of Appetite You may just not want to eat, or you could feel nauseated and queasy. There are ways to feel better and get the nutrition you need. Open a window or use a fan to get some fresh air into the room. Getting your body all the liquid it needs will boost your appetite and ease the nausea. Take small sips of water and other clear fluids -- like sports drinks, ginger ale, or tea -- throughout the day. Suck on ice chips, frozen fruit juice chips, or ice pops to boost your overall fluid intake. The cold sensation in your mouth may ease your tummy a bit. If you don't want to eat or feel sick to your stomach, try several small meals a day. Choose high-protein, high-calorie foods. Add butter, sauces, and syrups to your dishes to make them tasty and add some much-needed calories. You can also drink your meals. Milkshakes, smoothies, and protein shakes may go down better than solid food. They're high in calories, and you can add nutrients to them with fruit, veggies, and protein powder. Cold foods like shakes can also be easier when nausea is a problem. Diarrhea or Constipation Bowel trouble is another common side effect of immunotherapy. Some people have diarrhea, while others get constipated. The same home remedies can help with either problem. Drink lots of water or other clear fluids. Avoid sugary drinks and fruit juices. They can make diarrhea worse. Suck on ice chips or ice pops to get more liquids into your system. Light exercise, even just some simple bed- or chair-based movements, can ease constipation. Do as much as you can, within any limits set by your doctor. More Serious Side Effects These drugs take the brakes off your immune system. When it's going full tilt, it can sometimes attack healthy tissues and organs. Your doctors will keep an eye out for inflammation of your organs, including your lungs (pneumonitis), liver (hepatitis), colon (colitis/diarrhea), and thyroid gland. These complications can be serious. But your doctor can control them with medicine. Or he may take you off immunotherapy and try something else."
370,"A diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, can be overwhelming -- and that's a normal reaction. You might not know what to expect. Give yourself time to absorb and adjust to the news. ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, is a disease that affects your motor neurons. These are nerves in your brain and spinal cord that direct your muscles to contract so you can walk, talk, eat, and breathe. As motor neurons die, you'll have a harder and harder time doing these and other activities. Right now, there is no cure for ALS. And it is progressive, meaning it gets worse with time. It's hard to predict what your future will be, because ALS is so different for everyone. Most people live for at least 3 years after their diagnosis. Some people live up to 10 years. As new medicines and treatments for symptoms become available, people will live longer and longer with the disease. Your health care team can help you understand what to expect. A doctor who specializes in ALS will give you access to the latest treatment options, so you'll have the best possible odds. Normally, motor neurons carry signals from your brain to your muscles to tell them to move. As ALS causes your motor neurons to die, you start to lose control over your muscle movements. At first, you might be less steady on your feet than usual. ALS can make it harder to do anything that requires fine movement, such as picking up a pencil or turning a key in a lock. Your hands may feel weak. Or, your muscles might twitch. Over time, you'll lose control over the muscles that help you walk, talk, swallow, and breathe. You'll still be able to see, hear, smell, touch, taste, and use the bathroom. But you'll need help with basic tasks such as getting dressed, eating, or showering. Your condition might get worse quickly or slowly. The doctors and other members of your medical team will help you understand how it has progressed and what you can expect. Though ALS can't be cured, you can do a lot to help yourself feel better. First, learn as much as you can about the disease. Work with your whole medical team to make sure you do everything you can to manage it. Your team might include these professionals: A physical therapist can teach you exercises to keep your muscles strong. A speech and language therapist can show you ways to speak more clearly. An occupational therapist can offer you tools and ways to help you get around more easily. A dietitian can help you plan nutritious meals with the right amount of calories, and choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. A respiratory therapist can teach you exercises to help you breathe more easily. A therapist can help you cope with the emotional issues that come with having ALS. Your neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating the nervous system, will prescribe treatments that can help with symptoms. Two drugs -- edaravone ( Radicava) and riluzole ( Rilutek) -- are FDA-approved to treat ALS. They are not a cure, but if you start taking either of them soon after you're diagnosed, they could help you live longer. Researchers are testing other new ALS treatments in clinical trials. People who take part in these trials get to try medicines and other treatments before they're available to everyone else. Ask your doctor or check with the ALS Association to find out if you can join any of these studies. Another thing you can do is to join an ALS support group. You'll meet other people with ALS, find out about resources that can help you, and learn tips from people who have experience with the disease. You can find a support group through your hospital or the nearest ALS Association chapter."
371,"The name of this condition can be a little confusing. When you have heart failure, it doesn't mean your ticker stopped beating. What's really going on is that your heart can't pump blood as well as a healthy one. The chambers of your heart may respond by stretching to carry more blood to pump through your body. They may become stiffer and thicker. This helps keep blood moving for a while, but in time, your heart muscle walls may get weaker. Your kidneys react by causing your body to hold on to water and salt. Fluid may start to build up in your arms, legs, ankles, feet, lungs, or other organs. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have defined four stages of heart failure to help people understand how the condition changes over time and the kinds of treatments that are used for each. Heart failure can be brought on by many conditions that damage the heart. Coronary artery disease is a problem with the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart. It means less blood flows to your heart muscle. When the arteries narrow or get blocked, your heart becomes starved for oxygen and nutrients and can't pump as well. Heart attack may happen when a coronary artery is blocked suddenly, which stops the flow of blood to your heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy is damage to your heart muscle. It can be caused by artery or blood flow problems, infections, and alcohol and drug abuse. Other diseases or genetic issues can also bring it on. Make sure your doctor knows your family's health history. Conditions that overwork the heart include things like high blood pressure, heart valve disease, thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or heart defects you've had since you were born. Systolic heart failure happens when your heart muscle doesn't squeeze with enough force. When that's the case, it pumps less oxygen-rich blood through your body. With diastolic heart failure, your heart squeezes normally, but the ventricle -- the main pumping chamber -- doesn't relax properly. Less blood can enter your heart, and the blood pressure in your lungs goes up. When that happens, you get fluid in your lungs, legs, and belly. This is the period when you're more likely to get heart failure. You may be in this stage if you have: High blood pressure Diabetes Coronary artery disease Metabolic syndrome Your chances are also greater when you have a history of: Cardiotoxic drug therapy Alcohol abuse Rheumatic fever Family members with cardiomyopathy Your doctor will probably recommend regular exercise and that you stop drinking alcohol, smoking, and using illegal drugs. You'll want to take steps to lower high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you have high blood pressure or had a heart attack, your doctor may prescribe beta-blockers. When you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other heart and blood vessel conditions like coronary artery disease, you may need to take an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB). You're in this phase if you never had symptoms of heart failure but you're diagnosed with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which means the left chamber of your heart doesn't pump well. You may be in this group if you had or have: Heart attack Valve disease Cardiomyopathy Treatment will depend on your situation. Your doctor may suggest an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB), or beta-blockers after a heart attack. They may add an aldosterone inhibitor if your symptoms continue while you're taking beta-blockers and ACE/ ARB medications. Surgery can repair coronary arteries repair and valves, or valves may need to be replaced. Sometimes and implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD) will help. You're in this phase if you have systolic heart failure along with symptoms such as: Shortness of breath Fatigue Less ability to exercise Your doctor may prescribe: ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers Angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitors If your symptoms don't go away, you may need to take: Hydralazine/nitrate combination Diuretics (water pills) and digoxin Aldosterone inhibitor, when your symptoms stay severe with other treatments Devices such as a biventricular pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD) may help. You may need to change some things about your day-to-day life, too: Eat less salt. Lose weight if you're overweight. Drink fewer fluids if necessary. Stop drugs that make your condition worse. You're in this phase if you have systolic heart failure and advanced symptoms after you get medical care. Some of the treatments from stages A, B, and C will help stage D, too. Your doctor may also discuss: Heart transplant Ventricular assist devices Surgery options Continuous infusion of intravenous inotropic drugs"
372,"Ipratropium bromide ( Atrovent) is used to reduce runny nose. How anticholinergic nasal sprays work: When sprayed into each nostril, anticholinergic nasal sprays decrease secretions from the glands lining the nasal passage. This diminishes the symptom of runny nose. Who should not use these medications: Individuals who are allergic to any components of the nasal spray should not take this drug. Use: The usual dosage is 2 sprays in each nostril 2-3 times per day. Drug or food interactions: Since this spray has little or no effect beyond the area applied, it is unlikely to interact with other drugs. Side effects: Anticholinergic nasal sprays may cause an excessively dry nose, thereby causing nosebleeds or irritation. Other side effects include headaches, stuffy nose, upset stomach, and sore throat."
373,"If you have heart failure, you have a lot of choices for treatment. Your doctor may suggest you start with medication and lifestyle changes. If your condition gets worse, you can turn to centers that specialize in treating heart failure for more options, like surgery. It's important to keep up with your medications and take them the way your doctor tells you to. Common types of drugs that treat heart failure are: Aldosterone antagonist ACE inhibitors ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) ARNIs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors) Beta-blockers Blood vessel dilators Calcium channel blockers (unless you have systolic heart failure) Digoxin Diuretics Heart pump medication Potassium or magnesium Selective sinus node inhibitors The goal of surgery is to make your heart work better. Bypass surgery. Routes blood around a blocked artery. Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT). When your heartbeat is off-kilter, it can make heart failure worse. This treatment uses a pacemaker that sends timed electrical impulses to both of your heart's lower chambers (the left and right ventricles) so they pump better and more in sync. Your doctor may call it a biventricular pacemaker. He could also pair it with an ICD (see below). Heart transplant. This is done when heart failure is so severe that it doesn't respond to any other treatments. Heart valve surgery. If a faulty heart valve causes your heart failure, your doctor may recommend repairing or replacing it. A surgeon can repair or replace the valves. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD). This device is similar to a pacemaker. It's put under your skin in your chest. Wires lead through your veins and into your heart to keep track of your heart rhythm. If your heart starts to beat at a dangerous rhythm, or if it stops, the ICD tries to pace your heart or shock it back into normal rhythm. An ICD can also act as a pacemaker and speed your heart up if it's going too slow. Infarct exclusion surgery (modified Dor or Dor procedure). When a heart attack happens in the left ventricle (the lower left chamber of your heart), a scar forms. The scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat, forming what's called an aneurysm. A heart surgeon can remove it. Ventricular assist device. The doctor puts it into the abdomen or chest and attaches it to your heart to help it pump blood to the rest of your body. VADs are most often used in the heart's left ventricle, but they can also be used in the right ventricle or in both ventricles. Monitor your symptoms. Check for changes in how much fluid builds up in your body by weighing yourself every day. Check for swelling, too. See your doctor regularly. He'll make sure you're staying healthy and that your heart failure isn't getting worse. He'll ask to review your weight record and list of medications. If you have questions, write them down and bring them with you to your appointment. Call your doctor if you have urgent concerns. Tell all the doctors you see about your heart failure, the medications you take, and any restrictions you have. Also, tell your heart doctor about any new drugs prescribed by another doctor. If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. Keep to a healthy weight. Control your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes. Exercise regularly. Don't drink alcohol. Eat a healthy diet. Limit the salt you eat to less than 1,500 milligrams each day. Eat foods high in fiber and potassium. Cut back on things high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar. If you need to drop some weight, reduce the number of calories you eat. Exercise regularly. A regular program that's OK'd by your doctor will improve your symptoms and strength and make you feel better. It may also slow your heart failure. Don't overdo it. Plan out your activities and include rest periods during the day. Prevent lung infections. Ask your doctor about flu and pneumonia vaccines. Take your medications as prescribed. Don't stop taking them without first asking your doctor. Even if you have no symptoms, the drugs help your heart pump better. Get emotional or psychological support, if you need it. Don't face things alone. Get the backing you need from social workers, psychologists, clergy, and support groups. Ask your doctor to point you in the right direction. It takes a team to manage heart failure, and you are the key player. Your heart doctor will prescribe your medications and manage other medical problems. Other team members, including nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, exercise specialists, and social workers, will also lend a hand. But it's up to you to take your medicine, change your diet, live a healthy lifestyle, keep your follow-up appointments, and be an active member of the team."
374,"In breast cancer, a sentinel node biopsy pinpoints the first few lymph nodes into which a tumor drains (called the ""sentinel"" node). This helps doctors remove only those nodes of the lymphatic system most likely to contain cancer cells. The sentinel nodes are the first place that cancer is likely to spread. In breast cancer, the sentinel node is usually located in the axillary nodes, under the arm. In a small percentage of cases, the sentinel node is found somewhere else in the lymphatic system of the breast. If the sentinel node is positive, there may be other positive lymph nodes upstream. If it is negative, it is highly likely that all of the upstream nodes are negative. To locate the sentinel nodes, a labeling substance, either a radioactive tracer, blue dye, or both, is injected into the area around the tumor before a mastectomy or lumpectomy is performed. The tracer travels the same path to the lymph nodes that the cancer cells would take, making it possible for the surgeon to determine the one or two nodes most likely to test positive for cancer by either visualizing the color or using a handheld Geiger counter. This method varies in how it is performed among hospitals. Research suggests that the sentinel node biopsy procedure can be useful in determining which lymph nodes to remove, without the risk of complications associated with surgically removing all potentially cancerous nodes. When a lumpectomy or mastectomy is performed, only a few lymph nodes are removed for laboratory analysis using the sentinel node biopsy technique. In traditional lumpectomy or mastectomy procedures, a greater number of the axillary nodes are removed, which may lead to complications after surgery, such as lymphedema, or swelling of the arm or hand."
375,"Ask just about any woman: Breasts can go through changes during a menstrual cycle. They get tender, and even seem to shift a bit in size and shape. Chalk it up to the ebb and flow of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone over the course of your cycle. Breast symptoms are the strongest just before your period starts, and improve either during or right after it. Every woman is different. But it's common to have one or more of the following: Swelling Tenderness Aches Soreness Changes in texture There are a few steps you can take to curb changes in your breasts during your monthly cycle: Eat a diet lower in fat, avoiding high-fat foods. Skip caffeine, which means no coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate. Avoid salt 1 to 2 week before your period starts. Wear a bra that fits you properly and provides good breast support. Aim for a daily cardio workout. While most changes in your breasts shouldn't cause alarm, you should make the call if you notice: Unusual, new, or changing lumps in your breast or under your arm Nipple discharge (aside from breast milk), particularly if it's bloody or brown Severe symptoms that make it hard to sleep, even after you make changes to your diet and exercise routine You should also reach out if you have changes in: The size or shape of your breast that doesn't go away after you get your period Your nipple, such as if it becomes more pointed or turns inward Your breast's skin, including itching, redness, scaling, dimples, or puckering She'll give you a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms and your family's medical history. Most likely, your doctor will ask you questions about your premenstrual breast tenderness, such as whether it happens every time you get your period, whether you've noticed any lumps or discharge, and other symptoms you've noticed. You'll get a breast exam to check for lumps, and you may also need a mammogram or breast ultrasound. Remember, most breast lumps aren't cancer. But you have to see your doctor to be sure. If needed, you may get a biopsy, in which the doctor takes a tiny bit of the lump to test. Your doctor may also suggest a few options to ease symptoms. For instance, taking diuretics, or ""water pills,"" before your period starts may reduce breast swelling and soreness. Hormonal birth control methods can also help. In severe cases, your doctor may refer you to a breast specialist for another exam."

Many are minor, some are just an inconvenience, a few are serious, and some are just plain strange. Perhaps the most common set of side effects for drugs that work inside your body involves the gastrointestinal system. Nearly any drug can cause nausea or an upset stomach, though it may only happen to a handful of people. For drugs used on the outside, skin irritation is a common complaint. To find more about a drug's side effects, look on the label of over-the-counter ( OTC) products or on package inserts or printed materials that you get with prescription drugs. Because the inserts often include a long list of possibilities, you may want to also talk to your pharmacist or doctor about what to expect and watch out for. An allergic reaction could happen with any drug. That can range from itching and rash all the way to a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Some drugs can't help but trigger side effects because of their chemical structure. The common allergy drug diphenhydramine (also known by the brand name Benadryl) is one. Though it eases allergy symptoms, it also blocks the chemical acetylcholine, and that leads to drowsiness and a host of other side effects, including dry mouth. Some drugs have barely noticeable side effects at the right dose. Typically, warfarin ( Coumadin, Jantoven), used to prevent blood clots, usually works well and isn't bothersome, but serious internal bleeding can happen in the wrong situation. Side effects may show up only when a drug is mixed with certain other things. This might be called a drug interaction. For example, drinking alcohol while you're taking narcotic painkillers can cause an accidental overdose. This has led to many deaths. Another example is grapefruit juice, which can affect the blood levels of several drugs, including some blood pressure and cholesterol medicines. Before a drug can come on the market, the FDA must approve it. The New Drug Applications ( NDAs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies have, first and foremost, evidence that the drug has the effect it's supposed to have and is safe. This proof comes from testing the drug, first in animals and then in humans. Once the basic questions of safety and efficacy are settled, the FDA will approve the drug if it deems that its benefits outweigh its risks. Still, sometimes testing doesn't reveal everything about a drug's side effects, and they don't show up until after the medication enters the marketplace and more people start using it. That's where Med Watch comes in. The FDA's post-marketing surveillance program seeks voluntary input, mainly from health care professionals, on unwanted effects they see in ''the real world.'' Sometimes these reports are numerous or serious enough for the FDA to take regulatory action, such as adding warnings to a drug's label. This happened with the psoriasis drug Raptiva. The FDA required that the drug carry the agency's strongest warning, known as a black box warning, after it received reports of brain infections and meningitis in patients taking the drug. The drug was later taken off the market. The FDA also wants input from consumers when it comes to side effects. All prescription drugs, and many OTC products, must be labeled with a toll-free number the agency has for letting it know about side effects with drugs, called ""adverse events."" You can report possible new but severe side effects through Med Watch at 1-800- FDA-1088 or through the FDA website. Sometimes, the post-marketing information coming in to the FDA is so disturbing that a drug is discontinued. Baycol, which lowers cholesterol, was strongly linked to a breakdown of muscle tissue that could be deadly. The drug was approved in 1997, and the manufacturer stopped selling it 4 years later. The anti-inflammatory drug Duract spent just 1 year on the market. It was approved only as a short-term use product, and the FDA found serious liver problems when people took the drug for longer than recommended. Drug companies are also required to report adverse events to the FDA. Failure to do so can lead to prosecution. In 1985, employees of two drug companies were fined or sentenced to community service for not reporting adverse events involving the blood pressure drug Selacryn and arthritis drug Oraflex. Both products were pulled from the market. Not every side effect is a bad one. Some are downright welcome. Take finasteride. Introduced in 1992 to treat noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, it was found to regrow hair. Now it's marketed for that purpose under the name Propecia. Today, millions of men use a low dose of finasteride to treat male pattern baldness. Similarly, minoxidil was originally marketed as a pill for high blood pressure and found to grow hair by people who used it. Today, as a lotion or foam, it's a popular OTC remedy for baldness."
377,"As you get ready to start treatment, it's normal to feel nervous about side effects you might face. To help you prepare, here's a treatment-by-treatment guide to the most common ones. Keep in mind that side effects vary even between two people on the same treatment. That's because every person -- and every cancer case -- is unique. The good news is most side effects are temporary and there are ways you can manage them. Most lung cancer surgeries are a procedure called a thoracotomy. The doctor cuts into your chest and spreads your rib cage open to get to the tumor. This is a major operation, and it takes weeks or months to recover. Based on the size and location of your tumor, the surgeon may be able to do something called minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS). If this works for you, you'll have less pain and you'll get better faster. The side effects will vary based on how much of your lung was removed and which type of procedure you had, but here's an idea of what to expect and how to deal with it. Pain and weakness. Your doctor will prescribe medication to relieve your pain, but you'll need to allow time to rest and heal. It's a good idea to keep a journal so you can track and describe your symptoms. If it gets worse, work with your doctor to adjust medications and fine-tune the dosage. Shortness of breath. You may feel this even though you're getting enough oxygen and you can breathe normally. It's how your brain processes chest pain. It should get better over the next few weeks as you heal. If your lungs are in good shape (other than the cancer) you can usually return to normal life after a while -- even if an entire lung was removed. If you also have a non-cancerous lung disease like emphysema or chronic bronchitis, you may always feel short of breath with some types of activity. These drugs attack cells that divide quickly, which is why they work against cancer cells. But some healthy cells also do this, like those in your hair follicles, bone marrow, and the lining of your mouth and intestines. Chemo attacks them, too, and that leads to certain side effects. They depend on the type and dose of drugs you get and the length of time you take them. They're usually short-term and go away after you're done with treatment. You can take steps to ease them. Report them to your medical team so that they can be treated promptly. Doctors can reduce your dose and delay or stop treatment to keep symptoms from getting worse. Nausea and vomiting. Feeling like you're going to throw up or actually doing it can be a problem on treatment days. Your doctor will give you medicine to keep these symptoms at bay. Hair loss. Follicles, the tiny structures that hair grows out of, contain some of the fastest-growing cells in your body. So chemo attacks them, too. Within a few weeks of starting treatment, you may lose some or all of your hair. The good news is that it's almost always temporary. It can make you feel better to cut or shave before it starts to fall out. If you opt to go bald, use an electric shaver so you don't cut your scalp. If you get a wig, shop for it while you still have hair so you can match it to your current hair color. Bleeding or clotting problems. Platelets are blood cells that help stop bleeding. They plug damaged blood vessels and help your blood clot. If you don't have enough of them, you may bleed or bruise more easily than usual, even from a minor injury. Your doctor will check your platelet count often during your treatment. If it falls too low, you may need a transfusion. Loss of appetite. Instead of three large meals per day, have five or six small ones. Avoid greasy, salty, sweet, or spicy food that might make you feel queasy. If even the smell of food is a turnoff, eat cold meals instead. Diarrhea. Frequent bowel movements that are loose or watery can get in the way of your daily life. They can also drain too much liquid from your body. Skip dairy and high-fiber, greasy, or spicy foods. Drink water or suck on ice chips, and call you doctor if your symptoms last more than a day. Constipation. If you don't go often enough, or if it hurts, you can be more likely to get hemorrhoids or have other problems. Eat more high ­fiber foods like whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. If these lifestyle changes don't help, talk to your doctor. Fatigue. Medications, lack of sleep, and pain can leave you feeling tired and weak. You'll likely be most tired in the days right after treatment. You'll start to feel better over time -- until the next treatment. Take short naps during the day to revive yourself. Soak in the tub before bedtime to help you sleep better. Your friends and family may ask how they can help. Let them! Better yet, assign them tasks like cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. Infections. They can be life-threatening if you're on chemo. Take your temperature any time you feel too warm, too cold, or just not well. If your reading is 100.4 F or higher, call your doctor right away. Wash your hands often to get rid of harmful bacteria. Ask the people around you to do the same. It's a lot like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Before treatments start, the radiation team will take precise measurements to adjust the size and shape of the beam. That makes sure it hits the tumor. The beam destroys cancer cells on impact, but it can also damage healthy cells around them. The procedure itself is painless, but you could have side effects. Some are the same as those with chemo and surgery, and you can treat them the same way. Shortness of breath Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Hair loss Loss of appetite Other side effects can include: Skin changes in the area being treated. These can range from mild redness to blistering and peeling. Clean it each day with warm water and a mild soap that your nurse says is safe to use. Don't use other products on the treatment area unless your doctor or nurse approves them. Sore throat. Your windpipe and esophagus, which are in the middle of your chest, may be exposed to radiation. That could cause a sore throat and trouble when you swallow. This can make it hard to eat anything other than soft foods or liquids for a while. Doctors have found new drugs that target the changes that cause cells to grow into cancer. They don't affect your body the way that standard chemo drugs do, but they can still cause side effects. Skin problems. You might have rashes. Tell your doctor if you notice any skin changes. If you don't treat them, they can get worse and lead to infections. High blood pressure. Your doctor will watch your readings closely if you are getting a drug that can cause this reaction. Heart damage. Your doctor will test your heart before treatment and watch your condition closely. The newest approach to lung cancer treatment uses drugs to help your immune system spot and destroy cancer cells better. It shows great promise when traditional treatments fail, especially for people whose cancer is in a later stage. The most common side effects are flu-like symptoms, fatigue, rashes, fever, and drops in blood pressure. But immunotherapy is very new, so doctors still aren't sure which side effects will happen or how serious they may be."
378,"Asthma medication plays a key role in how well you control your condition. There are two main types of treatment, each geared toward a specific goal. Controller medicationsare the most important because they prevent asthma attacks. When you use these drugs, your airways are less inflamed and less likely to react to triggers. Quick-relief medications -- also called rescue medications -- relax the muscles around your airway. If you have to use a rescue medication more than twice a week, your asthma isn't well-controlled. But people who have exercise-induced asthma may use a quick-acting med called a beta-agonist before a workout. The right medication should allow you to live an active and normal life. If your asthma symptoms aren't controlled, ask your doctor to help you find a different treatment that works better. Some of these drugs should be taken daily to get your asthma under control and keep it that way. Others are taken on an as needed basis to reduce the severity of an asthma attack. The most effective ones stop airway inflammation. Your doctor may suggest you combine an inhaled corticosteroid, an anti-inflammatory drug with other drugs such as: Long-acting beta-agonists. A beta-agonist is a type of drug called a bronchodilator, which opens your airways. Long-acting anticholinergics. Anticholinergics relax and enlarge (dilate) the airways in the lungs, making breathing easier (bronchodilators). Tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva Respimat) is an anticholinergic available for anyone ages 6 and older. This medicine should be used in addition to your regular maintenance medication. Leukotriene modifiers block chemicals that cause inflammation. Mast cell stabilizers curb the release of chemicals that cause inflammation. Theophylline is a bronchodilator used as an add-on medication for symptoms that are not responding to other medications. An immunomodulator is an injection given if you have moderate to severe asthma related to allergies or other inflammation caused by the immune system that doesn't respond to certain drugs. Reslizumab ( Cinqair) is an immunomodulator maintenance medication. It is used along with your regular asthma medicines. This medicine is given every 4 weeks as an intravenous injection over a period of about an hour. This drug works by reducing the number of a specific type of white blood cells, called eosinophils, that play a role in causing asthma symptoms. It can reduce severe asthma attacks. Mepolizumab ( Nucala) targets the levels of blood eosinophils. It is given as an injection every 4 weeks and is used as a maintenance therapy medication. Omalizumab ( Xolair) is an antibody that blocks immunoglobulin E ( Ig E) and is used as an asthma maintenance medication. This prevents an allergen from triggering an asthma attack. This drug is given as an injection. To receive this medicine, a person has to have an elevated Ig E level and have known allergies. The allergies need to be confirmed by either blood or skin test. These medications provide fast relief of asthma attack symptoms like cough, chest tightness, and wheezing. They include: Short-acting beta-agonists (bronchodilators) Anticholinergics. These are bronchodilators that can be paired with, or used instead of, short-acting beta-agonists. Systemic corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that get symptoms under control. There are a few ways to take asthma medications. Some are inhaled, using a metered dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or a nebulizer (which changes medication from a liquid to a mist). Others are taken by mouth, either in pill or liquid form. They can also be given by injection. Some asthma drugs can be taken together. And some inhalers mix two different medications to get the drugs to your airways quicker. Over-the-counter medications for asthma are generally discouraged. You should talk to a doctor about your asthma symptoms and follow his treatment guidelines. OTC medications are not long-term treatments and shouldn't be relied upon daily to control your asthma. People with high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disease, or heart disease should avoid them. Children who get allergy shots are less likely to get asthma, recent studies show, but there are asthma shots specifically for adolescents and adults. Since allergies are an asthma trigger, it makes sense that if you control them, you'll have fewer asthma attacks. Ask your doctor if allergy shots might work for you. Asthma can't be cured. How often you need to take your medications depends on how severe your condition is and how frequently you have symptoms. For example, if you only have trouble when you exercise, you may only need to use an inhaler before a workout. But most people with asthma need daily treatment. Your medications are the foundation of good asthma control. Learn all you can about them. Know what treatments are included in your asthma action plan, when these drugs should be taken, their expected results, and what to do when you don't get the results you want. Keep these general guidelines in mind, too. Never run out of asthma medication. Call your pharmacy or doctor's office at least 48 hours before you run out. Store your pharmacy phone number, prescription numbers, and drug names and doses in the notes app on your phone so you can easily call for refills. Make sure you understand and can follow your asthma treatment plan. Wash your hands before you take asthma drugs. Take your time. Double-check the name and dosage of all medications before you use them. Store asthma drugs according to their instructions. Check liquid medications often. If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and get new ones. Tell your doctor about any other medications you take. Some drugs don't work well when you take them together. Most asthma medications are safe, but some do cause side effects. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to describe them and report anything unusual or severe."
379,"When you're diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early stage, usually stage I or II, it means the disease hasn't spread outside your prostate gland. That means you have a few good treatment options to choose from. It's important to pick one that's right for your condition and one that will give you the best quality of life. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and side effects of each type. Ask a lot of questions, so you can find the therapy that will give you the best results, with the fewest risks. Doctors usually recommend three main types of treatment for prostate cancer in its early stages: Watchful waiting or active surveillance Surgery Radiation therapy Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. You might not need to treat it right away -- or at all -- especially if you're older or have other health issues. For some men, the treatments themselves have risks that are greater than the benefit of getting rid of the cancer. Watchful waiting may be an option in this case. It means you and your doctor will look out for symptoms and treat them if they start. The doctor may do tests from time to time to see if the cancer is growing. Active surveillance might be a choice if the cancer is likely to grow very slowly, if at all, but you would still want to cure it if it does get worse. Your doctor will do tests, including PSA blood tests and rectal exams, usually about every 3-6 months to check on the cancer. You might also have a biopsy, where your doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your prostate and checks it under a microscope. These options don't mean that you ignore your cancer. Your doctor will keep a close eye on your health to be sure the disease doesn't cause any problems for you. If it does, your doctor will talk to you about starting treatment. Because the cancer hasn't spread beyond your prostate in stage I or II, surgery to remove the gland can sometimes cure the disease. The main operation doctors do is called a radical prostatectomy. The surgeon will remove the whole organ, plus some of the tissue around it. There are a couple of ways your doctor can do this: Retropubic prostatectomy. This is the most common type of prostate surgery. A surgeon removes the prostate through a cut on your lower belly. Perineal prostatectomy. The surgeon removes the prostate through a cut between your anus and testicles. Doctors can also do prostatectomy through very small cuts in your pelvis using tiny tools. This technique is called laparoscopy, and the cuts are smaller than in the other operations. A surgeon can also use robotic arms to control the surgical tools and make more precise cuts, called robotic surgery. Your surgeon will try not to damage nerves and other structures around your prostate during surgery, but sometimes, it's not possible. If your cancer has spread to those nerves, doctors will have to remove them. If that happens, you might have side effects afterward, including: A leaky bladder or trouble controlling your urine Trouble getting or keeping an erection or having orgasms Loss of your ability to get a woman pregnant Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. You can get it in one of two ways: External beam radiation therapy focuses X-rays on your prostate from a machine outside your body. The doctor will direct the radiation right to the gland and adjust the dose to target the cancer. The treatment takes just a few minutes, and it doesn't hurt. You'll probably go in to a clinic and get it 5 days per week for about 7 to 9 weeks. Newer forms of this technique use tiny particles called protons instead of X-rays. Proton therapy better targets prostate tissue in hopes of causing less damage to other parts, but it's not available at many medical centers. Brachytherapy uses small pellets, about the size of rice grains, which slowly give off low levels of radiation inside your prostate for a few weeks or months. Doctors will give you medicine to put you to sleep or make your body numb, then put the pellets in through thin needles. You may have to stay away from pregnant women and children during this treatment. Doctors can also give the radiation through small tubes that they place in your prostate for a few minutes at a time. Your doctor will do everything possible to keep from harming the area around your prostate, but some men have side effects from radiation, such as: Diarrhea, blood in their stool, and other bowel problems Trouble controlling urination, or a leaky bladder Erection problems Feeling tired Radiation and surgery are the main treatments for early-stage prostate cancer. But other options include: Cryosurgery. This treatment uses very cold gas to freeze and kill cancer cells. Side effects include blood in your urine, bladder and bowel problems, and trouble getting an erection. Hormone therapy. Male hormones like testosterone can make prostate cancer cells grow. If your doctor thinks your disease could come back after surgery, you might get therapy to stop your body from making those substances. Another type of hormone therapy prevents cancer cells from receiving testosterone. You might get it along with radiation treatments. Side effects can include a lower sex drive, erection problems, and bone thinning."
380,"Varices are dilated blood vessels in the esophagus or stomach caused by portal hypertension. They cause no symptoms unless they rupture and bleed, which can be life-threatening. Someone with symptoms of bleeding varices should seek treatment immediately. Doctors can stop the bleeding and help prevent varices from coming back. Symptoms include: Vomiting of blood Black, tarry, or bloody stool Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Lightheadedness Shock (in severe cases) Bleeding from varices is a medical emergency. If the bleeding is not controlled quickly, a person may go into shock or die. Even after the bleeding has been stopped, there can be serious complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, confusion, and coma. Portal hypertension is an increase in the pressure within the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver). It's often due to scarring of the liver, or cirrhosis. This increased pressure in the portal vein causes blood to be pushed away from the liver to smaller blood vessels, which are not able to handle the increased amount of blood. This leads to the development of large, swollen veins (varices) within the esophagus, stomach, rectum, and umbilical area (around the belly button). The varices are fragile and can rupture easily, resulting in a large amount of blood loss. In severe cases, a person may need to be placed temporarily on a breathing machine to prevent the lungs from filling with blood. Antibiotics are also given immediately to reduce the risk of sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection. Aside from the urgent need to stop the bleeding, treatment is also aimed at preventing more bleeding. Procedures that help treat bleeding varices include: Banding. A gastroenterologist places small rubber bands directly over the varices. This will stop the bleeding and get rid of the varices. Sclerotherapy. A gastroenterologist directly injects the varices with a blood-clotting solution instead of banding them. Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt ( TIPS). A radiological procedure in which a stent (a tubular device) is placed in the middle of the liver. The stent connects the hepatic vein with the portal vein. This procedure is done by placing a catheter through a vein in the neck. It is done to relieve the high blood pressure that has built up in the portal vein and the liver. Distal Splenorenal Shunt ( DSRS). A surgical procedure that connects the splenic vein to the left kidney vein in order to reduce pressure in the varices and control bleeding. Liver transplant . A liver transplant may be done in cases of end-stage liver disease. Devascularization. A surgical procedure that removes the bleeding varices. This procedure is done when a TIPS or a surgical shunt isn't possible or unsuccessful in controlling the bleeding. Esophageal transection. A surgical procedure in which the esophagus is cut through and then stapled back together after the varicies have been tied off. Sometimes there is bleeding at the staple line Treating the underlying cause of bleeding varices can help prevent their return. Earlier treatment of liver disease may prevent them from developing. Certain medications, including the class of heart drugs called ""beta-blockers,"" may reduce elevated portal pressure and lower the likelihood of bleeding. Long-acting nitroglycerines are also used for this purpose. Also, talk with your doctor about possible procedures that can be done and that have an effect on bleeding."
381,"If you've been on your share of amusement park rides, you probably know what vertigo is like -- the feeling that the world is spinning around you. But if you feel dizzy and didn't just step off a roller coaster, check with your doctor to see if you've got one of the two most common forms of vertigo: central and peripheral. There are drugs and other treatments for both types. Finding out which one you've got -- and what's causing it -- can help you and your doctor decide how to manage it. Keep in mind that vertigo is a symptom of a medical condition, not a disease by itself. Your doctor will try to figure out what's behind it. If your doctor tells you that you have peripheral vertigo, you've got plenty of company. It's the most common type of vertigo. Most cases are caused by a problem in the inner ear, which controls your balance. The most common causes of the inner ear trouble that leads to peripheral vertigo are: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV) Vestibular neuronitis Meniere's disease BPPV is a condition that causes small crystals to get loose and start to float in the fluid of your inner ear. The movement of the crystals and the fluid leads you to feel dizzy. Sometimes an ear injury can lead to BPPV. Vestibular neuronitis causes severe dizziness that comes on suddenly and lasts for 2 to 3 weeks. Doctors think an infection with a virus may be the cause. Meniere's disease is condition that combines symptoms of dizziness with occasional hearing loss. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, though stress can be a trigger, along with eating salt or drinking caffeine and alcohol. There are some other conditions of the inner ear that also lead to peripheral vertigo, including: Labyrinthitis Perilymph fistula Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome ( SSCDS) Labyrinthitis may be caused by a viral infection of your inner ear. Perilymph fistula may be due to a head injury or sudden pressure change, such as from scuba diving. SSCDS may be due to a breakdown of part of a bony part of a canal that carries fluids in your inner ear. Nausea and vomiting, sweating, and ear problems are all common symptoms that you may have along with vertigo. If your peripheral vertigo is caused by an inner ear infection or a disease, you may have some pain or a feeling of fullness in your ear. In labyrinthitis and Meniere's disease, you may have hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing of the ears) in one or both ears along with the vertigo. There are some common features of peripheral vertigo that can help your doctor make a diagnosis. Vertigo that starts without warning, and stops just as quickly, is more likely to be peripheral vertigo. Your eyes may also move without your control. This movement may go away when you try to focus your vision on a fixed point. It also tends to only happen during the first few days of vertigo symptoms and then disappears. You can treat peripheral vertigo by managing the condition that's causing it. BPPV, the most common cause of peripheral vertigo, can be treated with a 15-minute exercise known as the Epley maneuver. This series of movements, done in your doctor's office, helps return the crystals that control balance to the correct place in your inner ear. Anti-inflammatory drugs can sometimes help ease symptoms if your peripheral vertigo is caused by vestibular neuronitis, Meniere's disease, or labyrinthitis. Meniere's disease can also be controlled by cutting down on salt, caffeine, and alcohol and lowering your stress. For some conditions, such as perilymph fistula or SSCDS, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct problems in your inner ear. Some conditions causing peripheral vertigo may be chronic, meaning they are ongoing. In these situations, you'll need a combination of balance exercises, lifestyle changes, and medication to manage the vertigo. Motion sickness medicine may also help ease nausea. Your doctor may also prescribe medicines that help reduce balance problems. Central vertigo is caused by a disease or injury to the brain, such as: Head injuries Illness or infection Multiple sclerosis Migraines Brain tumors Strokes Transient ischemic attacks (""mini"" strokes that last for a short time and don't cause permanent damage) While episodes of peripheral vertigo tend to pass quickly, central vertigo often comes without warning and may last for long periods of time. The episodes are generally much more intense than peripheral, and you may be unable to stand or walk without help. Eye movement that you can't control happens in both types of vertigo. But in central vertigo this eye movement lasts longer (weeks to months during vertigo episodes) and it does not go away when you're asked to focus on a fixed point. The hearing problems that frequently happen in peripheral vertigo are rare with central vertigo. But other symptoms -- like headaches, weakness, or trouble swallowing -- are common with central vertigo. Finding out the root cause of the vertigo and treating it is the only way to manage central vertigo. If migraines are the cause, for instance, medication and reducing your stress may help. For some ongoing conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and some tumors, treatment may consist of managing the symptoms. This may include medicines for nausea and drugs that help lessen the sensation of movement."
382,"Blood is spurting from the wound Bleeding cannot be stopped after 5-10 minutes of firm and steady pressure 1. Stop Bleeding Apply firm pressure until bleeding stops. If finger or part of finger is severed, put the severed part in a clean plastic bag, pack the bag in ice, and take it with you to the doctor. 2. Clean Wound Wash with fresh water. Apply antibacterial cream to reduce risk of infection. Apply a sterile bandage. 3. Control Swelling Apply ice to a bruised or swollen finger. 4. When to See a Doctor Inability to move the finger Numbness Bone is exposed The wound is deep or long. Pain and swelling are severe or persistent. You can't clean the wound or the wound is very dirty. ( You may need antibiotics) The injury is a puncture or open wound and you haven't had a tetanus shot in the last 10 years. The injury is from a human or animal bite. If the wound doesn't heal or shows signs of infection: redness, swelling, pain, or pus."
383,"Tourette's syndrome is a problem with the nervous system that causes people to make sudden movements or sounds, called tics, that they can't control. For example, someone with Tourette's might blink or clear their throat over and over again. Some people may blurt out words they don't intend to say. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Treatments can control tics, but some people don't need any unless their symptoms really bother them. About 100,000 Americans have full-blown Tourette's syndrome, but more people have a milder form of the disease. It often starts in childhood, and more boys than girls get it. Symptoms often get better as children grow up. For some people, they go away completely. Tourette's has been linked to different parts of the brain, including an area called the basal ganglia, which helps control body movements. Differences there may affect nerve cells and the chemicals that carry messages between them. Researchers think the trouble in this brain network may play a role in Tourette's. Doctors don't know exactly what causes these problems in the brain, but genes probably play a role. It's likely that there is more than one cause. People who have family members with Tourette's are more likely to get it themselves. But people in the same family may have different symptoms. The main symptom is tics. Some are so mild they're not even noticeable. Others happen often and are obvious. Stress, excitement, or being sick or tired can make them worse. The more severe ones can be embarrassing and can affect your social life or work. There are two types of tics: Motor tics involve movement. They include: Arm or head jerking Blinking Making a face Mouth twitching Shoulder shrugging Vocal tics include: Barking or yelping Clearing your throat Coughing Grunting Repeating what someone else says Shouting Sniffing Swearing Tics can be simple or complex. A simple tic affects one or just a few parts of the body, like blinking the eyes or making a face. A complex one involves many parts of the body or saying words. Jumping and swearing are examples. Before a motor tic, you may get a sensation that can feel like a tingle or tension. The movement makes the sensation go away. You might be able to hold your tics back for a little while, but you probably can't stop them from happening. Doctors aren't sure why, but about half of people with Tourette's also have symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). You may have trouble paying attention, sitting still, and finishing tasks. Tourette's can also cause problems with: Anxiety Learning disabilities such as dyslexia Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) -- thoughts and behaviors you can't control, like washing your hands over and over again If you or your child has symptoms of Tourette's, your doctor may want you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the nervous system. There aren't any tests for the condition, but he'll ask you questions, like: What did you notice that brought you here today? Do you often move your body in a way you can't control? How long has that been happening? Do you ever say things or make sounds without meaning to? When did it start? Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse? Do you feel anxious or have trouble focusing? Does anyone else in your family have these kinds of symptoms? Your doctor may do imaging tests of your brain to rule out other conditions that have symptoms like those of Tourette's. They might include: MRI. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. CT scan. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed images of your insides. How long will these symptoms last? Will they ever go away? Do I need any more tests? What kind of specialists do I need to see? Do I need any treatment? Do the treatments have any side effects? If I have children, what are the chances they will have Tourette's? If your child has Tourette's, you may also want to ask how long his tics might last or what you can do to help him deal with his symptoms at home and at school. Many times, tics are mild and don't need to be treated. If they become a problem, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help them. It can take a while to find the right dose that helps control tics but avoids side effects, so be patient as you and your doctor work through it. Medications can include: Haloperidol ( Haldol), fluphenazine ( Prolixin), and pimozide ( Orap), which work on a brain chemical called dopamine to control tics. Clonidine ( Catapres) and guanfacine ( Tenex, Intuniv)), high blood pressure drugs that can also treat tics. Fluoxetine ( Prozac), paroxetine ( Paxil), sertraline ( Zoloft), and other antidepressants, which can relieve anxiety, sadness, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Along with medicine, you may want to consider talk therapy. A psychologist or counselor can help you learn how to deal with the social issues your tics and other symptoms may cause. Behavior therapy may also help. A specific kind, called habit-reversal training, teaches you how to recognize that a tic is coming and then move in a way that stops it. Often the hardest part of living with Tourette's is dealing with the embarrassment or frustration of having tics you can't control. While you're getting help from your doctor, you can do a few other things to feel better: Get support. Your family, friends, health care team, or a support group can help you meet the challenges of Tourette's. Stay active. Play sports, paint, or volunteer. These activities will take your mind off your symptoms. Relax. Read a book, listen to music, meditate, or do yoga. Low-key activities you enjoy can combat the stress that can lead to tics. Educate yourself. Learn everything you can about your condition so you'll know what to do when you have symptoms. If your child has Tourette's, talk to his school about it. You can give staff the facts about the condition and see what kind of support they can give him, like extra tutoring or smaller classes. Fitting in socially also can be hard for a child with the disease. Help him practice ways to handle teasing or comments from other kids. In most cases, kids grow out of their tics by their late teens or early 20s. A few will have them for the rest of their lives, but their symptoms may get better as they get older.

384,"Plant foods contain thousands of natural chemicals. These are called phytonutrients or phytochemicals."" Phyto"" refers to the Greek word for plant. These chemicals help protect plants from germs, fungi, bugs, and other threats. Fruits and vegetables contain phytonutrients. Other plant-based foods also contain phytonutrients, such as: Whole grains Nuts Beans Tea Phytonutrients aren't essential for keeping you alive, unlike the vitamins and minerals that plant foods contain. But when you eat or drink phytonutrients, they may help prevent disease and keep your body working properly. More than 25,000 phytonutrients are found in plant foods. Web MD takes a look at these six important phytonutrients -- and their potential health effects: Carotenoids Ellagic acid Flavonoids Resveratrol Glucosinolates Phytoestrogens More than 600 carotenoids provide yellow, orange, and red colors in fruits and vegetables. Carotenoids act as antioxidants in your body. This means they tackle harmful free radicals that damage tissues throughout your body. The types of carotenoids that may have other health benefits include: Alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. Your body can convert all of these to vitamin A. This vitamin helps keep your immune system working properly, and it's needed for eye health. Yellow and orange foods like pumpkins and carrots are good sources of alpha- and beta-carotene. These also contain beta-cryptoxanthin, as do sweet red peppers. Lycopene. This gives red or pink color to: Tomatoes Watermelon Pink grapefruit Lycopene has been linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer. Lutein and zeaxanthin. These may help protect you from cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, which are two types of eye problems. Good sources of these phytonutrients are greens such as: Spinach Kale Collards Ellagic acid is found in a number of berries and other plant foods, especially: Strawberries Raspberries Pomegranates Ellagic acid may help protect against cancer several different ways. For example, it may slow the growth of cancer cells. And it may help your liver neutralize cancer-causing chemicals in your system. But studies of this acid have mainly been done in the laboratory, so its benefits for human health is an unknown. A large number of phytonutrients fall into the flavonoid category. They are found in a variety of plant foods. The types of flavonoids include: Catechins. Green tea is an especially good source of catechins. The drink may help prevent certain types of cancer. Hesperidin. Found in citrus fruits, this flavonoid works as an antioxidant reducing inflammation in the body to help prevent chronic disease. Flavonols. Quercetin is a well-studied type of flavonol. It is found in: Apples Berries Kale Onions It might help reduce people's risk of asthma, certain types of cancer, and coronary heart disease. Resveratrol is found in: Grapes Purple grape juice Red wine It acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Some research suggests that resveratrol might play a role in reducing the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. And it may help extend life, animal studies have shown. But more human studies are needed to establish a clear relationship. Glucosinolates are found in cruciferous vegetables, including: Brussels sprouts Cabbage Kale Broccoli They give these vegetables their sharp odor and flavor. The glucosinolates turn into other chemicals during the cooking process and while you digest these foods. These chemicals may help hold in check the development and growth of cancer. Because of their structure, phytoestrogens can exert estrogen-like effects. They can also block the effects of your natural supply of estrogen. Soy foods contain isoflavones -- a type of phytoestrogen. Some evidence suggests that soy foods may be linked to: Lower risk of endometrial cancer Lower risk of bone loss in women Your body converts lignans, another type of phytonutrient, into chemicals with some estrogen-like effects. Two especially good sources of lignans are: Flaxseeds Sesame seeds However, research supporting a role for lignans in preventing endometrial cancer or osteoporosis is limited."
385,"In Peyronie's disease, scar tissue makes the penis bend or curve during an erection. When a guy gets an erection, chambers on the side of the penis fill with blood. There's a stretchy sheath that covers the chambers so it can grow. But with Peyronie's, scar tissue (also called plaque) on the sheath keeps your penis from standing straight. The scar tissue can stop a chamber from fully filling up, which forces the penis to bend. If the scar forms on the top of the penis -- which is what usually happens -- the penis curves up. If it forms on the bottom of the penis, it curves down. Scar tissue can also form on both the top and bottom, making the penis shorter and dented. No one knows for sure what causes Peyronie's disease. Many doctors think the scarring might be caused by a minor injury to the penis during sex -- from accidental bending, for example. But lots of men with the condition don't remember that type of injury. Older men, whose erections tend to bend more easily, are more likely to get Peyronie's than younger men. Genetics may also play a part. Men who have Peyronie's disease are more likely to also have Dupuytren's contracture. That's where tissue in the hand becomes scarred and thickened. It can force fingers to curl in toward your palm. You may notice a hard lump just below the skin of your penis right around where the curve starts. Sometimes, though, the scar tissue is too deep to feel. Scar tissue can vary in size from small to large and aren't always in just one spot. Sometimes the scar tissue goes around the penis, causing it to shorten. That can cause problems with erections, but no curving. In addition to a curve, other symptoms may include a lack of firmness, which may make it hard to keep an erection. Your doctor may suggest treatment for a curve of 30 degrees or more, especially if you have problems having sex. Even before you notice a curve, you may have painful erections. The pain comes from inflammation caused by the injury and can lasts for many months. The pain usually eases once the injury heals and the scar tissue hardens. Doctors typically diagnose Peyronie's disease by asking about symptoms and any injuries, and by examining the penis. Some doctors inject drugs into the penis to cause an erection so they can see the angle. If you bring in a photo of your erection, you can probably skip this. Your doctor may also order an ultrasound test of the area. There are ways to treat Peyronie's. If you see a family doctor or internist for the problem, he or she may refer you to a urologist for treatment."
386,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a rare condition. With it, you can have times of intense nausea, throwing up and other stomach problems for no apparent reason. These bouts can happen months apart, but sometimes they're serious enough that you'll need to go to the hospital. Though doctors have known about cyclic vomiting syndrome since the late 1800s, they don't know the cause. However, people who get migraine headaches, have diabetes or have problems with anxiety or depression sometimes have the syndrome as well. It's slightly more common in girls than boys, and is seen more in whites than in African- Americans or Latinos. And while the exact cause hasn't been found, several things might set off the vomiting, including: Physical or emotional stress Motion sickness Infections of the sinuses, throat or lungs Some foods Menstrual periods Hot weather Marijuana use has been linked to the syndrome, but some people say the drug eases the nausea they get. If you are throwing up like this, talk to your doctor. And be honest if you use pot. The main issue is intense nausea, which may come with strong stomach pains. It often sets in early in the morning and can last for several days. A typical bout may unfold like this: You might start to feel thirsty and sweaty and look pale. Your mouth might start watering, and you find yourself spitting. You might feel dizzy or want to avoid light. Once vomiting starts, it might happen as much as several times an hour. You might also have diarrhea, a headache or a mild fever. Doctors don't see it much. Cyclic vomiting syndrome happens more in children than adults. Only about 1.9% of children get it, one study found. The numbers for adults are less clear, though it may be more often than once thought. Even though it's rare, call your doctor if you are having symptoms. Doctors often figure out whether you have the condition by ruling out other possible causes, such as food poisoning, the flu or problems with your digestive system. Your doctor will do a physical exam, ask about earlier episodes and look at your family and medical history. He might give you blood or urine tests, X-rays or use other instruments to look for stomach, intestine or kidney problems. You might be sent to a gastroenterologist, a doctor who treats problems with the digestive system. Your doctor might recommend medication you can take to keep it from getting worse. Anti-nausea drugs might keep you from vomiting. You may take antacids to cut the amount of acid in your stomach or take other medicines to stop a migraine or lower your anxiety. And you'll probably be told to stay in bed in a quiet, dark room. Dehydration is the biggest complication. If a bout is bad enough, you might have to go to a hospital to replace the fluids and electrolytes you lost through vomiting. You might also need other drugs to ease your symptoms. Other complications might include: Esophagitis, which means the tube that goes from your throat to your stomach gets irritated by the acid you throw up. Stomach acid can also damage the enamel on your teeth or cause tooth decay. Severe vomiting might cause a tear in the lower end of the esophagus. See a doctor right away if you see blood in your vomit or your stools when you go to the bathroom. Try to figure out what things seem to set off vomiting in your or your child, and then avoid those as much as possible. It might be certain foods. Or it could be stressful situations. Children who have the syndrome sometimes grow out of it, but many of them get migraines as adults. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan to manage the condition and refer you to a gastroenterologist. The nonprofit Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association can help you find a doctor familiar with the problem, and it encourages people to join studies in search of causes and cures."
387,"Almost everybody gets a headache once in a while. For some, though, headaches are an inconvenient -- sometimes debilitating -- part of their lives. If you get regular headaches, it's important to work with your doctor to uncover the cause and find out how to treat it. That's not always easy because headaches can be caused by many things, from eating ice cream too quickly, to stroke, to many other serious conditions. Two types of headaches are caused by a change of pressure inside your skull: Low-pressure headaches (your doctor may call them spontaneous intracranial hypotension, or SIH) and high-pressure headaches (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or IIH). A low-pressure headache often gets worse when you stand or sit. It can get better if you lie down. It can start at the back of the head, sometimes with neck pain, though it can be felt all over your head. It often gets worse with coughing, sneezing, and exertion. It can come with: Ringing in your ears Muffled hearing Dizziness Nausea You might feel a stabbing pain, throbbing, or just overall pressure in your head. SIH is rare and can affect anyone of any age. Causes: SIH happens because of a leak of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF), although the leak is usually in your spine, not your skull. CSF is the âcushioningâ fluid that protects your brain and your spine. Diagnosis: After an exam, your doctor may do MRI and CT scans to figure out what's going on. They may also measure your CSF pressure by putting a needle in your back near your spine. Some experts say that might not help low-pressure headaches that much. Treatment: Your symptoms may go away by themselves. Sometimes, rest, drinking lots of water, and caffeine may help. A common treatment is something called an epidural blood patch, which tries to stop your CSF leak. Blood is taken from your arm and injected into an area of your spinal canal to âpatchâ the leak. This may not work the first time -- the actual spot where the CSF leaks is hard to find -- so you may have to go through the procedure several times. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called theophylline. The symptoms of a high-pressure headache often mimic those of a brain tumor, which is why IIH used to be called âpseudotumor cerebri,â or âfalse brain tumor.â Those symptoms include: Migraine-like or throbbing pain that's often worse in the morning Neck and shoulder pain Headaches that get worse with coughing, sneezing, or exertion Severe headaches that last for a long time Changes in vision or a ringing in the ears IIH is rare. Only about 100,000 Americans have it. Most of them are obese women of childbearing age. Causes: IIH is caused by higher pressure in the skull from too much CSF. Obesity is the main reason, though some medications -- including tetracycline, steroids, growth hormone, even too much vitamin A -- can cause it. Diagnosis: After going over your medical history, your doctor will probably ask for MRI and CT scans to help figure things out. You may have several different kinds of vision tests, too. IIH almost always puts pressure on the optic nerve. This leads to swelling called papilledema. That swelling can greatly affect your vision. It can lead to blindness if it's not caught in time. Your doctor will give you a spinal tap (they may call it lumbar puncture) to test your CSF pressure. A needle is inserted between two vertebrae in your lower back, and a special tube called a manometer measures the pressure. Treatment: The best way to ease the effects of IIH is to lose weight. That lowers the pressure on your brain and your optic nerve. You may need weight loss surgery if you're severely obese. Studies show that even modest weight loss of 5%-10% -- done through healthy eating, exercise, and cutting back on salt -- can ease symptoms. During treatment, regular and complete vision testing should be done, too, to keep an eye on pressure on your optic nerve. In some cases, a medication called acetazolamide is used to cut back on your body's production of CSF. In severe cases, you may need surgery to ease the pressure on your brain. Eye surgery is another possibility."
388,"Heat rash, also called prickly heat or miliaria, is a common condition in which areas of the skin feel prickly or sting due to overheating. It can itch a lot, but it's not dangerous. It looks like tiny bumps surrounded by red skin. It usually happens on clothed parts of the body, such as your back, abdomen, neck, upper chest, groin, or armpits. And it usually gets better once your skin cools off. Heat rash happens most often in hot, humid conditions. It's most common in infants. Active people, newborns in incubators, and people on bed rest with fever also are more likely to get it. You can get a heat rash when you sweat too much. The ducts from the sweat glands in your skin become blocked. This causes the sweat to leak into the surrounding tissue, which leads to irritation and redness. You may feel the prickly, or stinging, sensation that gives this condition its name. Move to a cooler, less humid place. Don't scratch your skin, or it could become infected. Keep the affected area dry. Don't use ointments or creams that keep your skin moist. You can put powder on the rash to feel more comfortable. Use a fan. Wear clothes that aren't tight and don't trap heat and moisture."
389,"There are many drugs prescribed for heart disease. It's important for people with heart disease and those who care for them to understand the meds, follow the labels, and recognize possible side effects. The ones most people with heart disease are given by their doctor include: ACE inhibitors: These widen arteries to lower your blood pressure and make it easier for your heart to pump blood. They also block some of the unpleasant things that can happen with heart failure. Aldosterone inhibitors: Eplerenone ( Inspra) and spironolactone ( Aldactone) are part of a class of medicine called potassium-sparing diuretics. They can ease the swelling and water buildup heart disease can cause. They help the kidneys send unneeded water and salt from your tissues and blood into your urine to be released. These drugs may help some symptoms, even while you take other treatments. They protect your heart by blocking a chemical in your body called aldosterone that causes salt and fluid buildup. This medicine is for folks with some types of severe heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs): These are used to lower blood pressure for people with heart failure. They help keep your blood vessels as wide as possible so blood can flow through your body more easily. They also lessen salt and fluid buildup in your body. Beta-blockers: They block the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine). This helps your heart work better. These meds also drop production of harmful substances your body makes in response to heart failure. And they cause your heart to beat slower and with less force. Those both lower your blood pressure. Calcium channel blockers: These treat chest pain (your doctor may say âanginaâ) and high blood pressure. They relax blood vessels and increase blood and oxygen to your heart. That eases its workload. They treat heart failure caused by hypertension. But they're used only when other medicines to lower blood pressure don't work. Ask your doctor if one is right for you. Cholesterol-lowering drugs: Cholesterol helps your body build new cells, insulate nerves, and make hormones. But inflammation may force cholesterol to build up in the walls of your arteries. That buildup increases your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Some people's genetics make it more likely that they'll have high cholesterol. These folks may need drug therapy, like statins, in addition to a healthier diet, to lower the chance that they'll get hardening of the arteries (also called atherosclerosis). Digoxin: It helps an injured or weakened heart to send blood through the body and work more efficiently. It strengthens the force of the heart muscle's contractions. It may improve blood circulation. You may be prescribed this if you have an irregular heartbeat (your doctor may call this atrial fibrillation, or AFib). It may help slow down your heart rate. Diuretics: You may know these as water pills. They help your kidneys get rid of unneeded water and salt from your tissues and bloodstream. That makes it easier for your heart to pump. They treat high blood pressure and ease swelling and water buildup caused by some medical problems, including heart failure. They also help make breathing easier. Inotropic therapy: This helps make an injured or weakened heart pump harder to send blood through the body. It helps strengthen the heart muscle's contractions. It also relaxes constricted blood vessels so blood can flow more smoothly. Inotropic therapy may also speed up your heart's rhythm. You may get this if you have end-stage heart failure to help relieve and control your symptoms. These medicines are used only when others have stopped working on symptoms. Potassium or magnesium: You can lose these electrolytes when you pee more while you take diuretics. That loss can cause abnormal heart rhythms. Ask your doctor if you should take supplements to make up the difference. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 ( PCSK9) inhibitors: You may get this new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs if diet and statin treatments aren't helping. They block a liver protein called PCSK9. That protein hinders your liver's ability to get rid of LDL (bad) cholesterol. Vasodilators: These relax your blood vessels so blood can flow more easily through your body. You'll get these if you can't take ACE inhibitors. Warfarin: This helps prevent clots from forming in your blood. You'll get it if your body is making blood clots, or if you have a condition that helps cause them. This medicine won't dissolve a blood clot. Over time, the clot may dissolve on its own. Warfarin may also prevent others from forming. Be sure to talk with your doctor if you have questions about any drugs you're taking."
390,"For teens and tweens with ADHD, simple tasks like cleaning their room or doing homework can seem to take forever, to you and them. And trying to enforce these tasks may often lead to arguments and frustration. By teaching time management, you can make these daily responsibilities more manageable and lessen the stress for everyone. These life skills will also allow your child to become more independent. He'll gain confidence in knowing he can take care of himself. Routines give the day structure, which is helpful for kids with ADHD. An unplanned day can seem overwhelming to a child with ADHD. There are ways to make things more manageable for you and your teen or tween. Sit down with your child and make a list of all of his daily responsibilities. Together, break down big activities into smaller steps, and decide how long he needs for each task. Don't make the schedule just about tasks. Schedule breaks and other activities your child wants to do. As much as possible, schedule activities for the same times every day, so they're easier for your teen to remember. If you know your mornings are rushed, why not plan for him to pick out clothes or put homework in his backpack the night before, when the pace is a bit slower? Put the list where you both can see it. Have your child cross off each item when finished. Kids get a sense of accomplishment from knowing they've completed tasks. It may be scheduled homework time, but when you check in, you find your child still sharpening pencils a half-hour later. It's common for kids with ADHD to put off doing things. Stick to the start and end times you agreed on for each task. Set a timer for each activity, and make his goal to finish tasks before the timer dings. Make sure to reward success. An incentive-based program with rewards for positive behavior is the best approach, but there need to be consequences for missing the mark. For example, you could: Tell your child: "" The kitchen is open at 7:30 a.m. At 7:50 a.m., it closes."" Set an alarm to go off at 7:30 a.m. when breakfast starts. Establish a rule that if your child isn't in the kitchen by 7:50, he or she doesn't get breakfast. Enforce the rule. It won't help if you don't stick with it. Your child shouldn't just rely on you to keep him on schedule. Have him set an alarm clock to get himself up in the morning. To keep aware of time, you may want to get him a watch. Clear the clutter off your teen's workspace so there's room to organize homework and space to study. It's hard for kids to get anything done when their desk is covered in a messy pile of papers. Have organizers and storage bins handy to keep papers, pencils, and other desk accessories in their proper places. Once you show your child how to organize things, tell him you expect him to keep it organized. Schedule time to put things away. Not just in the work space, but in his room as well. You will have good days and bad days. Your child's time management skills won't improve overnight. But if you stick with these steps and stay consistent, your tween or teen will get better at staying on task."
391,"A dental crown is a tooth-shaped ""cap"" that is placed over a tooth -- to cover the tooth to restore its shape and size, strength, and improve its appearance. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; Dr. Dina J. Giesler, DDS DINA GIESLER: The best way to describe a crown is it's a cap that we put on a tooth, and it's probably the best procedure we have to save a tooth. A patient needs a crown when the tooth has been compromised with, you know obviously, a big cavity or a root canal or a large filling that takes up more than 3/4 the size of a tooth. If you were to take out an old filling, usually there's just a shell left. So that's a very weak substructure, so a crown is actually something that covers and protects the tooth. if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The crowns, when cemented into place, fully encase the entire visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. A dental crown may be needed in the following situations: To protect a weak tooth (for instance, from decay) from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth To restore an already broken tooth or a tooth that has been severely worn down To cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there isn't a lot of tooth left To hold a dental bridge in place To cover misshapened or severely discolored teeth To cover a dental implant To make a cosmetic modification For children, a crown may be used on primary (baby) teeth in order to: Save a tooth that has been so damaged by decay that it can't support a filling. Protect the teeth of a child at high risk for tooth decay, especially when a child has difficulty keeping up with daily oral hygiene. Decrease the frequency of general anesthesia for children unable because of age, behavior, or medical history to fully cooperate with the requirements of proper dental care. In such cases, a pediatric dentist is likely to recommend a stainless steel crown. Permanent crowns can be made from stainless steel, all metal (such as gold or another alloy), porcelain-fused-to-metal, all resin, or all ceramic. Stainless steel crowns are prefabricated crowns that are used on permanent teeth primarily as a temporary measure. The crown protects the tooth or filling while a permanent crown is made from another material. For children, a stainless steel crown is commonly used to fit over a primary tooth that's been prepared to fit it. The crown covers the entire tooth and protects it from further decay. When the primary tooth comes out to make room for the permanent tooth, the crown comes out naturally with it. In general, stainless steel crowns are used for children's teeth because they don't require multiple dental visits to put in place and so are more cost- effective than custom-made crowns and prophylactic dental care needed to protect a tooth without a crown. Metals used in crowns include alloys that have a high content of gold or platinum, or base-metal alloys (for example, cobalt- chromium and nickel-chromium alloys). Metal crowns withstand biting and chewing forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. Also, metal crowns rarely chip or break. The metallic color -- and the high price of gold -- is the main drawback. Metal crowns are a good choice for out-of-sight molars. Porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns can be color matched to your adjacent teeth (unlike the metallic crowns). However, more wearing to the opposing teeth occurs with this crown type compared with metal or resin crowns. The crown's porcelain portion can also chip or break off. Next to all-ceramic crowns, porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns look most like normal teeth. However, sometimes the metal underlying the crown's porcelain can show through as a dark line, especially at the gum line and even more so if your gums recede. These crowns can be a good choice for front or back teeth as well as long bridges where the metal is needed for strength. All-resin dental crowns are less expensive than other crown types. However, they wear down over time and are more prone to fractures than porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns. All-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns provide better natural color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for people with metal allergies. All-ceramic crowns can be used for front and back teeth. Temporary versus permanent. Temporary crowns can be made in your dentist's office, whereas most permanent crowns are typically made in a dental laboratory. Typically, temporary crowns are made of an acrylic-based material or stainless steel and can be used as a temporary restoration until a permanent crown is constructed by a lab. Preparing a tooth for a crown usually requires two visits to the dentist -- the first step involves examining and preparing the tooth, the second visit involves placement of the permanent crown. First visit: Examining and preparing the tooth At the first visit in preparation for a crown, your dentist may take a few X-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone. If the tooth has extensive decay or if there is a risk of infection or injury to the tooth's pulp, a root canal treatment may first be performed. Before the process of making a crown begins, your dentist will anesthetize (numb) the tooth and the gum tissue around the tooth. Next, the tooth receiving the crown is reshaped along the chewing surface and sides to make room for the crown. The amount removed depends on the type of crown used. If, on the other hand, a large area of the tooth is missing (due to decay or damage), your dentist will use filling material to ""build up"" the tooth to support the crown. After reshaping the tooth, your dentist typically will use a paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. Sometimes, though, impressions are made with a digital scanner. Impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. The impressions or scans are sent to a dental lab where the crown will be manufactured. The crown is usually returned to your dentist's office in two to three weeks. If the crown is made of porcelain, your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. During this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. Temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement. Second visit: Receiving the permanent dental crown At the second visit, your dentist will remove the temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. If everything is acceptable, a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place. Because temporary dental crowns are just that -- a temporary fix until a permanent crown is ready -- most dentists suggest that a few precautions. These include: Avoid sticky, chewy foods (for example, chewing gum, caramel), which have the potential of grabbing and pulling off the crown. Minimize use of the side of your mouth with the temporary crown. Shift the bulk of your chewing to the other side of the mouth. Avoid chewing hard foods (such as raw vegetables), which could dislodge or break the crown. Slide rather than lift out dental floss when cleaning between your teeth to avoid pulling off the temporary crown. Discomfort or sensitivity. Your newly crowned tooth may be sensitive immediately after the procedure as the anesthesia begins to wear off. If the tooth that has been crowned still has a nerve in it, you may experience some heat and cold sensitivity. Your dentist may recommend that you brush teeth with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. Pain or sensitivity that occurs when you bite down usually means that the crown is too high on the tooth. If this is the case, call your dentist. He or she can easily fix the problem. Chipped crown. Crowns made of all porcelain or porcelain fused to metal can sometimes chip. If the chip is small, a composite resin can be used to repair the chip with the crown remaining in your mouth. This is usually just a temporary fix. If the chipping is extensive, the crown may need to be replaced. Loose crown. Sometimes the cement washes out from under the crown. Not only does this allow the crown to become loose, it allows bacteria to leak in and cause decay to the tooth that remains. If a crown feels loose, contact your dentist's office. Crown falls off. Sometimes crowns fall off. Reasons include decaying of the underlying tooth and loosening of the cementing material used to place the crown. If your crown comes off, clean the crown and the front of the tooth. You can replace the crown temporarily using dental adhesive or temporary tooth cement that is sold in stores for this purpose. Contact your dentist's office immediately. He or she will give you specific instructions on how to care for the tooth and crown for the day or so until you can be seen for an evaluation. Your dentist may be able to re-cement the crown in place; if not, a new crown will need to be made. Allergic reaction . Because the metals used to make crowns are usually a mixture of metals, an allergic reaction to the metals or porcelain used in crowns can occur, but this is extremely rare. Dark line on crowned tooth next to the gum line. A dark line next to the gum line of your crowned tooth is normal, particularly if you have a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown. This dark line is simply the metal of the crown showing through. While not a problem in itself, the dark line is cosmetically unacceptable and your dentist may have to replace the crown with an all porcelain or ceramic one. Onlays and 3/4 crowns are variations on the technique of dental crowns. The difference between these crowns and the crowns discussed previously is their coverage of the underlying tooth. The ""traditional"" crown covers the entire tooth; onlays and 3/4 crowns cover the underlying tooth to a lesser extent. On average, dental crowns last between five and 15 years. The life span of a crown depends on the amount of ""wear and tear"" the crown is exposed to, how well you follow good oral hygiene practices, and your personal mouth-related habits (you should avoid such habits as grinding or clenching your teeth, chewing ice, biting fingernails, and using your teeth to open packaging). While a crowned tooth does not require any special care, remember that simply because a tooth is crowned does not mean the tooth is protected from decay or gum disease. Therefore, continue to follow good oral hygiene practices, including brushing your teeth at least twice a day, flossing daily -- especially around the crown area where the gum meets the tooth -- and rinsing with an antibacterial mouthwash at least once a day. Costs of crowns vary depending on what part of the country you live in and on the type of crown selected (porcelain versus gold, for example). Generally, crowns can range in cost from $800 to $1700 or more per crown. A portion of the cost of a crown is generally covered by insurance. To be certain, check with your dental insurance company."
392,"The most important nutrients for people with osteoporosis are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium is a key building block for your bones. Vitamin D helps your body to absorb calcium. How much should you get? It depends, in part, on your age and gender. For calcium: Children ages 1-3 should get 700 milligrams of calcium a day. Children ages 4-8 should get 1,000 milligrams per day. Children over age 9 and teenagers should get 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day. Women over age 51 and men over age 71 should get 1,200 milligrams per day. All other adults should get 1,000 milligrams per day. For vitamin D: 600 international units ( IU) of vitamin D per day from age 1 through age 70 800 IU daily after age 70. Some osteoporosis experts recommend 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D per day. To find out how much vitamin D you personally need, consider a blood test for the vitamin (25-hydroxy vitamin D) from your doctor. It measures how much vitamin D is in your body. Experts think that vitamin D may do more to protect you from osteoporosis than only helping you absorb calcium. To strengthen bones and prevent osteoporosis, you can get calcium and vitamin D from your diet, supplements, or both. It's best to get these nutrients from food, rather than supplements. Why? Because it's easier to remember. You may not take a pill every day, but you eat every day. Foods also are a more complete source of nutrition than supplements. Milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products have high levels of calcium, and also other key nutrients for bone health, such as phosphorus and protein. When you read food labels, look for foods and drinks that give you 10% or more of the Daily Value for calcium. If you're lactose intolerant or avoid dairy for other reasons, there are lots of other options: Calcium-fortified orange juice, plant-based milks (like soy and almond milk), and cereals Green, leafy vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and spinach Seafood such as canned salmon, oysters, ocean perch, clams, blue crab, and shrimp For vitamin D, look for items that are fortified, such as some orange juices, breakfast cereals, and plant-based milks. Certain fish, such as salmon, tuna fish, and sardines, may also be a good source. If you can't get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet, talk to your doctor about whether you need supplements. Calcium supplements come in several types, including: Calcium citrate Calcium carbonate As far as your bones are concerned, it doesn't matter which type you take. The difference is in how you take them. You should take calcium carbonate supplements with meals, to help your body absorb the most calcium. If you take calcium citrate instead, you don't need to take them when you eat. With either type, your body can only absorb up to 500 milligrams at one time. So you may need to take supplements more than once a day. Most of these supplements also come in formulas that include a dose of vitamin D. If you get the combination form, you'll get both nutrients in one pill."
393,"As the number of candles on your birthday cake grows, you might notice that you wake up earlier or throughout the night. You may find that you get fewer hours of shut-eye, or you fall asleep during the day. Rest assured, there are things you can do to get the sleep you need. There's no ârightâ amount of sleep. What you consider a good amount can be entirely different than what your neighbor needs. Still, experts recommend adults get 7 to 9 hours every night. If you get fewer Zzz's than you did when you were younger, but you still feel rested and energetic, you might simply need less sleep than you used to. But if you feel rundown because of it, here are some ways to get better rest. Stick to a regular bedtime. Go to sleep and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends. Your body will get used to the routine. Take a warm bath. When you get out of the tub, the drop in body temperature may help you feel tired. It can also help you relax and slow down, so you're more ready to go to bed. Take time to calm down before you turn out the lights. Turn off your electronic devices and TV an hour before bed. You can read a book, listen to music -- whatever helps you unwind. Make the bedroom a sleep zone. If you're still awake 20 minutes after you hit the sack, get up. Get back in bed only when you feel tired enough. Train yourself to think of the bed as a place for sleeping only. Avoid afternoon naps. If you sleep during the day, you're more likely to stay awake at night. Don't drink alcohol close to bedtime. Even small amounts can make it harder to stay asleep. It can make you wake up in the middle of the night when the effects of the booze have worn off. Drink less fluids at night. Trips to the bathroom break up your sleep. Wear yourself out. Exercise at regular times each day, but not within 3 hours of your bedtime. Get some sun. Make an effort to get outside in the sunlight each day. It'll let your body know when it's time to be awake, and when it's not. But do wear sunscreen. If you still can't sleep, your doctor may be able to help. He can see if you might have a condition that's causing you to stay awake. He can also check any medications you're taking to see if they're interfering with your Zzz's. He can refer you to a sleep specialist, too. If you figure out what's keeping you up at night, you can tackle the issue and sleep better. Illnesses and conditions. You may have a medical condition that's affecting your rest. Ailments like arthritis, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome can all make sleep a challenge. Treatment to help your condition may help you get some shut-eye. Medications. Some can keep you awake at night. Make sure your doctor knows about all the medications you take. She may suggest you adjust when to take it or how much you take. She may even be able to change your medication to something that won't affect your slumber. Change. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some major transitions in your life. Things like illness, financial problems, or the death of a loved one cause stress, and that can make it hard to sleep. Talk to your family or meet with a counselor to find ways to manage your stress. Retirement. You might have a lot more downtime and be less active during the day. That can throw off your sleep-wake schedule. So try to keep your body and mind moving: You could volunteer, hit the gym, learn a new skill, spend time with friends and family -- the point is, stay active."
394,"To reduce the risk of getting infected with chlamydia, use a condom each time you have sex. Limit the number of sexual partners, or consider practicing abstinence. If you think you are infected, avoid sexual contact and see a doctor. If you test positive, your partner should also get treatment. Get retested after three months, even if both you and your partner appear infection free. Most doctors recommend that all people who have more than one sexual partner, especially women, be tested for chlamydia regularly even in the absence of symptoms. It is also recommended that all sexually active women under age 25 be tested yearly as well."
395,"The breast is composed of several glands and ducts that lead to the nipple and the surrounding colored area called the areola. The milk-carrying ducts extend from the nipple into the underlying breast tissue like the spokes of a wheel. Under the areola are lactiferous ducts. These fill with milk during lactation after a woman has a baby. When a girl reaches puberty, changing hormones cause the ducts to grow and cause fat deposits in the breast tissue to increase. The glands that produce milk (mammary glands) that are connected to the surface of the breast by the lactiferous ducts may extend to the armpit area. Mastitis is an infection of the tissue of the breast that occurs most frequently during the time of breastfeeding. It can occur when bacteria, often from the baby's mouth, enter a milk duct through a crack in the nipple. Breast infections most commonly occur one to three months after the delivery of a baby, but they can occur in women who have not recently delivered and in women after menopause. Other causes of infection include chronic mastitis and a rare form of cancer called inflammatory carcinoma. In healthy women, mastitis is rare. However, women with diabetes, chronic illness, AIDS, or an impaired immune system may be more susceptible. About 1%-3% of breastfeeding mothers develop mastitis. Engorgement and incomplete breast emptying can contribute to the problem and make the symptoms worse. Chronic mastitis occurs in women who are not breastfeeding. In postmenopausal women, breast infections may be associated with chronic inflammation of the ducts below the nipple. Hormonal changes in the body can cause the milk ducts to become clogged with dead skin cells and debris. These clogged ducts make the breast more open to bacterial infection. Infection tends to come back after treatment with antibiotics. Breast infections may cause pain, redness, and warmth of the breast along with the following symptoms: Tenderness and swelling Body aches Fatigue Breast engorgement Fever and chills Abscess: A breast abscess can be a complication of mastitis. Noncancerous masses such as abscesses are more often tender and frequently feel mobile beneath the skin. The edge of the mass is usually regular and well defined. Indications that this more serious infection has occurred include the following: Tender lump in the breast that does not get smaller after breastfeeding a newborn ( If the abscess is deep in the breast, you may not be able to feel it.) Pus draining from the nipple Persistent fever and no improvement of symptoms within 48-72 hours of treatment Call your health care provider as soon as you feel any suspicious lump, whether you are breastfeeding or not. Call for an appointment if: You have any abnormal discharge from your nipples. Breast pain is making it difficult for you to function each day. You have prolonged, unexplained breast pain. You have any other associated symptoms such as redness, swelling, pain that interferes with breastfeeding, a mass or tender lump in the breast that does not disappear after breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of breast infection so that treatment may be started promptly. You may need to be evaluated in a hospital's emergency department if the breast pain is associated with other signs of an infection (such as a fever, swelling, or redness to the breast) and if your health care provider cannot see you promptly. The below symptoms require emergency treatment: A persistent high fever greater than 101.5 ° F Nausea or vomiting that is preventing you from taking the antibiotics as prescribed Pus draining from the breast Red streaks extending toward your arm or chest Dizziness, fainting, or confusion The diagnosis of mastitis and a breast abscess can usually be made based on a physical exam. If it is unclear whether a mass is due to a fluid-filled abscess or to a solid mass such as a tumor, a test such as an ultrasound may be done. An ultrasound may also be helpful in distinguishing between simple mastitis and abscess or in diagnosing an abscess deep in the breast. This noninvasive test allows your doctor to directly visualize the abscess by placing an ultrasound probe over your breast. If an abscess is confirmed, aspiration or surgical drainage, and IV antibiotics, are often required. Cultures may be taken, either of breast milk or of material taken out of an abscess through a syringe, to determine the type of organism causing the infection. This information can help your doctor decide what kind of antibiotic to use. Nonbreastfeeding women with mastitis, or those who do not respond to treatment, may have a mammogram or breast biopsy. This is a precautionary measure because a rare type of breast cancer can produce symptoms of mastitis. Breast infections require treatment by a health care provider. After you see a doctor, try the following to help your breast infection heal. Pain medication: Take acetaminophen ( Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) for pain. These drugs are safe while breastfeeding and will not harm your baby. Your doctor may prescribe a prescription strength pain reliever if your pain is severe and not relieved with over-the-counter medication. In mild cases of mastitis, antibiotics may not be prescribed at all. If you are prescribed antibiotics, finishing the prescription even if you feel better in a few days is very important. Frequent feedings: Do not stop breastfeeding from the affected breast, even though it will be painful and you may be taking antibiotics. Frequent emptying of the breast prevents engorgement and clogged ducts that can only make mastitis worse. If needed, use a breast pump to relieve pressure and completely empty the breast. You can also breastfeed from the unaffected side and supplement with infant formula as needed. The infection will not harm the baby because the germs that caused the infection probably came from the baby's mouth in the first place. Breastfeeding should be avoided in the infected breast when an abscess is present. Pain relief: A warm compress applied before and after feedings can often provide some relief. A warm bath may work as well. If heat is ineffective, ice packs applied after feedings may provide some comfort and relief. Avoid using ice packs just before breastfeeding because it can slow down milk flow. Drink plenty of water -- at least 10 glasses a day. Eat well-balanced meals and add 500 extra calories a day while breastfeeding. Dehydration and poor nutrition can decrease milk supply and make you feel worse. For simple mastitis without an abscess, oral antibiotics are prescribed. Cephalexin ( Keflex) and dicloxacillin ( Dycill) are two of the most common antibiotics chosen, but a number of others are available. The antibiotic prescribed will depend on your specific situation, your doctor's preference, and any drug allergies you may have. This medicine is safe to use while breastfeeding and will not harm the baby. Chronic mastitis in nonbreastfeeding women can be complicated. Recurrent episodes of mastitis are common. Occasionally, this type of infection responds poorly to antibiotics. Therefore, close follow-up with your doctor is mandatory. If the infection worsens in spite of oral antibiotics or if you have a deep abscess requiring surgical treatment, you may be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. If an abscess is present, it must be drained. After injection of a local anesthetic, the doctor may drain an abscess near the surface of the skin either by aspiration with a needle and syringe or by using a small incision. This can be done in the doctor's office or emergency department. If the abscess is deep in the breast, however, it may require surgical drainage in the operating room. This procedure is usually done under general anesthesia to minimize pain and completely drain the abscess. Antibiotics and heat on the area are also used to treat abscesses. Mastitis does not cause cancer, but cancer can mimic mastitis in appearance. If a breast infection is slow to go away, your health care provider may recommend a mammogram or other tests to rule out cancer. If you have a breast infection, you may be seen for a recheck in 24-48 hours. Take all antibiotics as prescribed. Take your temperature three times a day for the first 48 hours after treatment begins. Watch for fever. Call your doctor if you develop a high fever, vomiting, or increasing redness, swelling, or pain in the breast. Follow up with your doctor in one to two weeks to make sure that the infection has gone away. If the infection spreads or an abscess develops, you may require IV antibiotics or surgical treatment. Sometimes mastitis is unavoidable. Some women are more susceptible than others, especially those who are breastfeeding for the first time. In general, good habits to prevent mastitis include the following: Breastfeed equally from both breasts. Empty breasts completely to prevent engorgement and blocked ducts. Use good breastfeeding techniques to prevent sore, cracked nipples. Allow sore or cracked nipples to air dry. Prevent moisture from accumulating in breast pads or bras. Avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Practice careful hygiene: Handwashing, cleaning the nipples, keeping your baby clean. When treated promptly, the majority of breast infections go away quickly and without serious complications. Most women can and should continue to breastfeed despite an episode of uncomplicated mastitis. With proper treatment, symptoms should begin to resolve within one to two days. A breast abscess may require surgical drainage, IV antibiotics, and a short hospital stay. A small incision is made and usually heals quite well. Prognosis for complete recovery is also good. Postmenopausal women with breast abscesses have a high rate of return after simple drainage and frequently need to follow up with a surgeon for more definitive treatment. Chronic infection can result if an abscess is not completely drained, and this can result in a poor cosmetic outcome."
396,"The first year of your new baby's life is an amazing time. Within just 12 months, your baby will transform from a newborn who is totally dependent on you to a toddler who is starting to walk, talk, and exhibit the first signs of independence. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } During the first month, your newborn is just getting used to this big, strange new world. And you are getting used to taking care of his many needs. Below are just a few of the changes you can expect to see during your child's first month. It's important to remember that infants who were born prematurely won't follow these baby milestones exactly. They will likely hit each milestone according to their due date, rather than on their birthday. Babies who were born a month early will probably take an extra month to catch up to their peers. Don't be alarmed if your baby loses some weight during the first few days of life. Babies are born with extra body fluid and typically lose up to 10% of their birth weight before they stabilize and start gaining. By their two-week birthday, babies should be back up to their birth weight, and during the first month they'll gain weight quickly -- putting on between a half-ounce and an ounce a day. Your doctor will check baby's weight gain against a growth chart during your well-baby visits, to make sure he is growing at the right rate. A newborn's nervous system is still maturing, but babies can accomplish a lot in their first month. You'll notice that your baby was born with several innate reflexes, including sucking. Soon after birth, he will be able to (with a little help from you) latch on to a breast or nipple to feed. If you put your finger inside baby's palm, you'll notice that he'll close his fist around it (and many a proud father has bragged about the strength of his newborn's grip). Babies who are startled will quickly flare both arms and legs out and then pull them in. This is called the Moro reflex. Even at 1 month old, your baby has the instinct for walking. If you put a newborn's feet on a solid surface while supporting their body, they'll appear to take a few steps. Although 1-month-olds may be able to turn their head while lying on their stomach, they don't yet have the neck strength to support their head while upright. Make sure to put a hand under your baby's head whenever you lift him. Being born is hard work. For the first few weeks, it seems that all your newborn will want to do is sleep. In fact, newborns sleep 15 to 16 hours a day. Those hours may be erratic, because baby hasn't yet adjusted to the normal day and night cycle. You can help your baby adjust by limiting activities to daytime, and keeping things quiet, dark, and boring at night. Eventually he will get the hint that day is for play and night is for sleep. Also, your 1-month-old's sleep cycles are much different than yours. Unlike adults, newborn babies spend more time in REM sleep than in deeper non- REM sleep. That means they may wake up fairly easily during those first few weeks. Babies are born with very fuzzy eyesight. Newborns are very nearsighted. Your baby can see objects and people most clearly when they are just 8 to 12 inches away. That means he can see your face while he is nursing, and in fact, will prefer looking at you than at a stuffed animal, because infants are naturally drawn to human faces. They also prefer high-contrast objects because they're easier to see (although you needn't outfit your entire nursery in black-and-white; bright colors are good, too). You may notice that your 1-month-old's eyes cross when trying to focus. That is normal, because a newborn's eye control hasn't fully developed. However, if they remain crossed at three or four months, call your pediatrician, because it could be a sign of strabismus (crossed eyes). Although a newborn's hearing isn't yet fully developed, babies can recognize sounds -- especially their parents' voices, which they got used to hearing in the womb. They especially like high-pitched sounds; so don't get too annoyed when your mother-in-law uses that squeaky baby voice every time she talks to your newborn. If baby doesn't seem to be responding at all to sound, be sure to mention this to your pediatrician at your well visits. Many states screen all babies' hearing at birth, but be sure to mention hearing concerns to your pediatrician even if the birth test was OK. Like many older children (and adults), babies prefer sweet tastes. Their taste buds aren't yet mature enough to distinguish bitter and sour. They have a well-developed sense of smell, and can already pick out the scent of their mother's nipple, and breast milk, within the first few days of life. During month one, expect your breastfed baby to eat eight to 12 times a day (about every two to three hours). Bottle-fed babies may only need to eat six to eight times. Some parents feed on demand, while others stick to a schedule. You'll know when your baby is hungry, because she'll start to root (move her head back and forth, searching for a breast) or get fussy and turn her mouth when you touch her cheek. A baby who has had enough to eat will seem satisfied, and may even fall asleep. Look for four to six wet diapers a day as a sign that your baby is eating enough. One-month-old babies pretty much have one mode of communication -- crying. Your baby will cry for up to three hours a day (don't panic, the crying will decrease as time passes). Crying is baby's way of saying, '' I'm hungry - feed me!'' '' I have a wet diaper,'' or, '' I'm really tired.'' Eventually, you'll start to translate these cries, and discover the best ways to soothe him (for example by rocking or swaddling your baby). Some babies who cry too much may have colic or a medical problem, so call your doctor if you just can't console your newborn. Babies love to be touched. Give your 1-month-old lots of skin-to-skin contact, for example by holding and rocking, or giving him a gentle massage. It will make your newborn feel comforted and loved. Move baby's legs in a bicycling motion for a couple of minutes at a time. This easy exercise will help tone the muscles to prepare for crawling and walking -- which your baby will start doing before you know it!"
397,"These itchy welts can show up anywhere on your skin. They're caused by an allergic or other type of reaction. Your doctor may call them urticaria. They can last a few minutes or several days before they go away. Sometimes they're a sign of more serious problems, especially when you have trouble breathing. Hives that recur or that last more than 6 weeks are considered chronic urticaria and require further evaluation. If you have hives along with fever, nausea, stomach cramps, shortness of breath, and a drop in blood pressure after a bee sting, insect bite, or drug injection, that can be a sign of a life-threatening allergy. If your doctor has prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector for you, make sure you have two with you at all times. Use one and then call 911 or go to the hospital. Another reaction that sometimes happens along with hives is called angioedema. It's swelling that develops under the skin. It often affects the eyes and lips, and sometimes the genitals, hands, and feet. It's rare, but the swelling from angioedema can happen in your throat and cause trouble breathing. If that happens, use an auto-injector and call 911. They pop up when skin cells release a substance called histamine. It's the start of the process we call an allergic reaction. Common triggers for hives include: Foods like milk, fish, or nuts Drugs like aspirin or penicillin Food additives like flavorings and preservatives Bug bites Extreme cold or heat Pressure on the skin Viral infections Skin contact with allergens There's one surefire way: Figure out what's causing them and stay away from it. You can take antihistamines to ease your symptoms. If over-the-counter medicine doesn't help or your hives won't go away, see your doctor. She may prescribe steroid pills or prescription antihistamines. At home, try these tips: Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the hives. Try to work and sleep in a cool room. Wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothes."
398,"If you want to craft a battle plan to prevent colds, you don't have to think long and hard about it. Just remember three simple words: Wash your hands! There's no secret in why that works. It's all due to the way colds spread. The main way colds get passed around is when someone who's sick coughs or sneezes. Little droplets with germs land on places like doorknobs, telephones, and computer keyboards. Or the sick person coughs or sneezes into their hands and then touches those objects. Then you come along, happy and healthy, and touch that spot. Next, without even realizing it, you might touch your nose and mouth. Voila! In an instant you're infected. Some viruses -- tiny living things that cause colds -- can live on surfaces for hours. Regular hand washing is your best strategy to keep them from getting inside your body. And of course, if you're the one who's sick, washing up will keep you from spreading your germs. There's some evidence behind this. A program called Operation Stop Cough was started at a military recruit training command center in Illinois. As part of the program, recruits were told to wash their hands at least five times a day. After 2 years, the hand-washing team reported 45% fewer cases of respiratory illness, compared with sickness rates among recruits during the year before the program started. Many of us get so busy, we simply forget to wash our hands the right way. Here's the drill: First, wet your hands with water. Then add soap. Rub them together vigorously for 20 seconds. Make sure to rub the wrists, between the fingers, and under the fingernails. When you have time, use a nailbrush, as germs often hide under nails. Rinse your hands thoroughly and dry with a clean paper towel or air dryer. If you are in a public restroom, shut the faucet off with a paper towel. Try to push the door open with your shoulder, or use another paper towel to turn the knob. You should wash hands often throughout the day. For example, do it before and after you eat, after using the bathroom, after school, and after handling any raw meat, unwashed vegetables, or garbage. Also wash your hands after coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, or touching your pet. If you're babysitting, wash before and after changing a baby's diapers and before and after feedings. Keep an alcohol-based sanitizer for hands if a sink is unavailable. It should be at least 60% alcohol. Rub the entire surface of your hands, fingers, and wrist with the sanitizer until dry. You can use this throughout the day if you're not near a bathroom. Follow up with a thorough hand scrub when you're near a sink to prevent buildup of the sanitizer."
399,"If you feel pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The chest pain happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's occurs when something blocks the arteries or there's a decreased blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have it. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack. There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control it. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need what's called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries. There are different types of angina: Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you. Unstable angina. You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away. Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated. Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel: Aching Burning Discomfort Feeling of fullness in the chest Heaviness Pressure Squeezing You're likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas. Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness. One study found that women were more likely to use the words ""pressing"" or ""crushing"" to describe the feeling. Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse. Angina is usually due to heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. That causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks. Other, less common causes of chest pain include: A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism) An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) Narrowing of a valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis) Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis) Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection) Do I need any more tests? What type of angina do I have? Do I have heart damage? What treatment do you recommend? How will it make me feel? What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack? Are there activities I shouldn't do? Will changing my diet help? It depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help blood flow better and control symptoms. Your doctor might prescribe medicines to: Widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to the heart Slow the heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard Relax blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart Prevent blood clots If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be: Angioplasty /stenting: The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, he inflates the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. A small tube called a stent may be left inside the artery to help keep it open. The stent is usually permanent and made of metal. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You'll probably stay overnight at the hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG), or bypass surgery. The surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels. You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover. You can still lead an active life, but it's important that you listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what you're doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often. It's important to talk to your doctor to have your medications changed or to be evaluated for further testing or procedures if you are feeling pain. Because angina can be an ominous sign, it is important to get fully evaluated. These lifestyle changes may help protect your heart: Stop smoking . It can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk. Eat a heart-healthy diet to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar. Also: Use stress-relieving measures like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax. Exercise most days of the week. See your doctor regularly. If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you, and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Don't wait. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage. Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But it's treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make smart choices. Talk with others who have it. That may help you learn how to feel better. Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina. They'll want to know what they can do to help."
400,"When you have a long-term illness like multiple sclerosis, you may have moments when you get stressed out. There are many ways to keep those feelings under control, including relaxation methods and exercise. To help manage your emotions, it helps to learn the warning signs that you are under too much stress. Your body sends out physical, emotional, and behavioral warning signs of stress: Some of the emotional signals you may notice are that you: Get angry Find it hard to concentrate Feel worried Become sad Have frequent mood swings Physical warning signs include: Stooped posture Sweaty palms Fatigue Weight gain or loss You'll know you're starting to show behavioral warning signs when you: Overreact Act on impulse Use alcohol or drugs Withdraw from your relationships Part of your strategy to cut stress is to keep a positive attitude and accept that there are some events that you can't control. Also try to follow these tips: Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, combative, or passive. Learn relaxation techniques. Exercise regularly. Eat well-balanced meals. Get enough sleep and rest. Don't rely on alcohol or drugs to end stress. A number of methods can calm things down. Exercises include breathing, muscle and mind relaxation, and relaxation to music. Whichever you try, first make sure you have a: Quiet location that's free of distractions Comfortable body position (sit or recline on a chair or sofa) Good state of mind (try to block out worries and distracting thoughts) Then try one of these techniques: Two-minute relaxation. Switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. Take a few deep breaths, then breathe out slowly. Mentally scan your body. Notice areas that feel tense or cramped and then loosen them up. Let go of as much tension as you can. Rotate your head in a smooth, circular motion once or twice. ( Stop if you feel pain.) Roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. Let all your muscles completely relax. Recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. Take another deep breath and then breathe out slowly. Mind relaxation. Close your eyes. Breathe normally through your nose. As you breathe out, silently say to yourself the word ""one,"" a short word such as ""peaceful,"" or a short phrase such as "" I feel quiet."" Continue for 10 minutes. If your mind wanders, gently remind yourself to think about your breathing and your chosen word or phrase. Let your breathing become slow and steady. Deep-breathing relaxation. Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot and fill your belly with air. Let the air fill you from the belly up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. With every long, slow breath out, you should feel more relaxed."
401,"Sometimes, there are no symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease. If symptoms are present, they may include one or more of the following: Bumps, sores, or warts near the mouth, anus, penis, or vagina Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina Skin rash Painful urination Weight loss, loose stools, or night sweats Aches, pains, fever, and chills Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor.)

402,"Anyone can get colorectal cancer, and doctors often don't know why someone gets it. Although scientists don't know the exact cause, they do know some of the things that make people more likely to get it. These include: Age. The disease is most common in people over age 50, and the chance of getting colorectal cancer increases with each decade. But younger people can get it, too. Gender. Colorectal cancer is more common among men. Men and women are equally at risk for colon cancer, but men are more likely to develop rectal cancer. Polyps. These growths on the inner wall of the colon or rectum aren't cancer, but they can be precancerous. They're fairly common in people over age 50. One type of polyp, called an adenoma, makes colorectal cancer more likely. Adenomas are the first step toward colon and rectal cancer. Personal history. If you've already had colorectal cancer, you could get it again, especially if you had it for the first time before age 60. Also, people who have chronic inflammatory conditions of the colon, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, are more likely to develop colorectal cancer than other people. Family history. Do you have a parent, brother, sister, or child who has had colorectal cancer? That makes you more likely to get it, too. If that relative was diagnosed when he or she was younger than 45 years old, your risk is even higher. If conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis, MYH-associated polyposis, or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer run in your family, that raises the risk for colon cancer (and other cancers), too. Diet. People who eat a lot of fat and cholesterol and little fiber may be more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Lifestyle. You may be more likely to get colorectal cancer if you drink a lot of alcohol, smoke, don't get enough exercise, and if you are overweight. Diabetes. People with diabetes are more likely to develop colorectal cancer than other people. Race. African- Americans are more likely than other U. S. racial and ethnic groups to get colorectal cancer. Doctors don't know why that is. If you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you will develop colorectal cancer. But you should talk about your risk factors with your doctor. She may be able to suggest ways to lower your chances and tell you when you need to get checked."
403,"For years, herbalists have touted bee pollen as an exceptionally nutritious food. They've even claimed it is a cure for certain health problems. Yet after years of research, scientists still cannot confirm that bee pollen has any health benefits. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Bee pollen contains vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, lipids, and protein. It comes from the pollen that collects on the bodies of bees. Bee pollen may also include bee saliva. It's important to avoid confusing bee pollen with natural honey, honeycomb, bee venom, or royal jelly. These products do not contain bee pollen although there are combination products that contain one or more of these substances. Bee pollen is available at many health food stores. You may find bee pollen in other natural dietary supplements, as well as in skin softening products used for baby's diaper rash or eczema. You may also hear recommendations for using bee pollen for alcoholism, asthma, allergies, health maintenance, or stomach problems, but there is no proof that it helps with these conditions. Before you take any natural product for a health condition, check with your doctor. Bee pollen is also recommended by some herbalists to enhance athletic performance, reduce side effects of chemotherapy, and improve allergies and asthma. At this point, medical research has not shown that bee pollen is effective for any of these health concerns. Bee pollen appears to be safe for most people, at least when taken for a short term. But if you have pollen allergies, you may get more than you bargained for. Bee pollen can cause a serious allergic reaction -- including shortness of breath, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis. Bee pollen is not safe for pregnant women. A woman should also avoid using bee pollen if she is breastfeeding. Bee pollen may cause increased bleeding if taken with certain blood thinners like warfarin. Check with your doctor before taking bee pollen if you take any medications, over-the-counter medicines, or herbals."
404,"If your allergies flare up in the late summer or early fall, you're probably allergic to ragweed. It's the most common trigger for hay fever. About 1 out of 5 people get a reaction to it. Ragweed causes symptoms like stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. It can also trigger asthma flares. People who have ragweed allergies are reacting to its pollen. During ragweed season, one plant can release a billion grains of it into the air. Ragweed is worse when nights are cool and days are warm and dry. Its season usually starts in early August and ends in mid- October. Some researchers think climate change may be extending that season. Everywhere in the U. S. has ragweed. It's most common in the East and Midwest, but it's in every state. Because it's so light, the wind carries ragweed pollen far. Researchers have found ragweed pollen 2 miles up in the atmosphere and 400 miles out at sea. Avoiding ragweed may be impossible. But there are ways to limit your exposure -- and lower your risk of symptoms. During ragweed season you should: Track pollen counts. Check them in the newspaper or on the web. Stay inside when they're high. Avoid peak ragweed hours. Limit your time outside between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Counts are lower in the early morning and late afternoon. Keep windows closed. At home and in the car, don't open the windows. Using central air conditioning with a HEPA filter will keep you cool and help filter out pollen. Change your clothes and wash your hands after you've been outside. Ragweed can stick to skin or clothing. Watch out for food triggers. Eating foods that contain similar proteins to ragweed pollen proteins can worsen symptoms. Possible triggers are: Bananas Melons Honey Sunflower seeds Chamomile tea Don't dry laundry outside. It will pick up ragweed pollen. Dry your laundry in a dryer. Staying away from ragweed may not be enough. You may get help from: Testing to make sure that you really have a ragweed allergy Over-the-counter or prescription medications For most people with frequent symptoms, nasal steroids are the best treatment. If your symptoms are more mild, an oral antihistamine may be enough. Both are available over-the-counter. Early treatment. If your doctor says it's OK, start taking medications 2 weeks before ragweed season starts. That way you can stop the allergic reaction before it starts. Allergy shots, which can -- over the course of months or years -- get your body to develop a tolerance to ragweed so it no longer triggers an allergic reaction. Oral tablets placed under the tongue contain the same type of extracts used in allergy shots."
405,"When you think about diabetes drugs, you may think of insulin or other medications that you get from a shot or a pump. But there are others that you take as a pill or that you inhale. Your doctor will consider exactly what you need, which may include more than one type of diabetes medicine. The goal is to get your best blood sugar control, and the oral drugs do that in several ways. Acarbose ( Precose) How it works: Blocks enzymes that help digest starches, slowing the rise in blood sugar. It belongs to a group of drugs called âalpha-glucosidase inhibitors.â Side effects for these kinds of drugs include stomach upset (gas, diarrhea, nausea, cramps). Alogliptin ( Nesina) How it works: Boosts insulin levels when blood sugars are too high, and tells the liver to cut back on making sugars. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â DPP- IV inhibitor.â These drugs do not cause weight gain. You may take them alone or with another drug, like metformin. Bromocriptine mesylate ( Cycloset, Parlodel) How it works: This tablet raises the level of dopamine, a brain chemical. It's approved help improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. It's not used to treat type 1 diabetes. Canagliflozin ( Invokana) How it works: Boosts how much glucose leaves your body in urine, and blocks your kidney from reabsorbing glucose. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â SGLT2 inhibitor.â Side effects can include: Vaginal yeast infections Urinary tract infections Dizziness, fainting Ketoacidosis or ketosis Increased risk of bone fracture Decreased bone mineral density Chlorpropamide ( Diabinese) How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin. Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â This drug is not used as often as newer sulfonylureas. Side effects of sulfonylureas include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Colesevelam ( Welchol) How it works: Lowers âbadâ ( LDL) cholesterol and improves blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Your doctor will call this type of drug a âbile acid sequestrant.â Dapagliflozin ( Farxiga) How it works: Boosts how much glucose leaves your body in urine, and blocks your kidney from reabsorbing glucose. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â SGLT2 inhibitor.â Empagliflozin ( Jardiance) How it works: Boosts how much glucose leaves your body in urine, and blocks your kidney from reabsorbing glucose. Your doctor may call this type of drug a â SGLT2 inhibitor.â Glimepiride ( Amaryl) How it works: Lowers blood sugar by prompting the pancreas to release more insulin.

Your doctor may call this type of drug âsulfonylureas.â Side effects of sulfonylureas include: Low blood sugar Upset stomach Skin rash or itching Weight gain Inhaled Insulin ( Afrezza) How you take it: You put a cartridge, which contains a dose of this powdered, rapid-acting insulin, into an inhaler, and you use it before meals or soon after you start to eat. How it works: The insulin quickly moves from lung cells into the bloodstream. It doesn't replace long-acting insulin (which you can't inhale). You should not use it if you have a long-term lung disease, such as asthma or COPD, or if you smoke. It's not recommended for treating diabetic ketoacidosis. Linagliptin ( Tradjenta) How it works: Boosts insulin levels when blood sugars are too high, and tells the liver to cut back on making sugars.

406,"Irregular or abnormal ovulation accounts for 30% to 40% of all cases of infertility. Having irregular periods, no periods, or abnormal bleeding often indicates that you aren't ovulating, a condition known clinically as anovulation. Although anovulation can usually be treated with fertility drugs, it is important to be evaluated for other conditions that could interfere with ovulation, such as thyroid conditions or abnormalities of the adrenal or pituitary glands. Once your doctor has ruled out other medical conditions, he or she may prescribe fertility drugs to stimulate your ovulation. The drug contained in both Clomid and Serophene (clomiphene) is often a first choice because it's effective and has been prescribed to women for decades. Unlike many infertility drugs, it also has the advantage of being taken orally instead of by injection. It is used to induce ovulation and to correct irregular ovulation by increasing egg recruitment by the ovaries. Clomiphene induces ovulation in most women with anovulation. Up to 10% of women who use clomiphene for infertility will have a multiple gestation pregnancy -- usually twins. ( In comparison, just 1% of the general population of women delivers twins.) The typical starting dosage of clomphene is 50 milligrams per day for five days, beginning on the third, fourth, or fifth day after your period begins. You can expect to start ovulating about seven days after you've taken the last dose of clomiphene. If you don't ovulate, the dose can be increased by 50 milligrams per day each month up to 150 mg. After you've begun to ovulate, most doctors suggest taking Clomid for 3-6 months before referring to a specialist. If you haven't gotten pregnant by then, you would try a different medication or get a referral to an infertility specialist. These fertility drugs sometimes make the cervical mucus ""hostile"" to sperm, keeping sperm from swimming into the uterus. This can be overcome by using artificial or intrauterine insemination( IUI) -- injecting specially prepared sperm directly into the uterus -- to fertilize the egg. It also thins the endometrial lining. Depending on your situation, your doctor may also suggest other fertility drugs such as Gonal- F or other injectable hormones that stimulate follicles and stimulate egg development in the ovaries. These are the so-called ""super-ovulation"" drugs. Most of these drugs are administered by injection just under the skin. Some of these hormones may overstimulate the ovaries (causing abdominal bloating and discomfort). This can be dangerous and require hospitalization; thus, your doctor will monitor you with frequent vaginal ultrasounds and blood tests to monitor estrogen levels. About 90% of women ovulate with these drugs and between 20% and 60% become pregnant. A common ovulation problem that affects about 5% to 10% of women in their reproductive years is polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can cause the ovaries not to work. In most cases, the ovaries become enlarged and appear covered with tiny, fluid-filled cysts. Symptoms include: No periods, irregular periods, or irregular bleeding No ovulation or irregular ovulation Obesity or weight gain (although thin women may have PCOS) Insulin resistance (an indicator of prediabetes) High blood pressure Abnormal cholesterol with high triglycerides Excess hair growth on the body and face (hirsutism) Acne or oily skin Thinning hair or male-pattern baldness If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight is one way to improve your chances of pregnancy. Your doctor also might prescribe medication to lower your insulin levels, since elevated insulin levels -- caused by your body's inability to recognize insulin -- has been found to be a common problem among many women with PCOS. Chronically elevated insulin levels can also lead to diabetes. Women with PCOS may be at higher risk for developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and endometrial cancer, especially if PCOS is untreated. PCOS can't be cured, but there are treatments available to treat the symptoms of PCOS and the infertility associated with this condition. By stimulating ovulation, especially in women trying to conceive, and treating insulin resistance, regular ovulation and periods often are restored. A procedure known as in vitro fertilization, or IVF, is another potential treatment for women with PCOS. For couples struggling with infertility, it's a particularly cruel fact: Not only can infertility cause a lot of stress, but stress may affect fertility. It's known to contribute to problems with ovulation. For many people, the longer you go without conceiving, the more stress you feel. Fears about infertility may also lead to tension with your partner, and that can reduce your chances of pregnancy even further. After all, it's hard to have sex if one of you sleeps on the couch. While it's a fact that coping with infertility is stressful, that doesn't mean you have to give into it. If your doctor can't find a medical cause for your ovulation problems, consider finding support groups or a therapist who can help you learn better ways to cope with the anxieties that come with infertility. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine offers these tips for reducing stress: Keep the lines of communication open with your partner. Get emotional support. A couples' counselor, support groups, or books can help you cope. Try out some stress-reduction techniques such as meditation or yoga. Cut down on caffeine and other stimulants. Exercise regularly to release your physical and emotional tension. Agree on a medical treatment plan, including financial limits, with your partner. Learn as much as you can about the cause of your infertility and your treatment options."

Because blood in urine can be a sign of a serious medical condition, however, it shouldn't be ignored. All cases of hematuria should be evaluated by a doctor who can order tests to confirm or rule out an underlying cause. There is no specific treatment for hematuria, because it's a symptom and not a specific condition. Instead, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause if one can be found. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Blood in urine can come from the kidneys, where urine is made. It also can come from other structures in the urinary tract, such as: Ureters (the tubes from the kidneys to the bladder) Bladder (where urine is stored) Urethra (the tube from the bladder to the outside of the body) If there is blood in urine, the symptom is obvious. Instead of its normal pale yellow color, your urine may be pink, red, brownish-red, or tea-colored. This is what doctors call gross hematuria. Sometimes, blood in urine is not visible to the naked eye and the presence of red blood cells can only be detected by the lab. This is what doctors call microscopic hematuria. It's usually only discovered when a urine sample is tested with a dipstick and the results are confirmed with a microscopic examination. Hematuria may occur without any other symptoms. Some underlying causes, however, are associated with additional symptoms that can be moderate to severe. These include: Bladder infections (acute cystitis). In adults, bladder infections usually cause burning or pain with urination. Infants with bladder infections may have fever, be irritable, and feed poorly. Older children may have fever, pain and burning while urinating, urgency, and lower belly pain. Kidney infections (pyelonephritis). Symptoms may include fever, chills, and flank pain, which refers to pain in the lower back. Kidney stones. Symptoms may include severe abdominal or pelvic pain. Kidney diseases. Symptoms may include weakness, high blood pressure, and body swelling, including puffiness around the eyes. Common causes of blood in urine include: Bladder or kidney infections Bladder or kidney stones Certain kidney diseases, such as inflammation in the filtering system of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis) Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) or prostate cancer Inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia and cystic kidney disease Certain medications such as aspirin, penicillin, heparin, cyclophosphamide, and phenazopyridine A tumor in the bladder, kidney, or prostate Kidney injury from an accident or sports Vigorous exercise Sometimes, what appears to be blood in urine is actually red pigment from other sources such as food dyes, medications, or an excessive amount of beets. Doctors refer to this latter cause as ""beeturia."" Your doctor will start by taking a medical history and asking what may have caused the appearance of blood in your urine. This will be followed by a test called urinalysis. In this test, a urine sample is analyzed. Urine tests may include urine cytology, which uses a microscope to look for abnormal cells in the urine. Blood tests may also be ordered. If blood contains high levels of wastes that kidneys are supposed to remove, it could be a sign of kidney disease. In addition to urine and blood tests, you may need additional imaging tests. These may include: Computed tomography ( CT) scan. A CT, which is a special X-ray scan, can help identify bladder or kidney stones, tumors, and other abnormalities of the bladder, kidneys, and ureters. Kidney ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the kidney's structure. Intravenous pyelogram ( IVP). This is an X-ray of the urinary tract that requires dye. Cystoscopy. This test involves the insertion of a small tube with a camera into the bladder through the urethra. Tissue samples (biopsy) may be obtained to check for the presence of abnormal or cancerous cells. Kidney (renal) biopsy. A small tissue sample is removed from the kidney and examined under a microscope for signs of kidney disease. Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause. After treatment, your doctor will recheck your urine to see if the blood is gone. If you still have blood in your urine, you may need additional tests, or you may be referred to a urologist. Usually, no treatment is necessary unless a serious condition is causing the hematuria. If no underlying cause is found during the initial evaluation, you may be advised to have follow-up urine testing and blood pressure monitoring every three to six months, especially if you have risk factors for bladder cancer, such as being age 50 or older, smoking cigarettes, or exposure to certain industrial chemicals."
408,"You've got a cough, your throat's sore, and your nose is stuffed up. Sounds like a cold, right? It might be something more than that if you've been sniffly for over a week, or if your symptoms seem to be getting worse. Here's how to get a sense of what might be making you feel under the weather. These typically last 3 to 10 days. You could have symptoms like: A runny nose -- with or without green or yellow mucus A stuffy nose Sneezing Watery eyes Sore throat Cough Try to rest up while the cold runs its course. There's probably no need to call your doctor unless your symptoms are severe or you have other medical problems. Pick up the phone if you have any of these symptoms. It could mean you have something more than a cold: Fever higher than 102 F with tiredness and body aches Severe vomiting Severe sinus pain in your face or forehead Swollen glands in your neck or jaw Call 911 for any of these problems: Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Chest pain or pressure Fainting or feeling faint Feeling foggy or confused Sometimes a cold causes swelling in the nose or lungs. That can lead to other problems, like these: Sinus infection (sinusitis): This happens when a cold virus infects your sinuses -- the hollow areas in the bones of your cheeks, forehead, and under your eyes. These areas swell, and your body makes more mucus. It's a perfect place for bacteria to grow and thrive. You may get a headache, fever, and some or all of these symptoms: A severely stuffed up nose Less sense of smell and taste Thick yellow or green mucus Achy teeth Pain or pressure near your sinuses that gets worse when you bend over A cough that's worse at night Bad breath See your doctor if these symptoms are severe, you still feel bad after 7 days, or if you get better and then get worse. Get emergency medical help right away if you have one or more of these problems. They could be warning signs of something more serious, like meningitis: Fever over 102 F Sudden, severe pain in the face or head Double vision or trouble seeing Confusion or problems thinking clearly Swelling or redness around one or both eyes Stiff neck Shortness of breath Bronchitis (a chest cold): You get it when the large tubes that carry air into your lungs become swollen and irritated. Telltale symptoms of this illness can include: A cough that could last 10 to 20 days A cough that produces green, yellow, or clear mucus Most of the time, you don't need to see a doctor for bronchitis. But call yours ASAP if you have any of these symptoms -- you could have pneumonia: Fever above 100.4 F A cough that is not better after 7 to 10 days Unexplained weight loss Get emergency care or call 911 for any of these symptoms: Chest pain or trouble breathing with your cough Coughing up blood A barking cough that makes it hard for you to talk or swallow If you're over 75 and have a cough that won't stop, see your doctor. You could have bronchitis, even if you don't have any other symptoms. Ear infection : Colds, bronchitis, and sinus infections can keep fluid trapped in your ear behind your eardrum. When this happens, bacteria or viruses can grow and cause an infection. Warning signs of an ear infection can include: Fullness or pressure in one or both ears Pain in one or both of them Fluid that drains from your ear Muffled hearing See your doctor right away if you have a high fever or severe pain in your ear. Hacking and sneezing are normal when you have a cold. Other problems, like a high fever, aren't. If any of your symptoms concern you, put your mind at ease -- call the doctor."
409,"About one in three adults in the U. S. have high blood pressure. More than 90% of adults who survive into their 80s will develop elevated blood pressure -- also called hypertension -- and about 50% of people will have it by age 60. Although high blood pressure is common, it's not harmless. High blood pressure is a major cause of atherosclerosis, the artery-clogging process that leads to heart attacks and strokes. Blood pressure higher than 130/80 is seen in: 69% of people who have their first heart attack 77% of people who have their first stroke 74% of people who have congestive heart failure High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, even if it is severely elevated. Only 35% of people with high blood pressure have it under control. If you're one of the millions of people with uncontrolled hypertension, your arteries may be paying the price. Blood pressure is the pressure inside the arteries. It's reported in two numbers; for example, ""125 over 80."" What do these numbers mean? The top number is the systolicblood pressure. This is the peak pressure, when the heart pumps and expands the arteries. The bottom number is the diastolicblood pressure. When the heart relaxes, the pressure in the arteries falls to this value. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 over less than 80. Treatment is recommended for blood pressure above 130 over 80 for most people. Treatment may be considered at lower levels, depending on other medical conditions you may have. When the heart beats, it pushes blood through the arteries in your entire body. Higher blood pressures mean that with each beat, arteries throughout the body swell and stretch more than they would normally. This stretching can injure the endothelium, the delicate lining of all arteries, causing arteries to become stiffer over time. Healthy endothelium actively works to prevent atherosclerosis -- also called hardening of the arteries -- from developing. Injured endothelium, on the other hand, allows more ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and white blood cells to enter the lining of the artery. The cholesterol and cells build up in the artery wall, eventually forming the plaque of atherosclerosis. Plaque is dangerous. Although it often grows without symptoms for years, plaque can suddenly rupture, forming a blood clot that blocks the artery, which keeps oxygen from getting to the heart muscle or the brain. The result can be a heart attack or stroke. Because high blood pressure increases the risk of atherosclerosis, it raises the chance of developing all the complications of atherosclerosis, such as: Heart attack Stroke Peripheral arterial disease Erectile dysfunction Kidney disease When it comes to causing atherosclerosis, though, high blood pressure rarely acts alone. High blood pressure in isolation increases the risk of atherosclerosis, but it's particularly dangerous when it in combination with: Diabetes Abnormal cholesterol levels Cigarette smoking If you have any of these other risk factors and hypertension, your risk of atherosclerosis begins to rise dramatically. Treating high blood pressure can provide dramatic protection against atherosclerosis. Much of the decline in the death rate from heart attacks and strokes is due to improved treatment of high blood pressure over the past 50 years. For example, in middle-aged and older adults with high blood pressure, lowering systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 10 points leads to: 50% to 60% lower risk of dying from stroke 40% to 50% lower risk of death from a heart attack Exercise and a low-salt diet that is high in fruits and vegetables will reduce blood pressure by a moderate amount. Weight management is also important in maintaining a healthy blood pressure. For most people, though, medication is necessary to adequately control high blood pressure. In fact, most people will eventually require two or more drugs for blood pressure. Numerous drugs effectively treat hypertension. No particular medicine has been proven better than the others at preventing atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is the most common of the risk factors for atherosclerosis. It's also easily detectable and treatable. Most drugstores and almost all fire stations provide free blood pressure checks, and good medications that you can take without side effects or complications are available. Don't fly blind: get checked, know your numbers, and get treated if you have hypertension."
410,"Heat stroke is the most serious form of heat injury and is considered a medical emergency. If you suspect that someone has heat stroke -- also known as sunstroke -- call 911 immediately and give first aid until paramedics arrive. Heat stroke can kill or cause damage to the brain and other internal organs. Although heat stroke mainly affects people over age 50, it also takes a toll on healthy young athletes. Heat stroke often occurs as a progression from milder heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat syncope (fainting), and heat exhaustion. But it can strike even if you have no previous signs of heat injury. Heat stroke results from prolonged exposure to high temperatures -- usually in combination with dehydration -- which leads to failure of the body's temperature control system. The medical definition of heat stroke is a core body temperature greater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, with complications involving the central nervous system that occur after exposure to high temperatures. Other common symptoms include nausea, seizures, confusion, disorientation, and sometimes loss of consciousness or coma. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Video', id: 'ia-video-1', position: 'left', mode: 'interactive', video: { chronicle ID: '091e9c5e80f631a6', title: ' Heat Stroke', description: ' Learn the newest thinking about what to do in case of heat stroke.

But fainting may be the first sign. Other symptoms may include: Throbbing headache Dizziness and light-headedness Lack of sweating despite the heat Red, hot, and dry skin Muscle weakness or cramps Nausea and vomiting Rapid heartbeat, which may be either strong or weak Rapid, shallow breathing Behavioral changes such as confusion, disorientation, or staggering Seizures Unconsciousness If you suspect that someone has a heat stroke, immediately call 911 or transport the person to a hospital. Any delay seeking medical help can be fatal. While waiting for the paramedics to arrive, initiate first aid. Move the person to an air-conditioned environment -- or at least a cool, shady area -- and remove any unnecessary clothing. If possible, take the person's core body temperature and initiate first aid to cool it to 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. ( If no thermometers are available, don't hesitate to initiate first aid.) Try these cooling strategies: Fan air over the patient while wetting his or her skin with water from a sponge or garden hose. Apply ice packs to the patient's armpits, groin, neck, and back. Because these areas are rich with blood vessels close to the skin, cooling them may reduce body temperature. Immerse the patient in a shower or tub of cool water. If the person is young and heathy and suffered heat stroke while exercising vigorously -- what's known as exertional heat stroke -- you can use an ice bath to help cool the body. Do not use ice for older patients, young children, patients with chronic illness, or anyone whose heat stroke occurred without vigorous exercise. Doing so can be dangerous. If emergency response is delayed, call the hospital emergency room for additional instructions. Heat stroke is most likely to affect older people who live in apartments or homes lacking air conditioning or good airflow. Other high-risk groups include people of any age who don't drink enough water, have chronic diseases, or who drink excessive amounts of alcohol. Heat stroke is strongly related to the heat index, which is a measurement of how hot you feel when the effects of relative humidity and air temperature are combined. A relative humidity of 60% or more hampers sweat evaporation, which hinders your body's ability to cool itself. The risk of heat-related illness dramatically increases when the heat index climbs to 90 degrees or more. So it's important -- especially during heat waves -- to pay attention to the reported heat index, and also to remember that exposure to full sunshine can increase the reported heat index by 15 degrees. If you live in an urban area, you may be especially prone to develop heat stroke during a prolonged heat wave, particularly if there are stagnant atmospheric conditions and poor air quality. In what is known as the ""heat island effect,"" asphalt and concrete store heat during the day and only gradually release it at night, resulting in higher nighttime temperatures. Other risk factors associated with heat-related illness include: Age. Infants and children up to age 4, and adults over age 65, are particularly vulnerable because they adjust to heat more slowly than other people. Health conditions. These include heart, lung, or kidney disease, obesity or underweight, high blood pressure, diabetes, mental illness, sickle cell trait, alcoholism, sunburn, and any conditions that cause fever. Medications. These include antihistamines, diet pills, diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, seizure medications (anticonvulsants), heart and blood pressure medications such as beta-blockers and vasoconstrictors, and medications for psychiatric illnesses such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. Illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine also are associated with increased risk of heat stroke. People with diabetes -- who are at increased risk of emergency room visits, hospitalization, and death from heat-related illness -- may be especially likely to underestimate their risk during heat waves, according to a recent study presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting by researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Weather Service. Check with your doctor to see if your health conditions and medications are likely to affect your ability to cope with extreme heat and humidity. When the heat index is high, it's best to stay in an air-conditioned environment. If you must go outdoors, you can prevent heat stroke by taking these steps: Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and a wide-brimmed hat. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor ( SPF) of 30 or more. Drink extra fluids. To prevent dehydration, it's generally recommended to drink at least eight glasses of water, fruit juice, or vegetable juice per day. Because heat-related illness also can result from salt depletion, it may be advisable to substitute an electrolyte-rich sports drink for water during periods of extreme heat and humidity. Take additional precautions when exercising or working outdoors. The general recommendation is to drink 24 ounces of fluid two hours before exercise, and consider adding another 8 ounces of water or sports drink right before exercise. During exercise, you should consume another 8 ounces of water every 20 minutes, even if you don't feel thirsty. Reschedule or cancel outdoor activity. If possible, shift your time outdoors to the coolest times of the day, either early morning or after sunset. Other strategies for preventing heat stroke include: Monitoring the color of your urine. Darker urine is a sign of dehydration. Be sure to drink enough fluids to maintain very light-colored urine. Measuring your weight before and after physical activity. Monitoring lost water weight can help you determine how much fluid you need to drink. Avoid fluids containing caffeine or alcohol, because both substances can make you lose more fluids and worsen heat-related illness. Also, do not take salt tablets unless your doctor has told you to do so. The easiest and safest way to replace salt and other electrolytes during heat waves is to drink sports beverages or fruit juice. Check with your doctor before increasing liquid intake if you have epilepsy or heart, kidney, or liver disease; are on fluid-restricted diets; or have a problem with fluid retention. If you live in an apartment or house without fans or air conditioning, try to spend at least two hours each day -- preferably during the hottest part of the day -- in an air-conditioned environment. At home, draw your curtains, shades, or blinds during the hottest part of the day, and open windows at night on two sides of your building to create cross-ventilation. If you're a senior who either can't afford to buy or run an air conditioner, check with your local Area Agency on Aging for programs that can assist you. One such program is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP). After you've recovered from heat stroke, you'll probably be more sensitive to high temperatures during the following week. So it's best to avoid hot weather and heavy exercise until your doctor tells you that it's safe to resume your normal activities."
411,"There are a number of skin conditions that cause lumps and bumps to appear on the surface or just below the skin. This article covers some of the most common ones, and includes the following: Skin cysts (also called epidermoid cysts) Cherry angioma Dermatofibromas Folliculitis Keratoacanthoma Keratosis pilaris Lipomas Neurofibromas var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Cysts are noncancerous, closed pockets of tissue that can be filled with fluid, pus, or other material. Cysts are common on the skin and can appear anywhere. They feel like large peas under the surface of the skin. Cysts can develop as a result of infection, clogging of sebaceous glands (oil glands), or around foreign bodies, such as earrings. Skin or epidermoid cysts usually are: Slow-growing Painless Smooth to the touch when they are rolled under the skin Cysts usually do not cause pain unless they rupture or become infected or inflamed. Most cysts do not disappear on their own without treatment. Some cysts may need to be drained to relieve symptoms. That involves piercing the cyst with a scalpel and draining it. That doesn't cure the cyst, however. Some inflamed cysts can be treated with an injection of cortisone medication to cause it to shrink. Cysts that do not respond to other treatments or reoccur can be removed surgically if they cause troublesome symptoms. A cherry angioma is a smooth, cherry-red bump on the skin. The size of the growths can vary from the size of a pinhead to about a quarter inch in diameter. Although cherry angiomas usually appear on the trunk of the body, they can occur nearly anywhere. The cause of cherry angiomas is not known. The growths usually appear on people over age 40. In children, these lesions are called port-wine stains. Cherry angiomas have no symptoms. In most cases, cherry angiomas do not require treatment. If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding, angiomas may be removed by lasers, shave biopsy, or electrocautery -- the process of burning or destroying tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it. Removal may cause scarring. Learn more about red birthmarks and your skin. Dermatofibromas are harmless round, red-brownish skin growths that are most commonly found on the arms and legs of adults. Dermatofibromas contains scar tissue and feel like hard lumps in the skin. Sometimes dermatofibromas appear after injury, like a bug bite or after bumping your arm or leg. The symptoms of dermatofibromas include: A red, brown, or purple growth that can change colors over time A growth that is as small as a BB pellet Tenderness, pain, and itching; however, growths are usually painless A dimple that appears when the growth is pinched In most cases, there is no need to treat dermatofibromas. However, the growths can be removed surgically or can be flattened by being frozen with liquid nitrogen. See a photo of what a dermatofibroma looks like. Epidermoid cysts, also called sebaceous cysts or skin cysts, are benign (non-cancerous) skin cysts formed by an outpouching from the hair follicle. Most commonly, epidermoid cysts are found on the genitals, chest, and back; but, they also can occur in other areas of the skin. In general, epidermoid or skin cysts have a round appearance. A dark portion of the cyst is visible on the skin. If the cysts become infected, they will become red and tender. When the cysts are squeezed, they can produce a cheesy white discharge. The effective treatment of epidermoid cysts requires that the sac of the cyst be completely removed. If the cyst is squeezed and the discharge is forced out without removing the sac, the cyst will return. Usually, a doctor will be able to remove the cyst by making only a small incision in the skin. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat infected cysts and intralesional steroid injections help with swelling and inflammation. Learn more about skin cysts. Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles. It can be caused by an infection in the hair follicles, by chemical irritation or by physical irritation (for example, shaving or friction from clothing). Typical body sites that are involved in folliculitis include the face, thighs, and scalp. Folliculitis is more common in people who have diabetes. It also is more common in people who are obese or have compromised immune systems. The main lesion in folliculitis is a papule or pustule with a central hair. The hair shaft in the middle of the lesion may not be seen. Other signs and symptoms include: Multiple red pimples and/or pustules on hair-bearing areas of the body Itching skin Topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, or antifungal drugs may be used to treat infections associated with folliculitis, depending on the underlying cause. Treatment also involves preventing further damage to the hair follicles. Steps that can help achieve this goal include: Minimizing friction from clothing Not shaving in the affected area, if possible. If shaving is necessary, use a clean new razor blade or an electric razor each time. Also moisturize the hair before shaving, and shave in the direction of the growth of the hair Keeping the area clean See a photo of what folliculitis looks like. A keratoancanthoma occurs when cells in a hair follicle do not grow normally. The growth may be triggered by a minor skin injury in an area that previously had suffered sun damage. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the biggest risk factor in keratoacanthomas. A keratoacanthoma usually will appear on sun-damaged skin as a thick growth that has a central crusted plug. Keratoacanthomas appear most often in people who are over the age of 60 and they are considered a low-grade skin cancer. Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, red, dome-shaped bumps with central craters. Some keratoacanthomas can grow to extremely large sizes, occasionally 1 to 3 inches in diameter. Keratoacanthomas can be removed by: Cryotherapy (freezing the growth with liquid nitrogen) Curettage (scraping and burning off the growth) Surgical removal Injection of a cancer drug directly into the lesion Learn more about keratoacanthomas. Keratosis pilaris (commonly called KP) appears as ""chicken skin bumps"" on the skin. These bumps usually appear on the upper arms and thighs. They also can appear on the cheeks, back, and buttocks. Keratosis pilaris, while unattractive, is harmless. This disorder appears as small, rough bumps. The bumps are usually white or red, but do not itch or hurt. Keratosis pilaris is usually worse during the winter months or other times of low humidity when skin becomes dry. It also may worsen during pregnancy or after childbirth. Although the condition may remain for years, it gradually improves before age 30 in most cases. Treatment of keratosis pilaris is not medically necessary; but, individuals with this condition may want to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons. The initial treatment of keratosis pilaris should be intensive moisturizing. A cream such as Am Lactin or Lac- Hydrin can be applied after bathing, and then re-applied several times a day. Other treatments may include: Medicated creams containing urea ( Carmol-20) or alpha-hydroxy acids ( Aqua Glycolic, Lacticare) applied twice daily Efforts to unplug pores by taking long, hot soaking tub baths and then rubbing and exfoliating the areas with a coarse washcloth or stiff brush Learn more about keratosis pilaris. Lipomas are subcutaneous soft tissue tumors that usually are slow-growing and are harmless. They have a soft, rubbery consistency. Lipomas tend to form on the trunk, shoulders, neck, but can appear elsewhere on the body. Lipomas can appear as solitary nodules or in groups. Most lipomas are less than 5 cm in diameter and have no symptoms, but they can cause pain when they compress nerves. Lipomas are not removed unless there is a cosmetic concern, a compression of surrounding structures, or an uncertain diagnosis. Lipomas generally do not infiltrate into surrounding tissue so they can be removed easily by excision. There are alternatives to standard excision. One is to manually squeeze the lipoma through a small incision. This technique is useful in areas with thin dermis, such as the face and extremities. Liposuction-assisted lipectomy also can be used to remove large lipomas with minimal scarring. Lipotherapy is another option. In this, a fat dissolving drug called deoxycholic acid ( Kybella) is injected directly into the lipoma, leaving no scarring. Learn more about lipomas. Neurofibromas are soft, fleshy growths that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are harmless tumors; however, they can turn malignant or cancerous in rare cases. The symptoms of neurofibromas may vary, depending on the locations and the sizes of the tumors. Symptoms can include: A painless, slow-growing mass Occasional pain Electric-like ""shock"" when the affected area is touched Neurological problems if the tumor involves a major motor or sensory nerve or a nerve that is compressed between the tumor and a hard structure If the tumor is not causing any symptoms, no treatment is necessary. However, doctors may choose to surgically remove the neurofibroma if it is affecting a major nerve. In most cases, neurofibromas are treated successfully and do not recur. See a photo of what neurofibromas looks like."
412,"Red raspberries are very common, whether on your cereal or in a jam jar. The leaves of red raspberry also have been a folk treatment in Europe for hundreds of years. Some pregnant women take red raspberry leaves to try to trigger labor or to ease pain during childbirth. Although many midwives suggest red raspberry leaf during the later stages of pregnancy, there isn't any good evidence that it helps. One study of red raspberry found that it didn't shorten labor or prevent labor pain. Scientists don't know if red raspberry helps in other ways during pregnancy -- like preventing morning sickness or regulating contractions. There's some evidence that red raspberry fruit could affect how the body processes fat. Theoretically, it may help people lose weight, but that's not certain. According to traditional medicine, red raspberry has other uses. People take it to try to: Regulate periods Soothe upset stomach Treat mouth sores No one has studied these uses, so they are unproven. There's no standard dose for red raspberry. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it very hard to establish a standard dose. Red raspberries are a food. The leaves are sometimes used as a natural flavoring. Many people drink red raspberry leaf tea. Tell your doctor about any supplements you're taking, even if they're natural. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with medications. Side effects. As a food, red raspberries are safe. As a treatment, red raspberry leaf seems to be safe for most people. Risks. Red raspberry could start premature labor in pregnant women. If you're pregnant, ask your doctor if it's safe. Red raspberry leaf might have estrogen-like effects. It may not be safe if you have conditions sensitive to estrogen. These include: Endometriosis Uterine fibroids Breast cancer Uterine cancer Red raspberry supplements may not be safe for children or for women who are breastfeeding. Interactions. If you take any medications regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using red raspberry supplements. There's always a risk they could interact with other supplements or drugs."

Though it can resemble other childhood rashes, such as rubella or scarlet fever, fifth disease usually begins with the distinctive, sudden appearance of bright red cheeks that look as though the child has been slapped. The disease is rare in infants and adults. Fifth disease got its name many years ago when it was the fifth on a list of the six recognized childhood rash-forming illnesses; the others include rubella, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox, and roseola infantum. It also is called slapped-cheek disease because of the characteristic initial appearance in children. Fifth disease is usually mild. It is spread by respiratory droplets that enter the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through blood. It poses little risk to healthy children and adults, with a couple of exceptions: pregnant women and people with certain types of chronic anemia. If a pregnant woman is infected in the first half of her pregnancy, there is a small risk of severe anemia in the fetus and a 10% risk of miscarriage. Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19 and is spread by respiratory secretions from an infected person. By the time the rash appears, children are no longer contagious and may attend school or day care. The incubation period (the period between infection and signs or symptoms of illness) is usually four to 14 days, but can be as long as 21 days. Adults who work with young children -- such as child-care providers, teachers, and those in health care fields -- are most likely to be exposed."
414,"Does your husband complain that you never listen? Does your wife say she feels like you're just one more child in the house? Have your friends lost patience with you because you're late all the time? ADHD could be to blame. The condition starts in childhood, but it can stay into adulthood. Some people don't even know they have ADHD until they're adults. And if you have it, it could be causing relationship problems. Learn the red flags and what to do about them. While everyone is different, some common problems seem to affect the relationships of adults with ADHD. Do the following complaints sound familiar to you? 1. '' Do you even hear what I'm saying?'' If you have the condition, your loved ones and friends might have a hard time getting your full attention. That's one reason why they might get frustrated with you. On the other hand, you might feel like they're nagging you. 2. '' You never pull your weight around here.'' Mowing the lawn. Washing the dishes. Folding clothes. Household chores can be a challenge when you have adult ADHD. If the people you live with tell you that you aren't doing enough, take a step back and consider whether they're right. When was the last time you took out the trash? Is your clutter taking over the house? Your family members may be doing more than their fair share of keeping the household running smoothly. 3. '' You never do what you say you're going to do.'' You meant it when you said you'd get to your son's basketball game by 4:30 p.m. You really did. But then you got distracted at work, and your cell phone rang, and then you realized you needed to pick up the dry cleaning. And before you knew it, the game was over -- and you were in the dog house. '' People with ADHD very much intend to do something when they say it. It's not like some problems where people lie or are deceitful,'' says Steven Safren, Ph D, director of behavioral medicine in the department of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. 4. '' How could you forget a-g-a-i-n?'' Do you feel like you're always getting blamed for forgetting things, when you know no one actually told you about them? Consider this: The condition often causes people to forget things they're told. And that can lead to major problems in relationships. If people have been telling you for years that you're forgetful, it might be time to find out if they're right. 5. '' I can't believe you bought that -- you know we can't afford it!'' Fights over finances tend to be another problem. A common ADHD symptom is doing things on impulse, and that includes buying things. Adults with the disorder can have reckless spending habits and trouble saving money. If you think you or someone you care about has adult ADHD, the first thing you should do is learn about the disorder and how it's diagnosed. You can start by looking over free online resources from organizations like Children and Adults with Attention- Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder ( CHADD) and the National Center on ADHD. These sites can help you find local doctors, and support groups where you can meet people facing similar issues. You can also find out how to get tested for the condition. If you're diagnosed with the condition, work with your doctor to deal with the problems you're having day to day. Adult ADHD is often treated with a combo of medications, skills coaching, and psychotherapy, including couples counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy. If you have a spouse or partner, it's important for them to be involved. They often can tell which treatments are or aren't working. â It's a good scenario if someone does have a supportive partner, so they can work together in a positive way to address the disorder,â Safren says. And the sooner you both work on repairing your relationship, the better. Skills training or coaching can help people with adult ADHD come up with and reach relationship goals. This might include building skills that help you manage your time well and get organized. As for how much improvement you can expect in your relationships, experts say each situation is unique. But âusually, couples can make their lives better and recapture some of the joy and romance that might have gone out of the relationship,â says psychologist Arthur Robin, Ph D, professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit."
415,"Antiplatelet drugs are a group of powerful medicines that prevent blood clots. When you are wounded, platelets arrive on the scene and group together to form a clot that stops the bleeding. This is a good thing when an injury involves a break in your skin. But platelets can also group when injury to a blood vessel comes from the inside, as may happen in an artery affected by atherosclerosis. In this situation, the platelets cause blood clots in an already injured artery. Antiplatelet medications can prevent this from happening. Antiplatelets may be prescribed to folks with a history of: Coronary artery disease Heart attack Angina (chest pain) Stroke and transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs) Peripheral artery disease Antiplatelets are also used: After angioplasty and stent placement After heart bypass or valve replacement surgery Usually once or twice a day. You shouldn't take them on an empty stomach. Tell your doctor if you're allergic to aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen before he prescribes you this medicine. People with bleeding problems, ulcers, or who are planning to have surgery, including dental surgery, should talk to their doctor before taking these. They may cause excessive bleeding. You shouldn't stop taking your antiplatelet drug unless your doctor tells you to. These drugs may need to be taken for the rest of your life, depending on your condition. While taking these, ask your doctor what you can take for pain relief or minor colds. Read the labels of other pain relievers and cold products to make sure they are aspirin-free. Medicines containing aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) may cause bleeding problems when taken along with antiplatelet drugs. Before any surgery, dental procedure, or emergency treatment, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking this medicine. You might need to stop taking it for 5 to 7 days before dental work or surgery. However, don't stop this medicine without first talking with your doctor. Use caution during activities requiring you to be alert (like driving a car) until you know how the drug affects you. Antiplatelets can cause: Nausea Upset stomach Stomach pain Diarrhea Rash Itching To ease nausea and stomach upset, take these with meals. Call your doctor if these side effects are severe or don't go away. Contact your doctor right away if you have any of the following while you take antiplatelets: Blood in the urine or stool Nosebleeds Any unusual bruising Heavy bleeding from cuts Black tarry stools Coughing up of blood Unusually heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected vaginal bleeding Vomit that looks like coffee grounds Dizziness Severe headache Difficulty swallowing Shortness of breath Difficulty breathing or wheezing Tightness in chest, chest pain Fever, chills, sore throat Swelling of the face or hands Ringing in the ears Severe stomach pain Side effects can be worse in people with asthma and allergies. If you're expecting or trying, let your doctor know before you take an antiplatelet. Taking them during the last two weeks of pregnancy may cause bleeding problems in the baby or mother before and after delivery. Antiplatelets can be passed to the infant through breast milk. However, their effect on nursing infants is unknown. You should discuss this with your doctor and your baby's doctor."
416,"Colds and flu are no fun, and they can be even worse if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Infections, dehydration, and sugar in some medicines can make it harder to manage your blood sugar. You can take steps to help prevent those problems and stay well. Your best move is to get a flu shot every year. The CDC recommends that for everyone age 6 months and older, so if you have a child with diabetes, make sure that they get vaccinated, too. A flu vaccine can prevent many types of flu or keep flu viruses from making you so ill. September may be the best month to get this vaccine because it protects you for about 6 months. But you can get a flu shot at any time during flu season. Also, ask your doctor if you need the pneumonia shot. This vaccine can also help protect you from blood infections and meningitis. The main problem for people with diabetes is that some cold and flu drugs, such as cough syrups, have sugar in them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend over-the-counter drugs that are safe for you. Keep those product names handy for future reference. Don't give cold and flu medicines to a child younger than 2, whether they have diabetes or not, because of the risk of serious side effects. Everyone gets a cold or flu sometime. Your doctor, nurse, or diabetes educator can help you prepare. They'll probably recommend that you do the following in addition to regular things like staying home from work, school, or day care if you're too sick to go. Check your blood sugar levels every 4 hours, or as often as recommended by your doctor. Test for ketones if your blood sugar level is over 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L). Call your doctor if it shows any ketones. Take your temperature regularly. Drink one cup of liquid every hour you're awake. Water and broth are good choices. Try to eat 35-50 grams of carbohydrates every 3 to 4 hours. If you can't eat solid food, try clear soup, regular soft drinks, Popsicles, unsweetened applesauce, apple juice, or sports drinks. Keep taking insulin or other diabetes medications unless your doctor tells you not to. If you or your child has diabetes as well as what you think might be the flu, call your doctor right away so you can start treatment to help prevent serious complications. For adults, call your doctor if your symptoms are really bad, have lasted for a few days, or if you've had a fever that won't let up. You should also call if: It's hard to breathe. Your blood sugar level remains higher than 180 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d L). Your blood sugar level remains lower than 70 mg/d L. You cannot keep down solids or liquids. Your temperature is over 101 F. You have vomiting or diarrhea. For children, call the doctor if they have: Trouble breathing Blue lips Won't eat or drink Ear pain A fever of 102 F or higher (or any temperature if it's a baby age 2 months or younger) A lot more crankiness or sleepiness than usual Worsening symptoms"
417,"They're not always as obvious as you might think. That's because domestic abuse is about controlling someone's mind and emotions as much as hurting their body. Being abused can leave you scared and confused. It can be hard for you to see your partner's actions for what they really are. Usually, physical abuse isn't what comes first. The abuse can creep up slowly. A putdown here or there. An odd excuse to keep you away from family or friends. The violence often ramps up once you've been cut off from other people. By then, you feel trapped. If you're afraid of your partner, that's a big red flag. You may be scared to say what you think, to bring up certain topics, or to say no to sex. No matter the reason, fear has no place in a healthy relationship. If you feel like you're being abused, there's a good chance you may be, and it's worth getting help. Keep that in mind as you think about these signs: Your partner bullies, threatens, or controls you: Accuses you of having an affair Blames you for abuse Criticizes you Tells you what to wear and how you should look Threatens to kill you or someone close to you Throws things or punches walls when angry Yells at you and makes you feel small Your partner controls your money: Keeps cash and credit cards from you Puts you on an allowance and makes you explain every dollar you spend Keeps you from working whatever job you want Steals money from you or your friends Won't let you have money for basic needs like food and clothes Your partner cuts you off from family and friends: Keeps close tabs on where you go and whom you go with Makes you ask for an OK to see friends and family Embarrasses you in front of others, and it makes you want to avoid people Your partner physically abuses you: Abandons you in a place you don't know Attacks you with weapons Keeps you from eating, sleeping, or getting medical care Locks you in or out of your house Punches, pushes, kicks, bites, pulls hair Your partner sexually abuses you: Forces you to have sex Makes you dress in a sexual way Makes you feel like you owe them sex Tries to give you an STD Won't use condoms or other birth control Keep an eye out for things like: Excuses for injuries Personality changes, like low self-esteem in someone who was always confident Constantly checking in with their partner Never having money on hand Overly worried about pleasing their partner Skipping out on work, school, or social outings for no clear reason Wearing clothes that don't fit the season, like long sleeves in summer to cover bruises They're often the same. And that's true whether the abusive partner is a woman or another man. It may be emotional or verbal, like taking away keys, medicines, or other essentials. Or things like constantly putting you down in public or on social media. And, it can be physical. To make up for differences in strength, abusive partners may try to attack you in your sleep, by surprise, or with weapons and other objects. They may also abuse your children or pets. Again, there's a lot in common, but the abuse may also target sexual orientation or gender identity. Your abuser may: Make excuses for abuse, like it's just how men are or that you wanted it to happen Tell you that police or others won't help because of your gender or orientation Tell you that you're not really how you identify Threaten to out you to family, friends, and others First, know that you deserve better and that this isn't your fault. If you're in an emergency, call 911. It can be hard to decide whether to stay or leave. That's why it may help to start with a call to the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799- SAFE (1-800-799-7233). Call from a friend's house or somewhere else where you feel safe. You can also turn to friends, family, neighbors, your doctor, or your spiritual community. Also make sure you have an emergency escape plan: Hide a set of car keys. Pack a bag with keys, extra clothes, important papers, money, and medicines. You might keep it at a friend's house. Have a plan for calling the police in an emergency. You might have a code word so your kids, family, friends, or co-workers know you're in danger. Know where you'll go and how you'll get there. Say something. You might have your doubts. But if you're thinking about it, there's usually a reason. Someone's life could be in danger. When you talk to the person, you can: Ask if anything is wrong Talk specifically about what concerns you Listen carefully Let the person know you're always there to talk and that your conversations are always private Offer to help Support the person's choices"

They're part of your urinary tract, which makes pee (urine) and removes it from your body. Like the exhaust system on your car, you want everything in good working order so waste moves in one direction only: out. The urinary tract is made up of your: Kidneys (to clean waste from your blood and make pee) Ureters (thin tubes, one for each kidney, that carry pee to your bladder) Bladder : (stores pee) Urethra: (carries pee from the bladder to outside your body) If any of these parts get bacteria in them, you can get a urinary tract infection ( UTI). Most often, it's the bladder that gets infected. It can be painful, but not usually too serious. But if those bacteria travel up the ureters, you can have a much more serious problem: a kidney infection. Doctors sometimes call this âpyelonephritis.â You need to have a kidney infection treated right away. If you don't, it can lead to life-threatening problems. Usually, it starts with a bladder infection that spreads to the kidney. Usually, bacteria called E. coli cause the infection to begin with. Other bacteria can also cause kidney infections. It's rare, but you can also have an infection that gets in through your skin, makes its way into your blood, then travels to your kidney. You can get an infection after kidney surgery, too, but that's very uncommon. Anyone can. But just as women get more bladder infections than men, they also get more kidney infections. A woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, and it's closer to the vagina and anus, where bacteria live. That means it's easier for bacteria to get into a woman's urethra, and once they do, it's a shorter trip to the bladder. From there, they can spread to the kidneys. Pregnant women are even more likely to get bladder infections because the baby can put pressure on the woman's ureters and slow the flow of urine. Any problem in your urinary tract that prevents pee from flowing forward can raise your chances of a kidney infection, such as: Blockage in the urinary tract, like a kidney stone or enlarged prostate Conditions that keep the bladder from completely emptying Structural problem in the urinary tract, like a pinched urethra Vesicoureteral reflux ( VUR), a condition where pee flows backward from the bladder toward the kidneys You are also more likely to get one if you have: Nerve damage in your bladder A prostate infection, known as prostatitis A urinary catheter, a tube that goes unto your urethra and drains pee A weaker immune system, as with type 2 diabetes You may have: Blood or pus in your pee Fever and chills No desire to eat Pain in your lower back, side, or groin Throwing up or upset stomach Weakness or feeling very tired (fatigue) You may also have some of the same signs and symptoms as with a bladder infection, such as: Burning or pain when you pee Constant urge to pee, even though you just went Cloudy or bad-smelling urine Pain in your lower belly Peeing much more often than normal Call your doctor if you have these symptoms and think it may be a kidney infection, especially if you have a UTI and you're not getting any better. If you don't get treated, it could lead to kidney damage or blood infection, which is life-threatening. Also, if you're pregnant, a kidney infection can affect your baby. After asking about your signs and symptoms, your doctor will likely start with a: Urine analysis to check for blood, pus, and bacteria in your pee Urine culture to see what kind of bacteria you have Your doctor may also use these tests: Ultrasound or CT: to check for a blockage in your urinary tract. These are usually done if treatment doesn't help within the first 3 days. Voiding cystourethrogram ( VCUG): a type of X-ray to look for problems in your urethra and bladder. These are often used in children who have VUR. Digital rectal exam (for men): ( Your doctor inserts a lubed finger into your anus to check for a swollen prostate.) Dimercaptosuccinic acid ( DMSA) scintigraphy: a type of imaging that uses a radioactive material to better see kidney infection and damage Usually, the first step is antibiotics, which you may need for a week or two. Your symptoms should improve within a few days, but make sure to finish the medicine as your doctor tells you to. For severe infections, you'll need to stay in the hospital and get antibiotics through an IV. If you get kidney infections that keep coming back, you may have a structural problem in your urinary tract. For that, your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a urologist, who treats urinary tract problems. These types of issues often need surgery. To help ease your symptoms, you can: Drink plenty of fluids to flush out the bacteria. Get extra rest. Sit on the toilet, don't squat over it, which can prevent your bladder from completely emptying Take a pain reliever with acetaminophen but avoid aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Use a heating pad on your belly, back, or side You can't completely prevent all bladder infections. But you may be less likely to get one if you: Avoid deodorant sprays or douches on your genitals Don't use condoms or diaphragms with spermicide. It can trigger bacteria growth. But do use lubricated condoms, since without lube it can irritate the urethra, which makes infection more likely. Drink lots of water. Go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge. Pee after having sex. Wipe front to back after going to the bathroom."
419,"Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, is a way to ""clean"" your blood. It works sort of like kidney dialysis. During the treatment, plasma -- the liquid part of your blood -- gets replaced with plasma from a donor or with a plasma substitute. People with some forms of multiple sclerosis use plasma exchange to manage sudden, severe attacks, sometimes called relapses or flare-ups. Their plasma could have certain proteins that are attacking their own body. When you take out the plasma, you get rid of those proteins, and symptoms may get better. You can get plasma exchange in the hospital or at an outpatient center. The process isn't painful, and you won't need anesthesia. You'll lie in bed or sit in a reclining chair. A nurse or a specialist will put a needle attached to a thin tube, called a catheter, into a vein in each arm. If your arm veins are too small, you may have to have a needle in your shoulder or groin instead. Your blood comes out through one of the tubes and goes into a machine that separates your plasma from your blood cells. Then your blood cells get mixed with fresh plasma, and the new blood mixture goes back into your body through the other tube. Most treatments last 2 to 4 hours, depending on how big your body is and how much plasma gets swapped out. You may need two or three treatments each week for 2 or more weeks. During plasma exchange, your blood pressure is lower than usual. This can make you feel weak, dizzy, or nauseous. Drink lots of water in the days before your treatment, because that can help prevent these symptoms. You may feel tired after plasma exchange, but most people can get back to their normal activities right away. Plasma exchange can cause bleeding and allergic reactions, and it can make your chance of getting an infection higher. In rare cases, a blood clot could form in the machine. Your chance of seeing improvement of MS symptoms is greater if you have a relapsing form of MS and: You're a man. You have Marburg variant MS. Treatment begins within 20 days after your symptoms start. But simpler, less costly treatments often work for MS, so your doctor will probably try those first. For a severe MS attack, your doctor will probably prescribe high doses of anti-inflammatory steroids. If that doesn't relieve your symptoms, then plasma exchange is a short-term option. Plasma exchange hasn't been shown to help primary progressive or secondary progressive MS. It may also help treat other diseases that damage the coating around your spinal cord and nerves, such as Guillain- BarrÃ© syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and myasthenia gravis. After plasma exchange, people with Guillain- BarrÃ© syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are more likely to regain muscle strength and walk without help."
420,"Periorbital cellulitis is an infection of your eyelid or the skin around your eyes. Adults can get it, but children under 2 are most likely to have it. It happens when bacteria attack the soft tissue around your eye, including your eyelid. These germs can get into your skin through a cut or scratch, or they can get to the area through an infection in your sinuses. It also can be a reaction to a stye (a tender bump on your eyelid that forms when a gland on your eyelid gets infected). Periorbital cellulitis is sometimes called preseptal cellulitis because it happens outside a part of your skull called the orbital septum. A layer of tissue keeps the infection from spreading to your eye, so it usually doesn't affect your vision. The most common signs of periorbital cellulitis are: Redness and swelling around the eye A cut, scratch, or insect bite near the eye The skin in the affected area is tender to the touch and might feel a little tough. The white of the eye might look red. Periorbital cellulitis doesn't cause a fever or pain. If you or your child has a fever and swelling and it hurts to move the affected eye, get medical help right away. These things can be caused by a more serious condition called orbital cellulitis that affects the eye itself. If your doctor thinks you or your child might have periorbital cellulitis, they'll start by looking for signs of an injury or a stye. They also might want to see how well your eyes move and respond to light. They may take a sample of blood or any drainage from your eye to test and find out what type of bacteria is causing the problem. She may want to get a closer look with X-rays or a computerized tomography ( CT) scan. This is when X-rays taken from different angles are put together make a more complete picture. If you or your child has periorbital cellulitis, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics, and these should start to work within 24 to 48 hours. You'll probably need to schedule a follow-up visit or two to make sure the infection is completely gone."
421,"A colonoscopy is one of the best ways to spot or help prevent colon cancer. But many people who should have the procedure don't. Often that's because they're afraid of what they have to go through to get ready for it. Your colon has to be empty and clean for your doctor to get a proper look at it. To make that happen, you'll have to fast and use strong laxatives beforehand. It's inconvenient and somewhat unpleasant, but it's temporary, and it might help save your life. Here's how to make the process as smooth as possible. Your doctor is your best source of information about how to get ready. When you schedule the procedure, you'll get instructions. Read them over well before your appointment, and call your doctor if you have any questions. Clear your schedule for the evening before and the day of your colonoscopy, and make plans for someone to go with you the day of the colonoscopy. Shop for some key supplies several days ahead, too. Your list may include: A prescription or over-the-counter laxative specified by your doctor Low-fiber food Sports drinks, juices, and broths Moist wipes Diaper cream You can help the cleansing process by eating light 3 or 4 days before the procedure. Doctors recommend low-fiber foods that are easy to digest and leave your system quickly. You can have: White bread, pasta, and rice Well-cooked vegetables without skin Fruit without skin or seeds Lean meat, chicken, or fish Eggs Don't eat: Seeds, nuts, or popcorn Fatty foods Tough meat Whole grains Raw vegetables Fruit with seeds or peel Corn, broccoli, cabbage, beans, or peas At this point you should stop taking vitamins or other supplements. Ask your doctor whether and when you should stop taking any prescription medicines you use regularly, and any over-the-counter anti-inflammatory or blood thinning meds you may use. The day before your procedure you can't eat anything solid.you can only consume clear (see-through) liquids. It is important to stay hydrated by drinking lots of clear liquids, such as sports drinks, clear juice like apple and white grape, and clear broth. Soda is OK, and so are coffee and tea, but without cream. You can have gelatin and ice pops, but stay away from anything colored red, blue, or purple. The dyes can discolor the lining of the colon and make it harder for the doctor to see. Also avoid alcohol and drinks you can't see through, like milk or orange juice. Two to four hours before the procedure, be sure not to drink or eat anything (please consult your doctor on the exact time stop consuming clear liquids).. The night before your colonoscopy you'll take strong laxatives to clear your digestive tract. The method recommended for most people is called split dosing. You'll drink a half-gallon of liquid laxative in the evening. Then you'll get up about 6 hours before your appointment to drink another half-gallon. You probably won't enjoy the taste of the solution, but there are tricks to help get it down: Mix it with something flavored, like a sports drink or powdered drink mix. Keep it well chilled. Drink it through a straw placed far back on your tongue. Follow it with a sip of something good tasting. Suck on a lemon slice or piece of hard candy after drinking. Once the laxative starts working, you'll have frequent, forceful diarrhea. You may have cramps and bloating. If you have hemorrhoids, they may become irritated. You may also feel nauseated and even vomit. If so, your doctor may recommend you take a short break. Try these tips to make yourself as comfortable as possible: Stay in the bathroom -- bring something to entertain yourself, like a book, television, or laptop. Apply diaper cream before the diarrhea starts. Use moist or medicated wipes to clean yourself. The purge process may still be happening as you head to your appointment. If you're worried about having an accident, consider wearing adult diapers and pack extra clothes. Your stool should look like urine or clear water if you have completed the process appropriately and it has worked effectively. The process isn't easy, but remind yourself this is a smart step to protect your health. If you prepare well, your doctor will be able to see what he needs, and your colonoscopy will go faster. If your results are good, it may be 10 years before you have to go through it again."
422,"It's important to eat a healthy diet when you have type 1 diabetes. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy tasty food, including some of your favorites. With type 1 diabetes, your body stops making insulin. So you take insulin every day either through shots or a pump. It's also key to track your blood sugar levels. Insulin is only part of the picture. Diet and exercise also play important roles in helping keep your blood sugar levels stable. When you make healthy food choices and eat consistent amounts through the day, it can help control your sugars. It can also lower your chance of diabetes-related problems like heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage. Some experts used to think there was a ""diabetes diet."" They thought people with diabetes had to avoid all foods with sugars or stop eating certain other foods. But when you have type 1, you can eat the same healthy diet as everyone else. Follow some general guidelines: Eat less unhealthy fat. Cut back on the saturated fats you find in high-fat meats like bacon and regular ground beef, as well as full-fat dairy like whole milk and butter. Unhealthy fats raise your chance of heart disease. With diabetes, you face higher-than-average odds of getting heart disease. Make smart food choices to lower that risk. Get enough fiber. It may help control your blood sugar. You can get fiber from whole grains, beans, and fruits and vegetables. Try to get 25-30 grams a day. Those high-fiber foods are always better choices than low-fiber carbs such as refined 'white' grains and processed sugary foods. Carbohydrates are your body's main source of energy. You get them from many foods, like grains (pasta, bread, crackers, and cookies), fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and sugars. Carbs raise your blood sugar levels faster than any food. How many and what type of carbohydrate foods you eat can affect how well you manage your diabetes. Counting carbs helps you keep track of how many carbs you eat. You can work with your doctor or a dietitian to figure out how many grams of carbs you should eat for each meal and snack. You can use the food label, a food exchange app, or other reference to count up the grams of carbs in foods. Some people think sugar ""causes"" diabetes. But type 1 is caused by genetics and other factors. Still, many sweet foods have a lot of carbs, and that can affect your blood sugar. If a food is ""sugar free,"" that doesn't mean it also has fewer carbs or calories. Read the label so you can count how many carbs you're getting. You may want to consider foods and drinks that use low-calorie or artificial sweeteners. They can satisfy your sweet tooth without the extra carbs and calories. The American Diabetes Association suggests you eat these tasty items. They're low in carbs (also known as low glycemic index foods). And they're high in key nutrients like calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and other vitamins. Beans Dark green leafy vegetables Citrus fruit Sweet potatoes Berries Tomatoes Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon) Whole grains Nuts Fat-free yogurt and milk"
423,"Sickle cell disease changes the shape of the oxygen-carrying molecules (called hemoglobin) found inside red blood cells. Red blood cells are usually round and flexible. This allows them to glide smoothly through your bloodstream. But when you have sickle cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin creates stiff, sickle-shaped red blood cells. If you have this disease, these abnormally shaped red blood cells can cause a number of health problems. For example: The cells build up and block blood flow to organs and tissues. The cells die sooner. Sickle cells live about 10 to 20 days. Healthy red blood cells live from 90 to 120 days. Red blood cells may burst open (hemolyze). Even though your body constantly makes new red blood cells to replace the old ones, sickle cell disease may prevent your body from keeping up with the demand. These events trigger the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Usually, they first appear when a child is about five to six months old. Early signs in babies are: Extreme fussiness Painful swelling of the hands and feet due to blockage of blood flow. Your doctor may call this ""dactylitis."" Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (also called jaundice or icterus) With sickle cell disease, you don't have enough healthy red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia. Symptoms can include: Trouble breathing Dizziness and lightheadedness Fast heart rate Fatigue Irritability Pale skin color Delayed growth in infants Delayed puberty in teens Sickle cells can travel to any part of your body, causing damage. If they affect your spleen, you may have frequent infections. If they block the blood vessels in your eyes, you can develop vision problems. Pain is an unpredictable symptom of sickle cell disease. The deformed blood cells can get stuck in and block your blood vessels. When this happens, oxygen-rich blood cannot reach key organs and tissues. The result is a sudden pain attack, called a pain crisis. The pain may feel sharp, stabbing, intense, or throbbing. Some people with sickle cell disease say it's worse than childbirth or the pain after surgery. You may have pain anywhere in your body and in more than one place. The most common areas are: Arms Belly Chest Legs Lower back A pain crisis can last anywhere from hours to weeks. If it's severe, you'll need to seek emergency care at a hospital. The number of pain attacks varies from person to person. Some people have them often. Others have only a few every now and then. Most kids are pain-free between attacks. But many teens and adults have long-term pain. Everyone is different. Some types of the disorder, like sickle cell anemia (also called hemoglobin SS), cause more severe symptoms than other types. Some people have only mild symptoms. Others have repeated flares that and often need to go stay in a hospital. And your experience may change. You'll want to work with your (or your child's) doctor to best understand the disease, what to watch out for, and how best to take care of the condition."
424,"Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips.

Temporal arteritis causes inflammation that damages large and medium-sized arteries. The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Temporal arteritis is also known as ""giant cell arteritis."" Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including: Severe headaches, the most common symptom. Scalp tenderness. Jaw or facial soreness, especially with chewing. Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye. Stroke may occur in less than 5% of patients as a result of decreased blood flow. The large blood vessels may become narrowed (stenosis) or enlarged (aneurysm). If narrowing occurs in the blood vessels leading to the arms or legs, patients may notice fatigue or aching in the limbs, due to a reduced blood supply. Your doctor may notice weak or absent pulses. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, night sweats, depression, fatigue, and a general feeling of being ill. Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect the same types of people. People over age 50 are most often affected. The average age of patients is 70. These diseases are more common among women, and Caucasians are more likely to get these diseases than other ethnic groups. The exact cause of these illnesses is unknown. Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below: Shoulder pain on both sides Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests Reported new hip pain Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica. Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is also tested for temporal arteritis. This, too, would start with the exam and listening to the patient's symptoms. If temporal arteritis is suspected, but less convincing features are present, a temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is taken from a part of the artery located in the hairline, in front of the ear. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis. Yes. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include: Rheumatoid arthritis Infections Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) Chemical and hormonal abnormalities A variety of muscle diseases Cancer There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called ""steroids"" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab ( Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. . This medicine may be used along with steroids The excellent response to treatment is so uniform that the lack of dramatic improvement, within days, would make the diagnosis of temporal arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica doubtful. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them. You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly. Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough, fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor. Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis (bone loss), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D, sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor. With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or are nonresponsive to steroids), The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications."
425,"Throat cancers grow in the organs that help you swallow, speak, and breathe. About half of these cancers happen in the throat itself, the tube that starts behind your nose and ends in your neck. It's also called the ""pharynx."" The rest start in the voice box, or ""larynx."" These diseases tend to grow quickly. That's why getting treated early on gives you the best chance to beat them and keep a good quality of life. Learn as much as you can so you'll know what to expect. You may have: Voice changes like cracking or hoarseness Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat, cough, or earache that won't go away Headache Neck lump Unexplained weight loss See your doctor right away if any symptoms last for more than a few weeks. Using tobacco for a long time. Smoking it and chewing it are the biggest risk factors for all head and neck cancers, including throat cancer. Drinking heavily and regularly. That means more than two drinks of alcohol a day if you're a man or more than one a day if you're a woman. You drive up your risk even more if you drink and you smoke. HPV. Human papillomavirus is linked to cancers in the back of the throat, including tongue and tonsil cancers. You can help protect your kids from it in the future by having your children get the HPV vaccines. Kids should start the series of shots between 11 and 12 years old. Other risk factors include: Gender. Men are five times more likely to get it than women. Age. Most people get diagnosed after 65. Race. African- American men are at the biggest risk. Chemical exposure. This includes being around asbestos, nickel, and sulfuric acid fumes. Most types grow in the flat, thin cells that line the throat and voice box. Doctors identify them by where they are: Nasopharynx. This is the upper part of your throat behind your nose. In the U. S, cancer here is rare. Oropharynx. This part is behind your mouth. Cancer is most likely to grow in the tonsils, the back of the tongue, or the soft palate. Hypopharynx. That's the narrow area behind your voice box. Cancer can grow in the three parts of the voice box itself: Glottis. This holds your vocal cords. Supraglottis. This is the area above the glottis. Subglottis. This is the area below your vocal cords and above your windpipe. Your doctor will examine you and ask about your general health, smoking and drinking habits, and sexual history. He might use devices to get a closer look at your throat. If the doctor thinks you may have cancer, he'll order tests and procedures depending on what kind he suspects. Common ones include: A biopsy collects a tissue sample that gets examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. It's the only way to know for sure if a tumor is cancer and what kind it is. The procedure may be done with surgery, fine needles, or an endoscope -- a flexible tube with a camera that's lowered into the throat through your nose or mouth. A tool on the end will take the biopsy. Imaging tests can help doctors find a tumor. They can also show how big it is and if it has spread. These include: MRI or CT scan PET scan X-rays If cancer of the oropharynx is found, the sample may be tested for HPV. Usually, someone's health outlook is better if their disease tests positive for this virus rather than being smoking-related cancer. Each type of this cancer has its own rules for staging, which describes how severe the disease is. But generally, stages I and II are smaller cancers and remain in one area of the organ. Stage III diseases may have gone to lymph nodes or other parts of the throat. And stage IV cancers may have spread to lymph nodes and different parts of the head, neck, or chest. The most serious stage IV cancers have traveled to distant parts of the body like the lungs or liver. Doctors will try to get rid of the tumor, keep the cancer from spreading, and protect your ability to swallow and speak as much as possible. Your treatment will depend on: The stage of your cancer Where it is Your general health Your preferences You may have one or more treatments: Radiation uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It's given outside your body by a machine, or inside by radioactive seeds planted near the cancer. Sometimes radiation is the only treatment needed for early-stage cancers. But it can be used with chemotherapy or surgery to treat later-stage disease. Surgery may be done through incisions with a scalpel. It may also be less invasive -- going in through the mouth with a tube called an endoscope, or with lasers or robotic techniques. Very early cancers can usually be taken out with endoscopes or lasers. If your cancer is more advanced, parts or all of your larynx or pharynx may need to be removed. This may affect your ability to swallow, breathe, or speak normally. Doctors may use tissue from another spot in your body to rebuild parts of your throat to help you swallow. If your voice box is removed, the surgeon will attach your windpipe to an opening in your neck, called a stoma, so you can breathe. If cancer has spread deep in your neck, your surgeon may do an operation to remove lymph nodes. Chemotherapy drugs can kill cancer and stop it from spreading. It may be used before surgery to shrink tumors, or after to keep the disease from coming back. Some chemo drugs can make radiation work better. Targeted therapy drugs can starve cancer cells by blocking substances they need to grow. Your doctor can prescribe you medication to help you manage pain. You may have problems during or after your treatment. Specialists can: Show you how to care for your stoma Teach you to speak if you have no voice box Come up with ways to make swallowing or eating easier Take care of yourself. Your treatment might take a lot out of you. So get enough rest, exercise when you can, and fill your plate with healthy food, like fruits and veggies. Quit tobacco and limit alcohol. Smoking and drinking can make treatments less effective, and they raise your risk of getting another cancer. Keep your appointments. Your doctor will follow you closely for the first few years. He'll look for signs that the cancer has come back."
426,"Although arthritis treatment usually includes medication, a tailored arthritis exercise program can help relieve pain and fatigue and preserve joint structure and function. The stiffness, pain, and swelling associated with arthritis can severely reduce the range of motion of joints (the distance joints can move in certain directions). Avoiding physical activity because of pain or discomfort also can lead to significant muscle loss and excessive weight gain. Exercise, as part of a comprehensive arthritis treatment plan, can improve joint mobility, muscle strength, and overall physical conditioning, and help you maintain a healthy weight. Once you know what type of arthritis you have and understand your symptoms, you and your doctor or physical therapist can develop a balanced program of physical activity to reduce the damaging effects of arthritis and promote optimal health. A tailored program that includes a balance of three types of exercises -- range-of-motion, strengthening, and endurance -- can relieve the symptoms of arthritis and protect joints from further damage. Exercise also may: Help maintain normal joint movement Increase muscle flexibility and strength Help maintain weight to reduce pressure on joints Help keep bone and cartilage tissue strong and healthy Improve endurance and cardiovascular fitness To help relieve pain, people with arthritis often keep their affected joints bent -- especially those in the knees, hands, and fingers -- because it's more comfortable in that position. Although this may temporarily relieve discomfort, holding a joint in the same position for too long can cause permanent loss of mobility and further hinder the ability to perform daily activities. Range-of-motion exercises (also called stretching or flexibility exercises) help maintain normal joint function by increasing and preserving joint mobility and flexibility. In this group of exercises, gently straightening and bending the joints in a controlled manner as far as they comfortably will go can help condition the affected joints. During the course of a range-of-motion exercise program, the joints are stretched progressively farther until normal or near-normal range is achieved and maintained. This helps to maintain comfort while function is preserved. In addition to preserving joint function, range-of-motion exercises are an important form of warm-up and stretching, and should be done prior to performing strengthening or endurance exercises, or engaging in any other physical activity. A doctor or physical therapist can provide you with instructions on how to perform range-of-motion exercises. Strong muscles help keep weak joints stable and comfortable and protect them against further damage. A program of strengthening exercises that targets specific muscle groups can be helpful as part of your arthritis treatment. There are several types of strengthening exercises that, when performed properly, can maintain or increase muscle tissue to support your muscles without aggravating your joints. Some people with arthritis avoid exercise because of joint pain. However, a group of exercises called ""isometrics"" will help strengthen muscles without bending painful joints. Isometrics involve no joint movement but rather strengthen muscle groups by using an alternating series of isolated muscle flexes and periods of relaxation. Isotonics is another group of exercises that involve joint mobility. However, this group of exercises is more intensive, achieving strength development through increased repetitions or by introducing increasing weight resistance such as with with small dumbbells or stretch bands. A physical therapist or fitness instructor (preferably one who has experience working with people with arthritis) can tell you how to safely and effectively perform isometric and isotonic exercises. Hydrotherapy, also called ""aqua therapy"" (water therapy), is a program of exercises performed in a large pool. Aqua therapy may be easier on joints because the buoyancy of water takes some of the weight off the painful joints while providing resistance training. The foundation of endurance training is aerobic exercise, which includes any activity that increases the heart rate for a prolonged period of time. Aerobic activity conditions the heart and lungs to: Use oxygen to more efficiently supply the entire body with larger amounts of oxygen-rich blood Build stronger muscles for endurance activity When paired with a healthy diet, aerobic activity also is fundamental for controlling weight (which is important for people with arthritis since it reduces excess pressure on affected joints) and for improving overall general health. At first, people with arthritis should perform about 15 to 20 minutes of aerobic activity at least three times a week, and then gradually build up to 30 minutes daily. The activity also should include at least five to 10 minutes of warm-up plus five to 10 minutes of cool-down. Although peak benefits are achieved when an aerobic activity is performed continuously for at least 30 minutes, aerobic exercise can be spread out in smaller segments of time throughout the day to suit your comfort level, without overexerting yourself. Aerobic exercise should be performed at a comfortable, steady pace that allows you to talk normally and easily during the activity. Ask your therapist what intensity of exercise is appropriate for your fitness level. During exercise, your heart's ""training range,"" or target heart rate, should be closely monitored. To improve your body's aerobic condition, you should calculate your maximum heart rate -- 220 minus your age -- and exercise at a level of intensity between 60% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. Examples of aerobic activities include walking, swimming, low-impact aerobic dance, skiing, and biking, and may even include such daily activities as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, or playing golf. Walking is one of the easiest aerobic exercises to begin because it requires no special skills or equipment other than a good pair of supportive walking shoes, and it's less stressful on joints than running or jogging. Biking is another good choice for people with arthritis, because it places less stress on knee, foot, and ankle joints. Swimming is also often recommended because there is minimal pressure on joints while in water. Appropriate recreational exercise, including sports, can be helpful to most people with arthritis. These activities are best preceded by a program of range-of-motion and strength exercises to reduce the chance of injury. Regardless of your condition, discuss exercise options with a doctor before beginning any new exercise program. People with arthritis who are beginning a new exercise program should spend some time conditioning with a program that consists of only range-of-motion and strengthening exercises, depending on their physical condition and level of fitness. Endurance exercises should be added gradually, and only after you feel comfortable with your current fitness level. As with any change in lifestyle, your body will need time to adapt to your new program. During the first few weeks, you may notice changes in the way your muscles feel, your sleep patterns, or energy levels. These changes are to be expected with increased activity. However, improper exercise levels or programs may be harmful, making symptoms of arthritis worse. Check with your doctor and adjust your program if you experience any of the following: Unusual or persistent fatigue Sharp or increased pain Increased weakness Decreased range of motion Increased joint swelling Continuing pain Regardless of the exercise program you select, it's important to begin slowly and choose a program you enjoy so that you maintain it. Make exercise part of your daily routine so that it becomes a lifetime habit."
427,"Birth control, like sterilization, is a way for men and women to prevent pregnancy. There are many different methods of birth control; some types also protect against sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs. Sterilization is a permanent form of birth control that is extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. But it is difficult to reverse if you change your mind, and it does not protect against STDs. Both men and women can be sterilized. For women, a tubal ligation is performed; for men, a vasectomy is performed. Tubal ligation is performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical clinic while you are anesthetized (put to sleep). One or two small incisions (cuts) are made in the abdomen, and a device similar to a small telescope (called a laparoscope) is inserted. The fallopian tubes are cut, tied, clamped, banded or sealed shut. The skin incisions are then stitched closed. The patient is able to return home within a few hours after the procedure. Tubal ligation can also be performed immediately after childbirth through a small incision near the navel or during a cesarean delivery. An estimated 700,000 American women undergo tubal ligation each year, making it the most common form of contraception in the U. S. Tubal ligation is performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical clinic while you are anesthetized (put to sleep). One or two small incisions (cuts) are made in the abdomen, and a device similar to a small telescope (called a laparoscope) is inserted. Using instruments that are inserted through the laparoscope, the fallopian tubes are cut, tied, clamped, banded or sealed shut. The skin incisions are then stitched closed. The patient is able to return home within a few hours after the procedure. Tubal ligation can also be performed immediately after childbirth through a small incision near the navel or during a cesarean delivery. Tubal ligation and tubal implants are not 100% effective at preventing pregnancy. There is a slight risk of becoming pregnant after tubal ligation. No. Sterilization does not protect against STDs, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Male condoms provide the best protection from most STDs. A vasectomy, or male sterilization, is a simple, permanent sterilization procedure for men. It's generally safer and less painful than sterilization in women. The operation, usually done in a doctor's office, requires cutting and sealing or blocking the vas deferens, the tubes in the male reproductive system that carry sperm. A vasectomy prevents the transport of sperm out of the testes. This surgery does not affect the man's ability to achieve orgasm or ejaculate. There will still be a fluid ejaculate, but there will be no sperm in the fluid. Except in rare cases, this procedure is nearly 100% effective. No. Vasectomy does not protect against STDs, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Male condoms provide the best protection from most STDs. A vasectomy is usually done in the surgeon's office while the man is awake, but is relatively pain-free since local anesthesia is used. A small incision is made in the upper part of the scrotum, under the penis. The tubes (vas deferens) that carry sperm are tied off and cut apart, burned or blocked with surgical clips. The skin incision is stitched closed. The patient is able to return home immediately. There is a non-surgical technique that some doctors use. In a ""no-scalpel"" vasectomy, the doctor feels for the vas deferens under the skin of the scrotum and holds it in place with a small clamp. Then a special instrument is used to make a tiny puncture in the skin and stretch the opening so the vas deferens can be cut and tied. No stitches are needed to close the punctures, which heal quickly by themselves. After a vasectomy, you will probably feel sore for a few days. You should rest for at least one day. However, you can expect to recover completely in less than a week. Many men have the procedure on a Friday and return to work on Monday. Although vasectomy complications such as swelling, bruising, inflammation, and infection may occur, they are relatively uncommon and almost never serious. Nevertheless, men who develop these symptoms at any time should inform their doctor. You can resume sexual activity within a few days after a vasectomy, but birth control should be used until a test shows that your semen is free of sperm. Generally, this test is performed after you have had 10-20 post-vasectomy ejaculations. If sperm are still present in the semen, you will be asked to return at a later date for a repeat test. Once sperm are absent from the ejaculate, other forms of contraception may be discontinued. The chance of pregnancy, however, is not zero. Due to a process known as spontaneous recanalization (tubes rejoining), pregnancies may occur after vasectomy, although this is very rare. The chief disadvantage of a vasectomy is its permanence, although this is also considered the chief advantage. The procedure itself is simple, but reversing it is difficult, expensive, and can be unsuccessful. But, it is possible to store semen in a sperm bank to preserve the possibility of producing a pregnancy at some future date. However, doing this is costly, and the sperm in stored semen do not always remain viable (able to cause pregnancy). For all of these reasons, doctors advise that a vasectomy be undertaken only by men who are prepared to accept the fact that they will no longer be able to father a child. The decision should be considered along with other contraceptive options and discussed with a professional counselor. Men who are married or in a serious relationship should also discuss the issue with their partners. Although it is extremely effective for preventing pregnancy, a vasectomy does not offer protection against AIDS or other STDs. Consequently, it is important that vasectomized men continue to use condoms, preferably latex, which offer considerable protection against the spread of disease. Another disadvantage is the immune reactions to sperm that some men develop after a vasectomy, although current evidence indicates that these reactions do not cause any harm. No. A vasectomy does not affect the production or release of testosterone, the male hormone responsible for a man's sex drive, beard, deep voice, and other masculine traits. The operation also has no effect on sexuality. Erections, climaxes, and the amount of ejaculate remain the same. Occasionally, a man may experience sexual difficulties after a vasectomy, but these almost always have an emotional basis and usually can be alleviated with counseling. More often, men who have undergone the procedure, and their partners, find that sex is more spontaneous and enjoyable once they are freed from concerns about accidental pregnancy. Some research studies have led to questions about the link between vasectomies and prostate cancer. The most current research shows that a vasectomy does not increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer and that this concern should not be a reason to avoid having one."
428,"Traveler's diarrhea is an intestinal infection that occurs as a result of eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Food handlers who do not wash their hands after they use the bathroom can transmit the infection to people who consume the contaminated food. Areas where there is the highest risk of contracting traveler's diarrhea include the developing countries of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. The risk of infection varies depending on the type of exposure -- from a fairly low risk from eating hot, cooked foods and drinking factory-sealed beverages to a higher risk from eating raw vegetables and fruits and drinking tap water. The most common culprit is a bacteria called E.coli. The typical symptoms of traveler's diarrhea include: Abrupt onset of diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Bloating Urgent need to have a bowel movement Malaise (weakness or discomfort) Explosive and painful gas Cramps Loss of appetite Traveler's diarrhea usually lasts from 3 to 7 days and is rarely life threatening. As with all diseases, it is best to consult a doctor rather than attempting to self-medicate for traveler's diarrhea. This is especially relevant for pregnant women and children. Pepto- Bismol (2 ounces four times daily or two tablets four times daily) decreases the diarrhea and shortens the duration of the illness. This medication also appears to be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea, but it should not be taken for more than three weeks at a time. Side effects of Pepto- Bismol can include temporary blackening of tongue and stools, occasional nausea, constipation, and rarely, ringing in the ears. Do not take Pepto- Bismol if you have an aspirin allergy, renal insufficiency, gout, or if you are taking anticoagulants, probenecid ( Benemid, Probalan), or methotrexate ( Rheumatrex). The most important treatment requires the replacement of fluids and salts lost from diarrhea. This is best achieved by use of an oral rehydration solution such as the World Health Organization oral rehydration salts ( ORS) solution. ORS packets are available at stores or pharmacies in almost all developing countries. ORS is prepared by adding one packet to boiled or treated water. Packet instructions should be followed carefully to ensure that the salts are added to the correct volume of water. ORS solution should be consumed or discarded within 12 hours if stored at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated. An antidiarrheal medication, such as Lomotil or Imodium, can decrease the number of diarrheal stools but can also cause complications for people with serious infections. These drugs should not be used by anyone with a high fever or blood in their stools. Antibiotics such as cirpofloxacin ( Cipro), norfloxacin ( Noroxin), rifamycin ( Amecolo), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( Bactrim, Septra), and or may shorten the length of illness. The CDC does not recommend the use of most antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, with the exception of azithromycin ( Zithromax), because they can sometimes cause additional problems. Azithromycin is specificately used to treat traveler's diarrhea. Consult your doctor about taking these medications. It is important for an infected person to consult a doctor about treating diarrhea in children and infants, because some of the drugs mentioned above are not recommended for children. The greatest risk for children, especially infants, is dehydration. Again, the best treatment for dehydration is the ORS solution. Breastfed infants should continue nursing on demand. For bottle-fed infants, full-strength lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas should be used. Be sure to mix the formula with boiled water that has cooled. Older children receiving semisolid or solid foods should continue to receive usual foods if they have diarrhea. Immediate medical attention is required if an infant with diarrhea develops signs of moderate to severe dehydration (including dry mouth, eyes, and skin), confusion; sunken eyes; and fever, bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 F. Seek medical help for traveler's diarrhea if: Diarrhea is severe, bloody, or does not resolve within a few days Diarrhea is accompanied by fever and chills You are unable to keep fluids down to prevent dehydration In areas with poor sanitation, only the following beverages may be safe to drink: boiled water, hot beverages (such as coffee or tea) made with boiled water, canned or bottled carbonated beverages, beer, and wine. Avoid ice, as it may have been made from contaminated water. It is safer to drink from an unopened can or bottle than from a container that is not known to be clean and dry. Water on the surface of a beverage can or bottle may also be contaminated. Therefore, the area of a can or bottle that will touch the mouth should be wiped clean and dried. Where water may be contaminated, you should not brush your teeth with tap water. Boiling is the most reliable method to make water safe to drink. Bring water to a vigorous boil, then allow it to cool; do not add ice. At high altitudes, allow water to boil vigorously for a few minutes or use chemical disinfectants. Chemical disinfection can be achieved with either iodine or chlorine. Iodine usually provides greater disinfection. For disinfection with iodine, use either tincture of iodine or tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, such as Globaline or Potable- Aqua. These disinfectants can be found in sporting goods stores and pharmacies. Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions. If the water is cloudy, strain it through a clean cloth and double the number of disinfectant tablets added. If the water is very cold, either warm it or allow increased time for the disinfectant to work. Adding a pinch of salt or pouring water from one container to another will improve the taste. Portable water filters are not recommended due to lack of independently verified results of the filters' effectiveness. As a last resort, if no source of safe drinking water is available, tap water that is uncomfortably hot to the touch may be safer than cold tap water. However, many disease-causing organisms can survive the usual temperature reached by the hot water in overseas hotels and boiling or proper disinfection is still advised. Food should be selected with care. Foods you should avoid include: Salads Uncooked vegetables and fruit. If you peel fruit yourself, it is generally safe. Unpasteurized milk and dairy products Raw meat and shellfish Food that has been cooked and is still hot is usually safe. Some fish is not guaranteed to be safe, even when cooked, because of the presence of toxins in its flesh. Tropical reef fish, red snapper, amberjack, grouper, and sea bass can occasionally be toxic at unpredictable times if they are caught on tropical reefs rather than in the open ocean. The barracuda and puffer fish are often toxic and should generally not be eaten. Seafood from the islands of the West Indies and the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans should be avoided, as it is more likely to contain toxins."
429,"About 157 million workdays are lost each year in the U. S. due to migraine. Nine out of 10 people with it say they ""can't function normally"" on days that they strike. About one-third of them say they have to go to bed when that happens. But when a migraine starts in the office, going to bed isn't an option. There are things that can help you avoid a migraine while you're on the job. Still, you should have a plan in case one hits. Your workplace may be full of things that can set off migraines. To make life easier in the office, try to figure out which things bring your pain. A headache diary can help you look for patterns. Keep track of what was happening when your migraines started and what you think set them off. Common triggers include: Lighting: Bright, flickering, or fluorescent lights can bring migraines to some people. So can glaring computer screens. Smells: You may get a migraine when faced with strong odors like perfumes, secondhand smoke, or cleaners. Different smells can affect people with migraine. Even a whiff of someone's lunch in the microwave can be a trigger. Noise: For some, loud sounds or too much noise can bring a migraine. Travel: Heading out of town for work can bring the pain. It can happen because you change how you sleep and eat when you're on the road. Stress: Many people have lots of pressure on the job. Migraines are most likely to happen when you're stressed. If you know what's likely to trigger a migraine at work, try to stay away from them: Turn off fluorescent lights, or ask to have ones that flicker fixed. Use an anti-glare screen for your computer. Use headphones if your workspace is noisy, or ask to move to a quieter area. If people around you use fragrances, ask about a no-scent policy. If kitchen smells bother you, see if you can be moved away from areas with food. If cleaning smells bother you, ask your office to switch to odor-free products. Take regular breaks for fresh air. Find stress relievers, like relaxing music or deep breathing exercises. Don't skip meals. Hunger can bring a migraine. Be ready in case a migraine hits. Keep medicine with you, and take it as soon as you feel one coming on. When traveling, make sure it's always within arm's reach. Have a heat pack or cold pack on hand, if those help. Find a dark, quiet place to go when you need some privacy, like a break room or other little-used space. It may be a good idea to talk to your boss or HR department, especially if the pain affects how you do your job. Migraines can be a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The legislation makes it illegal for your boss to discriminate against you because of your condition. Whether you qualify for protection under the act depends on how much your migraine affects your ability to do your job. You can work with your boss or human resources department to come up with ways to make it easier to do your job. They may be able to make some changes in your workspace. You may also want to tell them that you may have to come in late, leave early, or work from home if a migraine strikes."
430,"If it's temporary and only happens occasionally, problems getting or keeping an erection aren't cause for concern. There could be any number of reasons. It could be fatigue, stress, drinking alcohol, or even side effects of a medicine you just started taking. But some men have a more frequent, longer lasting problem called erectile dysfunction ( ED). It's more common in older men, but aging isn't the cause. In nearly 75% of ED cases, there's a physical cause. That means it's time to see your doctor. There are three main reasons you shouldn't try to deal with erectile dysfunction on your own: It can be treated: Sometimes, it's as simple as taking a pill your doctor prescribes. There are drugs just for ED. Other options your doctor can help you explore include: Injections Suppositories Surgical penile implants Special devices, like vacuum pumps, which boost blood flow to the penis It can be linked to more serious health conditions like: High blood pressure Hardening of the arteries Diabetes It can also be linked to other medical treatments, such as: Prostate surgery Radiation therapy If your doctor can find the cause, treating that may also help you in the bedroom. If stress, anxiety, or depression is causing it, your doctor can help you find a licensed mental health professional to talk with. The first thing to do is to make an appointment. If you don't want to tell the receptionist why you're coming in, just say you want to talk to the doctor about a male health problem. Next, make a list of information your doctor will want. It should include: All medications you take, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, supplements, and vitamins. Facts about your symptoms. When did they start? Did they come on slow or fast? Does it happen every time you want to have sex? Is it random? Is it only under certain circumstances? Key personal information. Are you going through a stressful time? Have there been any major changes at home or work? Are you drinking heavily, or using cocaine, cigarettes, or opioids? Think about asking your partner to come along. Your partner can fill in details that you may forget or may not have thought of. You'll want answers to these questions before you leave: What's causing my ED? Are my symptoms long-term or temporary? Can my ED be treated? What are the treatment options? What if they don't work? Will I need to see a specialist? What will my insurance cover? Can I make lifestyle changes that will help? Where I can get more information? Worried about discussing your problem? The best approach is just to say, "" I think I may have ED."" It's unlikely your doctor will feel uncomfortable. If he has trouble talking about sexual issues with you, ask him to refer you to a urologist. The doctor will start by asking about your medical history. He'll do this to learn more about your symptoms, conditions, and what medicines you're taking. The questions may seem personal. But it's important to answer them fully and honestly. The doctor needs this information to know how to treat you. The questions may include: Do you ever get an erection? If you do, is it firm enough to have sex? If you do start to have sex, do you then lose the erection? Does it ever come back? Can you get an erection by masturbation? Do you ever wake up with an erection? The doctor will ask if you smoke, how much alcohol you drink, and whether or not you use recreational drugs. Then he'll do a physical exam. This will include your penis and prostate. The doctor may also do blood and other lab tests to check for things like diabetes or heart disease. If you need more tests, he may send you to an urologist. When you see the urologist, ask the same questions you asked your doctor. Expect him to ask questions close to the ones your doctor asked you. The urologist will ask what happens when you have sex. This will help him know where to start. He'll use your answers to track your progress. He'll ask more questions about your health and give you a physical exam. You may have to have more blood work or an ultrasound. It may feel awkward at first to talk with your doctor about ED. But starting the conversation is well worth it."
431,"Despite its name, heartburn has nothing to do with the heart (although some of the symptoms are similar to a heart attack). Heartburn, also called acid indigestion, is an irritation of the esophagus caused by acid that refluxes (comes back up) from the stomach. When swallowing, food passes down the throat and through the esophagus to the stomach. Normally, a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter ( LES) opens to allow food into the stomach (or to permit belching); then it closes again. Next, the stomach releases strong acids to help break down the food. But if the lower esophageal sphincter opens too often or does not close tight enough, stomach acid can reflux, or seep back into the esophagus, causing the burning sensation we know as heartburn. Not only can stomach acid in the esophagus cause heartburn, but it sometimes causes damage to the esophagus in the form of esophagitis, ulcers, difficulty or pain when swallowing, strictures (narrowing), esophageal spasm, and c Barretts esophagus which may increase the chance of cancer of the esophagus. Most people have felt heartburn at one time or another. In fact, the American Gastroenterological Association reports that more than 60 million Americans experience heartburn/reflux symptoms at least once each month. Though uncomfortable, heartburn does not usually present a serious health problem for most people. However, if heartburn symptoms occur frequently and persistently, they can be an indicator of a more serious problem, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Left untreated, GERD can cause a host of complications, including cancer. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a relatively common condition that affects from up to 20% of the population. It is a chronic reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus. GERD manifests itself as several symptoms including heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty swallowing. Thus, if heartburn symptoms occur frequently and persistently, they are most likely caused by GERD. The severity of GERD depends on lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, as well as the type and amount of fluid brought up from the stomach. Treatments aim to reduce the amount of reflux or reduce the potential for damage to the esophageal lining from refluxed substances. In addition, doctors recommend lifestyle and dietary modification to lessen acid reflux. Various lifestyle and dietary factors can contribute to heartburn by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter and allowing it to open, increasing the amount of acid in the stomach, increasing stomach pressure, or by making the esophagus more sensitive to harsh acids. These factors include: Dietary Habits Eating large portions Eating certain foods, including onions, chocolate, peppermint, high-fat or spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and tomatoes or tomato-based products Drinking certain beverages, including citrus juices, alcohol, and caffeinated and carbonated drinks Eating before bedtime Lifestyle Habits Being overweight Smoking Wearing tight-fitting clothing or belts Lying down or bending over, especially after eating Medical Causes Pregnancy Bulging of the stomach into the chest cavity, also called hiatal hernia GERD Ulcers Certain bacteria Taking certain medications, especially some antibiotics, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aleve or Advil"
432,"An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that records the electrical signals of the brain. Doctors use it to help diagnose epilepsy and sleep disorders. Let your doctor know about any medications -- both prescription and over-the-counter -- and supplements you're taking. Wash your hair the night before the test. Don't use any leave-in conditioning or styling products afterward. If you are wearing extensions that use glue, they should be removed. You lie down on the exam table or bed, and a technician puts about 20 small sensors on your scalp. These sensors, called electrodes, pick up electrical activity from cells inside your brain called neurons and send them to a machine, where they show up as a series of lines recorded on moving paper or displayed on a computer screen. You'll relax with your eyes open first, then with them closed. The technician may ask you to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light, because both of these can change your brain wave patterns. The machine is only recording the activity of the brain and does not stimulate it. It's rare to have a seizure during the test. You can have an EEG at night while you're asleep. If other body functions, such as your breathing and pulse, are also being recorded, the test is called polysomnography ( PSG). In some cases, you may be sent home with an EEG device which will either send the data directly back to your doctor's office, or record it for later analysis. The technician will take the electrodes off and wash off the glue that held them in place. You can use a little fingernail polish remover at home to get rid of any leftover stickiness. Unless you're actively having seizures or your doctor says you shouldn't, you can drive home. But if the EEG was done overnight, it's better to have someone else drive you. You can usually start taking medications you'd stopped specifically for the test. A neurologist, a doctor who specializes in the brain, will look at the recording of your brain wave pattern."
433,"You know the main symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases. But did you know that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis -- both of which are IBDs -- can trigger problems elsewhere in your body? They can show up before you even know you have an IBD, or not until years after your diagnosis. Many of these issues go away when you get your irritable bowel disease under control. That's because treating the inflammation that goes along with an IBD can help manage it in other parts of your body, too. Other conditions are more serious, and you may need extra treatment. Your meds might be to blame, or they could crop up because your body can't absorb nutrients from your foods during a flare-up. The type of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis you have can also make you more likely to have problems outside your digestive tract. These âextra-intestinalâ symptoms, as doctors like to call them, can affect many areas of your body, including your joints, mouth, eyes, skin, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and pancreas. Even osteoporosis has been linked to IBDs. You can have one of these extra symptoms or several. They're more common if your parents or siblings have an irritable bowel disease and have extra-intestinal problems related to IBD. Here's how conditions like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis can affect other parts of your body. Joint pain is the most common non-gut ailment for people with IBD. It can affect your large joints like your ankles, hips, or knees, or small ones like your fingers. Although you might notice symptoms as long as a decade before you're diagnosed, this type of arthritis usually doesn't damage your joints. It should go away once you get your disease under control. Talk to your doctor before you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) for joint pain. They can make your IBD worse. Another less-common type affects your spine (ankylosing spondylitis) or lower back (sacroiliitis). It's more common in men than women. You might get raised, painful lumps under your skin, usually on your lower legs. You might hear your doctor call them erythema nodosum. They'll probably show up at the same time as your IBD flares. They, too, will go away -- without leaving scars -- when you get a handle on the disease. Less common but more serious are ulcers that can range from a small spot to the length of your leg. The more serious your IBD symptoms are, the more likely you are to get them. Doctors treat them with high-powered meds that target your immune system. If you have Crohn's disease, you might also get lesions inside your mouth. Antiseptic mouthwash and topical steroids can help. If you're over 40 and you have joint pain with your IBD, you might also have problems with your eyes. The most common is episcleritis. Mild symptoms include redness, burning, and sensitivity. They'll go away as you treat your irritable bowel disease. More-painful eye conditions include uveitis, an inflammation in the middle part of your eye, and scleritis, which affects the white of it. It can cause vision loss if you don't get it treated. There are a couple of reasons people with IBD get osteoporosis. Medications, like steroids, not enough physical activity, and trouble absorbing vitamin D and minerals such as calcium and magnesium all play a role. You're also more likely to break a bone than the people without an irritable bowel disease. This risk goes up as you age. Usually, women are at greater risk for osteoporosis. But IBD-related osteoporosis affects men and women in equal numbers. Calcium and vitamin supplements can help keep your bones healthy, along with exercise, avoiding alcohol, and not smoking. Other potential problems include: Anemia Gallstones and kidney stones Inflamed liver Inflamed or scarred bile ducts, especially if you have ulcerative colitis Delayed growth or puberty in children and teens Your doctor will help you spot these problems. He may refer you to a specialist, like a rheumatologist for your joints, a dermatologist for your skin, or an ophthalmologist for your eyes, depending on how bad your symptoms are. Eat well, drink plenty of liquids, and take supplements if your doctor says you need them to replace vitamins and minerals that your body loses during flare-ups. Smoking raises the chances that you'll have extra symptoms, so work with your doctor or another health professional to help you stop."
434,"It's the stuff movies are made of: After a blow to the head, a person wanders aimlessly, unable to remember who he is or where he came from. While such sudden, profound loss of memory is rare, memory loss is a problem that affects most people, to a degree. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Whether it's occasional forgetfulness or loss of short-term memory that interferes with daily life, there are many causes of memory loss. Here are some of the more common things that can cause memory loss: Medications. A number of prescription and over-the-counter medications can interfere with or cause loss of memory. Possible culprits include: antidepressants, antihistamines, anti-anxiety medications, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, and pain medications given after surgery. Alcohol, tobacco, or drug use. Excessive alcohol use has long been recognized as a cause of memory loss. Smoking harms memory by reducing the amount of oxygen that gets to the brain. Studies have shown that people who smoke find it more difficult to put faces with names than do nonsmokers. Illicit drugs can change chemicals in the brain that can make it hard to recall memories. Sleep deprivation. Both quantity and quality of sleep are important to memory. Getting too little sleep or waking frequently in the night can lead to fatigue, which interferes with the ability to consolidate and retrieve information. Depression and stress. Being depressed can make it difficult to pay attention and focus, which can affect memory. Stress and anxiety can also get in the way of concentration. When you are tense and your mind is overstimulated or distracted, your ability to remember can suffer. Stress caused by an emotional trauma can also lead to memory loss. Nutritional deficiency. Good nutrition -- including high-quality proteins and fats -- is important to proper brain function. Deficiencies in vitamin B1 and B12 specifically can affect memory. Head injury. A severe hit to the head -- from a fall or automobile accident, for example -- can injure the brain and cause both short- and long-term memory loss. Memory may gradually improve over time. Stroke. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is stopped due to the blockage of a blood vessel to the brain or leakage of a vessel into the brain. Strokes often cause short-term memory loss. A person who has had a stroke may have vivid memories of childhood events but be unable to recall what he or she had for lunch. Dementia. Dementia is the name for progressive loss of memory and other aspects of thinking that are severe enough to interfere with the ability to function in daily activities. Although there are many causes of dementia -- including blood vessel disease, drug or alcohol abuse, or other causes of damage to the brain -- the most common and familiar is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a progressive loss of brain cells and other irregularities of the brain. Other causes. Other possible causes of memory loss include an underactive or overactive thyroid gland and infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, and syphilis that affect the brain. If you find that you are increasingly forgetful or if memory problems interfere with your daily life, schedule an appointment with your doctor to determine the cause and best treatment. To evaluate memory loss, your doctor will take a medical history, perform a physical exam -- including a neurologic exam -- and ask questions to test mental ability. Depending on the results, further evaluation may include blood and urine tests, nerve tests, and imaging tests of the brain such as computerized axial tomography ( CAT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Treatment for memory loss depends on the cause. In many cases, it may be reversible with treatment. For example, memory loss from medications may resolve with a change in medication. Nutritional supplements can be useful against memory loss caused by a nutritional deficiency. And treating depression may be helpful for memory when depression is a factor. In some cases -- such as following a stroke -- therapy may help people remember how to do certain tasks such as walking or tying shoes. In others, memory may improve over time. Treatments may also be specific to conditions related to memory loss. For example, drugs are available to treat memory problems related to Alzheimer's disease, and drugs to help lower blood pressure can help reduce risk of more brain damage from dementia related to high blood pressure."
435,"If you have angina -- chest pain that happens when the arteries to your heart are blocked or narrowed -- your doctor may prescribe medicines called nitrates. They relax your arteries so blood can flow more easily to your ticker. Your doctor may also suggest you use nitrates along with another blood pressure drug (hydralazine) to treat congestive heart failure. Some nitrates include: Dilatrate- SR, Iso- Bid, Isonate, Isorbid, Isordil, Isotrate, Sorbitrate (isosorbide dinitrate) Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate) Bi Dil (hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate) Follow the label directions on when and how to take them. It's OK to take these drugs with or without meals. Sometimes, ""medication tolerance"" can set in, which means they don't work as well anymore. Keep up with your appointments so your doctor can monitor how well you respond to the drug. Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand how to take these medications during the day. The number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and how long you need to take them depend on your condition. While you're using nitrates, get your blood pressure checked regularly. Nitrates may make you feel dizzy. You may also get a rapid, irregular, or pounding heartbeat when you take the drugs regularly. It usually gets better after the first few weeks. If it keeps up, talk to your doctor. Some other side effects are: Headache Flushing of your face or neck. Call your doctor if it persists or is severe. Low blood pressure. You shouldn't take nitrates if you: Had severe allergic reactions to medicines with nitroglycerin or isosorbide Take some erectile dysfunction drugs such as Cialis (tadalafil), Levitra (vardenafil), or Viagra (sildenafil). Have narrow-angle glaucoma"
436,"Are you considering gastric sleeve surgery because you've tried diets and exercise for years and still have a lot of weight to lose? You'll want to know the risks and benefits, what makes someone a good candidate for the operation, and what long-term commitments you need to make to keep the results. In this operation, surgeons remove part of your stomach and join the remaining portions together to make a new banana-sized stomach or ""sleeve."" With just a small sack (about 1/10th the size of your original stomach), you'll feel full a lot quicker than you did before. You won't be able to eat as much as you used to, which helps you lose weight. Plus, the surgery removes the part of your stomach that makes a hormone that boosts your appetite. In gastric bypass, the surgeon makes a small pouch that skips most of your stomach, going straight to the intestine. Gastric sleeve surgery is best for people who have a BMI (body mass index) of at least 40. That means you're 100 pounds or more over your ideal weight. Some people are too heavy for gastric bypass surgery, so it may be a good alternative. The surgery takes about an hour. Your surgeon will make a few small cuts in your belly and insert a laparoscope -- an instrument with a tiny camera that sends pictures to a monitor. The surgeon will then insert other medical instruments through the additional cuts and remove 3/4 of your stomach. Finally, he'll reattach the rest of your stomach to form the ""sleeve"" or tube. You might be in hospital about 2 or 3 days. The procedure is permanent. The first day after surgery, you'll drink clear liquids. By the time you leave the hospital, you can eat pureed foods and protein shakes and will continue to do so for about 4 weeks. Keep in mind that you have to change the way you eat forever. After that first month, you'll switch to eating soft solid foods very slowly. Other pointers to keep in mind: Everything must be chewed thoroughly before being swallowed. Don't drink while you eat, as this might cause your new stomach to overfill. Drink liquids a half-hour after finishing a meal. Avoid high-calorie sodas and snacking. Take vitamin and mineral supplements every day. After 2 or 3 months, you can move on to regular meals. But remember, you will not be able to eat as much as you used to. People generally lose 60% of their extra weight over 12 to 18 months. So if you are 100 pounds overweight, you'll lose about 60 pounds, though some lose more and others less. Of course, exercising and eating right add to your weight loss. Infection, bleeding, and in rare cases, a leak along the staple line are possible. Right after the surgery, you may have nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Certain foods may not agree with you now. You may also develop nutrition problems after surgery, which is why you have to take vitamins and supplements for life. Your doctor will advise you on exactly what you need."
437,"Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that stores bile, the fluid that helps digest food. If it's not working the way it should (or your bile gets out of balance), hard fragments start to form. These can be as small as a grain of rice or as big as a golf ball. Gallstones don't go away on their own. If they start to hurt or cause other symptoms, your doctor may decide to remove your gallbladder. This type of surgery is called a cholecystectomy. It's one of the most common surgeries doctors perform. About 80% of people who have gallstones will need surgery. Doctors can remove your gallbladder in one of two ways: Open surgery: During this procedure, your surgeon will make a 5- to 7-inch incision (cut) on your belly to take out your gallbladder. You'll need open surgery if you have a bleeding disorder. You may also need it if you have severe gallbladder disease, are very overweight, or are in your last trimester of pregnancy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Doctors also call this âkeyhole surgery.â Your surgeon doesn't make a big opening in your belly. Instead, he makes four small cuts. He inserts a very thin, flexible tube that contains a light and a tiny video camera into your belly. These help your surgeon see your gallbladder better. Next, he'll insert special tools to remove the diseased organ. For both types of surgery, you'll be given general anesthesia. This means you'll sleep through the procedure and won't feel any pain while it's being done. If your gallstones aren't causing symptoms, there's no need for you to have surgery. You'll only need it if a stone goes into, or blocks, one of your bile ducts. This causes what doctors call a âgallbladder attack.â It's an intense, knife-like pain in your belly that can last several hours. If left untreated, gallstones can also lead to more serious problems, like: Cholecystitis -- an inflamed gallbladder Pancreatitis -- an inflamed pancreas Cholangitis -- inflamed bile ducts Before your doctor opts for surgery, he'll run several tests to see the effect your gallstones are having on your health. Tests might include: Blood test Ultrasound MRI HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan -- a radioactive chemical is put into your body to create images of any blocked ducts Endoscopic ultrasonography -- an imaging device is put into your mouth and down through your digestive tract so sound waves can create a detailed picture of your small intestine You may be able to manage your symptoms for a short time by making changes to your diet. This includes cutting back on fatty foods. But dietary changes don't always help prevent gallbladder attacks. If surgery isn't an option for you, your doctor can prescribe a medication to dissolve your gallstones. But this can take months or even years to work. And even if your gallstones do go away, there's a chance they'll return. You can live without your gallbladder. Your liver can make enough bile on its own. This will naturally find its way into your small intestine even if your gallbladder is removed. Doctors believe gallbladder surgery is safe, but some problems can still arise. These may include: Problems with anesthesia Infection Bleeding Swelling Bile leakage Damage to a bile duct Damage to your intestine, bowel, or blood vessels Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) Heart problems Pneumonia You also run the risk of a problem doctors call âpost-cholecystectomy syndromeâ ( PCS). It can happen if any gallstones are left in your bile ducts or bile happens to leak into your stomach. The symptoms of PCS are similar to those of gallstones. They include belly pain, heartburn, and diarrhea. The length of time it takes you to heal depends on the type of surgery you have. If you have your gallbladder removed during open surgery, you'll need to stay in the hospital for a few days afterward. It may take between 6 to 8 weeks for your body to heal fully. Laparoscopy is less involved, so you'll have less pain and heal faster than if you have open surgery. Most people who have it are able to go home from the hospital the same day. You'll likely be back to your normal routine within 2 weeks."
438,"If you’re a cat owner, you adore your feline even when she makes a little accident. Knowing it’s inevitable and being prepared can make cleanup a breeze. Cat Mess No. 1 -- Urine Sprays and Stains Cats don't always aim straight for the litter box. When your cat leaves a ""present"" on the carpet, he could be spraying to mark his territory or objecting to the litter box’s location or cleanliness. Whatever your cat's reason for peeing on the carpet, it's going to stink if you don't clean it up quickly. Cats can sniff out areas they've marked and target them again. Blot up as much urine as you can with paper towels. Don't use any ammonia-based cleaning products. They smell like cat pee, which may entice kitty to re-mark the spot. Soak the area with carpet cleaner or a few drops of dish detergent mixed with water. Let it sit for 1 to 2 hours. Rinse with a wet sponge. The next day, spray the area with an enzymatic cleaner such as A. O. E. ( Animal Odor Eliminator), Elim- Odor Feline, or F. O. N. ( Feline Odor Neutralizer). Keep your cat away until the area dries. To stop your cat from spraying, try a pheromone product. It smells like your cat's natural scent. One whiff, and he'll have no reason to mark his territory again. Cat Mess No. 2 -- Poop Cat poop may be smellier than urine, but it's easier to get off your floor. Wear gloves. Cat feces may contain a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that's especially dangerous to pregnant women. If you're pregnant, let your partner clean up the mess. Pick up the poop with paper towels. Throw it out in the same place you toss your litter box scoopings. Rinse the area with cool water and blot dry. Apply an enzyme-based pet stain-and-odor remover. Cat Mess No. 3 -- Vomit Like humans, cats vomit. Unlike humans, they don't do it in the toilet. Try to clean the mess before it sets to avoid odors and stubborn stains. If the vomit is solid, pick it up with a paper towel. Then scrub the area with a pet-safe deodorizing cleaner. If the vomit is loose, scrape it into one pile with a plastic spoon. Blot the area with paper towels. Then use a deodorizer or pet stain-and-odor remover. You may need to clean stubborn stains or odors more than once. Cat Mess No. 4 -- Fur Whether their hair is long or short, cats shed--especially in the spring and fall. Brush your long-hair cat several times a week to remove loose hairs so they don't end up on your couch. Your short-hair cat may need to be groomed less frequently. Vacuum carpets, upholstery, and anywhere else hairballs fly. Use a sticky fabric cleaner for pet hair, or a strip of masking tape, to clean cat fur off furniture and other surfaces before it gets on your clothes. Most cat messes are sporadic and easy to clean. If your cat soils your carpets and never did this before, or she constantly soils the carpets, call your vet. It could be a sign of a health problem that needs attention."
439,"Untreated clinical depression is a serious problem. Untreated depression increases the chance of risky behaviors such as drug or alcohol addiction. It also can ruin relationships, cause problems at work, and make it difficult to overcome serious illnesses. Clinical depression, also known as major depression, is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. Clinical depression affects the way you eat and sleep. It affects the way you feel about yourself and those around you. It even affects your thoughts. People who are depressed cannot simply âpull themselves togetherâ and be cured. Without proper treatment, including antidepressants and/or psychotherapy, untreated clinical depression can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people with depression. There is mounting evidence that clinical depression takes a serious toll on physical health. The most recent studies exploring health and major depression have looked at patients with stroke or coronary artery disease. Results have shown that people with major depression who are recovering from strokes or heart attacks have a more difficult time making health care choices. They also find it more difficult to follow their doctor's instructions and to cope with the challenges their illness presents. Another study found that patients with major depression have a higher risk of death in the first few months after a heart attack. One of the most telling symptoms of clinical depression is a change in sleep patterns. Though the most common problem is insomnia (difficulty getting adequate sleep), people sometimes feel an increased need for sleep and experience excessive energy loss. Lack of sleep can cause some of the same symptoms as depression -- extreme tiredness, loss of energy, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. In addition, untreated depression may result in weight gain or loss, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, and irritability. Treating the depression helps the person get control over all of these depression symptoms. Common signs of insomnia include: Daytime fatigue Irritability and difficulty concentrating Sleep that never feels like ""enough"" Trouble falling asleep Trouble going back to sleep after waking up during the night Waking up at all hours of the night Waking up before the alarm clock goes off Alcohol and drug abuse are common among people with clinical depression. They're especially common among teens and among young and middle-age males. It is very important to encourage these people to get help, because they are more likely to attempt suicide. Signs of drug and alcohol abuse include: Inability to maintain personal relationships Secretive alcohol use Self-pity Tremors Unexplained memory loss Unwillingness to talk about drugs or alcohol Those who suffer depression and abuse drugs or alcohol may need very specialized treatment. Men who have untreated clinical depression may exhibit more anger, frustration, and violent behavior than women. In addition, men with untreated depression may take dangerous risks such as reckless driving and having unsafe sex. Men are not aware that physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain, can be symptoms of depression. Depression can render people disabled in their work life, family life, and social life. Left untreated, clinical depression is as costly as heart disease or AIDS to the U. S. economy. Untreated depression is responsible for more than 200 million days lost from work each year. The annual cost of untreated depression is more than $43.7 billion in absenteeism from work, lost productivity, and direct treatment costs. Living with a depressed person is very difficult and stressful for family members and friends. It's often helpful to have a family member involved in the evaluation and treatment of a depressed relative. Sometimes marital or even family therapy is indicated. Depression carries a high risk of suicide. This is the worst but very real outcome of untreated or under-treated depression. Anybody who expresses suicidal thoughts or intentions should be taken very, very seriously. Do not hesitate to call your local suicide hotline immediately. Call 800- SUICIDE (800-784-2433) or 800-273- TALK (800-273-8255) -- or the deaf hotline at 800-799-4889. Most people who suffer from clinical depression do not attempt suicide. But according to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 90% of people who die from suicide have depression and other mental disorders, or a substance abuse disorder. Men commit almost 75% of suicides, even though twice as many women attempt it. The elderly experience more depression and suicide than you might think. Forty percent of all suicide victims are adults over the age of 60. Older adults suffer more frequently from depression because of the frequent loss of loved ones and friends as they age. They also experience more chronic illnesses, more major life changes like retirement, and the transition into assisted living or nursing care. Warning signs of suicide include: Talking, writing, or thinking about killing or hurting oneself or threatening to do so Depression (deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating) that gets worse Having a ""death wish;"" tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death -- for example, driving through red lights Losing interest in things one used to care about Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, or changing a will Saying things like ""it would be better if I wasn't here"" or "" I want out"" A sudden switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy Suddenly visiting or calling people one cares about Talking about suicide Increase in drinking alcohol or using drugs Writing a suicidal note Watching well publicized murder and/or suicide reports in the media Conducting on-line searches on ways to commit suicide Seeking methods to kill oneself, such as getting a gun or pills For in depth information, see Web MD's Depression and Suicide. More than 80% of people with clinical depression can be successfully treated with early recognition, intervention, and support. Depression affects almost 19 million people each year, including a large portion of the working population. People with untreated depression can usually get to work. But once there, they may be irritable, fatigued, and have difficulty concentrating. Untreated depression makes it difficult for employees to work well. Most people do best with depression treatment using psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of both. For treatment-resistant depression, one that does not respond to medication, there are alternative treatments. One example is electroconvulsive therapy or ECT."
440,"When your child has a primary immunodeficiency disease ( PIDD), his body has a harder time fighting germs that make people sick. He may get a lot of infections in his ears, lungs, skin, or other areas that take a long time to go away. Most cases happen in babies or young children, but sometimes it doesn't show up until adulthood. There are many different types -- more than 200 -- and they affect different parts of the immune system. All make it more likely that he'll get sick from infections. Everyone with a PIDD has a different experience. If your child has it, in most cases he'll be able to go to school and make friends like other kids. As an adult with a PIDD, he'll be able to work and have an active, normal life. If your child's PIDD is mild, he may need to take medicines to treat the infections he gets. Doctors treat some of the more serious types of PIDD with doses of antibodies to fight infections. He'll get these antibodies through an IV in his veins. The treatment takes several hours, and he'll need one every few weeks. Some severe forms of PIDD may need even more serious treatment: a bone marrow transplant, which has a long recovery time. When you first learn that your child has a PIDD, you might worry that infections are going to rage out of control. But there are lots of treatments that can keep symptoms in check and help your child stay healthy and active. You don't have to face this alone. Reach out to family and friends for emotional support. Talk to your doctor about how to meet other families who have faced PIDDs, too. They'll understand what you're going through. You can't catch PIDDs like you can a cold or the flu. Your child has it because he was born with a broken gene that affects his immune system. Sometimes this problem runs in families. Or it may have happened on its own. Normally, your body's white blood cells fight infections. Some people with PIDDs are missing certain types of white blood cells, or those cells don't work very well. If that's true for your child, he's more likely to get sick from infections that wouldn't take hold in someone else. You may not notice any symptoms until your child is a few months old. He may get a lot of serious infections, or his illness may start out as a common cold but turn into bronchitis or pneumonia. Signs that your child may have a PIDD include: Has four or more infections a year in the ears, lungs, skin, eyes, mouth, or private parts Needs to get antibiotics through an IV for infections Gets more than one severe, fast-moving illness, like septicemia, a bacterial infection of the blood Has thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth) that doesn't go away Antibiotics don't work well Gets pneumonia more than once a year Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Has your child had a lot of severe infections? If so, how long do they last? Does your child stay sick even after taking antibiotics? Do other people in your family tend to get sick a lot? Your doctor may also want your child to get some blood tests. He'll draw some blood and send it to a lab to get it analyzed. Some tests will count the number of white blood cells that your child's body has. Other tests will measure certain proteins that fight disease, called immunoglobulins. Many states now test newborns for the most severe kind of PIDD, called SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency). What else could cause these symptoms? How can I keep my child from getting sick? What reactions should I expect from the treatment? Should my child get all the usual vaccines? Does my child need to stay away from some sports? Infections are going to happen, but treatments can take care of symptoms so your child can get well ASAP and get back to doing his favorite things. He may need to get higher doses of infection-fighting medications and take them for a longer time. If an infection is serious, your child might need to get antibiotics put into his veins through an IV. Even if he's not sick now, your doctor may give him antibiotics or other medicines to prevent an illness. Your doctor may also suggest treatments that can make your child's immune system work better: Immunoglobulin ( Ig) replacement therapy. These are disease-fighting proteins called antibodies that your child needs. Doctors usually give it through a needle, by IV. The antibodies only last so long, so your child may need a treatment every 3 or 4 weeks. He might have some side effects such as achy muscles or joints, headaches, or a low fever. Stem cell transplant. It's rare, but for a very severe PIDD, your child could need a stem cell transplant. In some cases, it's a cure. Stem cells help make new blood cells. They come from bone marrow, which is the soft center of the bones. For a transplant, a donor supplies stem cells with unbroken genes. Your child will need to find someone who is the right match so that his body accepts the new cells. Close relatives, such as a brother or sister, are the best chance. Someone from the same racial or ethnic background may also be a good donor. If no one you know is a match, you can put your child on a waiting list. During the transplant, your child will get the new stem cells through an IV. He won't feel any pain from this, and he'll be awake while it's happening. It could take 2 to 6 weeks for the new stem cells to multiply and start making healthy, working blood cells. During this time, your child may need to stay in the hospital or, at the very least, make visits every day to get checked by his transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of good blood cells in his body gets up to normal. Even with a PIDD, your child will be able to go to school, make friends, and keep up with activities. You'll want to meet with his teachers to explain his condition and to let them know he may need to miss classes because of illness more often than other kids. You should also let the school know about medications he'll need to take. Just like anyone else, your child should eat good foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Make exercise a habit, and see that he gets plenty of sleep, too. To keep germs away, wash hands often, lathering up with soap for at least 20 seconds. Teach him to keep rubbing his soapy hands together while singing the "" Happy Birthday"" song twice, which is long enough to get the job done. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available. Stress can make it harder for his body to fight disease. Encourage him to take time to relax, play, and enjoy hobbies. Massage therapy, exercise, being with people he likes, and prayer or meditation are some other ways to lower his stress. Everyone's experience with a PIDD is different because there are so many types of this disease. Most people, with the right treatment, can live a full and active life. The most severe forms of the disease may be treated, and possibly cured, with stem cell transplants, although that's not an easy process. When your child has this illness, the whole family will need lots of emotional support from people like friends, extended family members, and neighbors. Talk to your doctor about getting in touch with other families who have a child with a severe PIDD and can understand what it's like. The web site of the Immune Deficiency Foundation can help you find a doctor or get in touch with a support group. The site also has information about clinical trials. These test new drugs to see if they're safe and how well they work. Trials are a way for people to try medicines that aren't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if this is a good option for your child."
441,"Does that pile of used tissues on your co-worker's desk make you nervous about getting sick? Or are you worried you may give your cold to your family? Then it's time for action. Take some simple steps now to stop the spread of germs. Wash your hands . It's the single best way to avoid a cold. Once germs are on your hands, it's easy for them to get into your body when you touch your eyes or mouth. Do it thoroughly: Use soap and water. Scrub for at least 20 seconds. Wash before you eat or prepare food and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper. If you're taking care of someone who's sick, wash your hands before and after being with them. Use hand sanitizer. It's the next best thing if you can't get to a sink. Keep a small bottle with you -- at work, in your car, and in your purse. Buy one with at least 60% alcohol. Rub it all over your hands until they're dry. Cover your nose and mouth . It's one of the best ways to keep a cold or flu away from your friends. Cough or sneeze into a tissue, then throw it out right away. If you don't have one with you, don't cough into your hand. You'll just smear germs on the next thing you touch. Instead, cough into the crook of your elbow. Disinfect your space. You don't need to spend all day spraying disinfectant on every surface of your house. Still, if someone in your family is sick, use one to wipe down high-traffic spots: computers, phones, doorknobs, and TV remotes. Use disposables. Cold and flu germs can cling to fabric. So when someone in your house is sick, replace cloth hand towels and dishrags with paper towels. Remove water glasses and add paper cups in the bathroom, too. Get a flu vaccine . Anyone over 6 months old should get one. It's especially important if you're in a group that doctors say is at high risk for getting sick: Children Adults older than 50 Women who will be pregnant during flu season Nursing home residents People with asthma or a long-term heart or lung condition People with diabetes or another condition that weakens the immune system -- the body's defense against germs Health care workers For the best protection, get the flu vaccine when it comes out each year in October or November. But even later is better than not at all. It takes 2 weeks for the flu vaccine to take effect, and flu season can last into March or April. Keep your distance. If possible, stay away from people who have a cold or the flu. If you can't -- because you're caring for a sick family member, for instance -- step up your hand-washing routine and your attention to other defenses against germs. Take care of yourself. Experts think that healthy living may help boost your immune system. So make sure you eat nutritious food, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. Stay home when you're sick. If you go to school or work when you don't feel well, you can make a lot of people sick. Although a cold or flu might not be a big deal for you, it can be serious for people with weak immune systems, like young children, the elderly, and anyone with a long-term health problem. Working while you're sick isn't good for you, either. It can make it harder for your body to fight off a cold. So do what's best for you and everyone else. Take a couple of days off."
442,"Your tooth has been bothering you for weeks. Now the pain has become unbearable. Maybe your jaw has been sore lately. Or you lost a tooth recently. Is a trip to the dentist enough? What if you need to see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon? How do you know? If you have problems with your teeth, gums, or jaws, go see your dentist, even if the pain is in the area around your mouth or face. If it's an emergency and a dentist is not available, head to an urgent care clinic rather than the ER. It's best, though, to try to avoid both if possible. They will only administer medication for the symptoms and tell you to see a dentist. They may also charge 3 to 4 times what it may cost to solve the problem. Your dentist can handle most oral problems. If he thinks you need an oral surgeon, he'll recommend one. If your dentist recommends maxillofacial surgery, he's talking about a specialty of dentistry that relates to your face and jaws. It's a surgery that treats disease and injuries of the areas around your mouth. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must complete extra training and education beyond what is normal for a dentist. Some get a medical degree (an MD) along with their oral surgery diplomas. They put in at least 4 years of training in a hospital-based surgical program alongside medical residents in many different specialties, including anesthesia. That includes various types of IV sedation, including ""twilight sleep"" and general anesthesia, where you're unconscious and can't feel any pain. It can also include local anesthesia, where only a small area of your body is numbed for your procedure. An oral surgeon can help you out of several situations. Impacted teeth: This mostly happens with wisdom teeth. But it can happen in other places in your mouth, too. When the teeth come through the gums for the first time, it might be crowded, so they either don't come out at all or don't come out completely. This can cause sore gums and infections. Your dentist or surgeon might recommend you get your wisdom teeth pulled, even before they present any problems. Jaw-joint issues: The temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) connects your jaw to your skull. It's that little âhingeâ right in front of the ears. It can cause problems like pain in your jaw, jaw-popping, stiffness, and headaches. Oral devices, pain medication, and ice packs can help. But people with recurring problems may need oral surgery. Overbite/underbite: If your jaw or teeth aren't aligned properly, your dentist may recommend orthognathic surgery. It's an option for people with excessive overbites or underbites, trouble chewing or swallowing, certain birth defects, or sleep apnea. Often, an orthodontist can correct your teeth if they don't line up. But if it's caused by your jaw, some time with an oral surgeon might be necessary. Implants: You can replace a missing tooth with a dental implant. The surgeon imbeds a titanium implant into your jaw, then your dentist attaches a crown. Sleep and breathing issues: This covers things like snoring and sleep apnea, a condition that causes you to stop breathing for brief periods during sleep. A doctor with special training may recommend a CPAP machine or other appliance that can open your airway. He may also want you to have surgery, and you'd go to an oral surgeon. The type of surgery you'd have would depend on what's blocking your breathing. It could be that your airway just needs to be made bigger or it could mean that a specific part of your mouth or nasal passages needs to be adjusted. You could have a procedure in a doctor's office and go home the same day. If the surgery you need is a bit more involved, you may have to spend a few days in the hospital and maybe have your jaw wired shut. Cancer treatment: Oral surgeons also treat cancers, not just of the mouth, but also of the head and neck, like of the salivary glands, sinuses, throat, larynx, and lips. Oral surgeons can also help with: Nerve repair Cleft lips and cleft palate surgery Removal of lesions on the face or inside the mouth If you have problems with your teeth or gums, talk with your dentist. He might be able to fix it. If not, an oral surgeon can give you the relief you're searching for."
443,"We've come a long way from the days when people were so worried they might catch HIV that they avoided people with it altogether. Still, some people may not be sure exactly what's safe and what's not. It's true that HIV is a virus, like a cold or the flu -- but it doesn't spread the same way. In fact, it's a lot harder to give it to someone else. You can only get it when certain fluids from someone who's infected get into your body. So, how does that happen? No. HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Hugging and shaking hands are safe. It's possible, but it hardly ever happens. HIV isn't spread through saliva. But if you kiss someone who's infected and has bleeding gums or sores, you could get the virus if you also have cuts or sores around or in your mouth -- because of the blood-to-blood contact. No, the virus doesn't travel through air. Not like that. Sweat and tears don't carry HIV. And even though they might have a trace of blood, there have been no reported cases of HIV from vomit or pee. Yes, and either partner can get it! A woman can get HIV through the tissue that lines her vagina and cervix. The virus can get into a man through the opening of his penis or through a small cut or sore on it. Effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) will greatly reduce the chances that an HIV infected person can give HIV to his/her partner in this way. However, even when HIV drugs are used, use a condom to cut your chances of the virus passing between you, as well as getting any other sexually transmitted infections. Yes, indeed! If you're trying to catch HIV, this is the way to have sex. Either partner can get it from the other. And while condoms work to protect you if they stay in place, they're more likely to break during this kind of sex. Again, effective antretroviral therapy in the HIV-infected partner will reduce the chances of passing HIV. However, condoms should be used to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. You might, but it's not nearly as likely as when you have anal or vaginal sex. Still, it can happen. The person who ends up with semen or vaginal fluid in their mouth is at greater risk. Again, use a condom, latex barrier, or dental dam. No, for several reasons. First, there's not likely to be the right kind of body fluid on public surfaces. And if there were, the virus would probably die before you got to it; it can't live long outside a body. And it would still have to get through your skin or into you somehow. That's not a problem. Sharing dishes, glasses, and eating utensils is safe. Remember, HIV isn't in saliva, and it dies quickly once it's outside the body. Probably not, even if there are traces of blood or another fluid in it. The virus can't survive the cooking process or your stomach acid. Passing HIV through eating has happened only in rare cases, when children ate food that was already chewed by someone with the virus. Nope, not through insects. Yes, and it's not just the needles. Any of the supplies for preparing drugs for injection -- syringes, bottle caps, spoons, or containers -- could have the virus if someone with HIV used it first. In theory, yes, if the needles were used on someone with HIV before you and then not sterilized. But the CDC says no cases have been reported of someone getting the virus this way. Again, theoretically yes, but in the U. S., there's little risk. Careful testing makes sure that blood bank supplies are HIV-free. Maybe. Body fluids like blood can pass through broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes. But it's very rare. It's possible if a bite or scratch breaks your skin, but (yes, again) it's extremely rare. And if your skin doesn't break, there's no chance. Getting spit on is unpleasant and messy, but not a danger as far as catching HIV. A woman infected with HIV can pass the virus to her child during pregnancy or while she's giving birth, or though her breast milk. The chances are greatly reduced, however if the mother is taking effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) throughout her pregnancy, labor, and delivery."

Most commonly, herpes type 1 causes sores around the mouth and lips (sometimes called fever blisters or cold sores). HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2. In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum. Although HSV-2 sores may occur in other locations, these sores usually are found below the waist. Herpes simplex type 1, which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin, can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils. In general, a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. It is important to know that both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread even if sores are not present. Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor, as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth. For many people with the herpes virus, which can go through periods of being dormant, attacks (or outbreaks) can be brought on by the following conditions: General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions) Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity Menstruation Symptoms of herpes simplex virus typically appear as a blister or as multiple blisters on or around affected areas -- usually the mouth, genitals, or rectum. The blisters break, leaving tender sores. Often, the appearance of herpes simplex virus is typical and no testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If a health care provider is uncertain, herpes simplex can be diagnosed with lab tests, including DNA -- or PCR -- tests and virus cultures. Although there is no cure for herpes, treatments can relieve the symptoms. Medication can decrease the pain related to an outbreak and can shorten healing time. They can also decrease the total number of outbreaks. Drugs including Famvir, Zovirax, and Valtrex are among the drugs used to treat the symptoms of herpes. Warm baths may relieve the pain associated with genital sores. Some people experience very mild genital herpes symptoms or no symptoms at all. Frequently, people infected with the virus don't even know they have it. However, when it causes symptoms, it can be described as extremely painful. This is especially true for the first outbreak, which is often the worst. Outbreaks are described as aches or pains in or around the genital area or burning, pain, or difficulty urinating. Some people experience discharge from the vagina or penis. Oral herpes lesions (cold sores) usually cause tingling and burning just prior to the breakout of the blisters. The blisters themselves can also be painful. There is no cure for herpes simplex. Once a person has the virus, it remains in the body. The virus lies inactive in the nerve cells until something triggers it to become active again."
445,"Lead poisoning is a serious risk for young kids. According to the Centers of Disease Control, more than half a million children ages 1-5 in the U. S. have blood lead levels high enough to damage their health. Even with treatment, lead poisoning can permanently affect a child's development. Because their bodies are small and growing, babies and young children are at greatest risk. Many parents don't know much about how to prevent lead poisoning. Lead isn't only in paint chips. It can show up in surprising places -- like dust on your windowsill, or in your vegetable garden, or in a playground. Here are five surprising sources of lead -- and tips on how to keep your kids safe. Lead Dust Parents might worry about a baby eating big chips of lead paint. But it's the little paint chips -- so small that they're just bits of dust -- that experts say are a bigger concern. Although lead-based paint hasn't been sold since 1978, plenty of older homes still have it. Tiny fragments of lead paint can float through the air and accumulate on surfaces throughout your house. Babies can pick them up on their hands and get them into their mouths. They can also breathe them in directly. Contrary to what you might think, it doesn't take much. Even at very low levels of exposure, lead dust can cause harm. What you can do: If you live in a home built before 1978, have your home tested for lead. Ideally, hire a trained professional. Although less reliable, you could also test surface paint yourself with a home kit. If you have lead, look into abatement. It can be expensive. Often, a cheaper option is encapsulation -- sealing the lead paint with a fresh layer of new paint. Whatever you do, don't start scraping or sanding paint without precautions. That will just send lead dust throughout your home. Lead and Home Renovations Once you start a repair, painting, or renovation project in an older home, you can expose lead paint and send particles of it into the air. Some states report that renovations are the single most common cause of childhood lead poisoning. One study in Wisconsin found that kids who lived in a building while it was being renovated had a 30% higher chance of lead poisoning than kids who didn't. What you can do: If you're in an older home, be cautious before starting renovations. You should assume that there's lead in the paint unless you know otherwise. Remember that home kits will only test for lead on the surface, not in the layers beneath. Check to make sure that your contractor or painter has been certified by the EPA in lead-safe work practices. If you're doing the construction yourself, get information from the EPA or the National Lead Information Center on how to do it safely. If there's construction going on at your child's daycare or school, make certain they are taking precautions to prevent lead poisoning too. Lead in the Backyard or Playground Any structures built before 1978 -- houses, schools, barns, sheds, fences, and playground equipment -- might have once had lead paint on the exterior. As that paint breaks down, it can contaminate the soil beneath it. A child playing in a yard or playground could pick up lead on her hands and swallow it. Some types of artificial turf and rubber playground surfaces can also contain lead. Contaminated soil can affect the plants that grow in it. Carrots and other vegetables grown in lead-tainted soil can contain lead. What you can do: Call your local department of health and ask how to get your soil tested for lead. If it's positive, you have a few options. You could reduce the risk by covering the area with thick grass, wood chips, or gravel; you could also pave it. Fencing off the area is another way to prevent your child from playing near it. Never grow a garden in soil that's contaminated with lead. It's not worth the risk. Lead in Children's Toys Imported toys tainted with lead can be an issue. The lead can be both in the paint and in the plastic itself. Sucking or chewing on the toy -- or getting lead on the hands -- can be enough to poison a child. Old toys are also a risk, especially if they have peeling paint. Swallowing a toy with high lead levels can be very dangerous. Several kids have become gravely ill as a result. What You Can Do: It's hard to be absolutely sure if a toy has lead in it or not. Start by checking www.recalls.gov to see if a specific toy has been recalled. Be wary of cheaper toys -- like those from vending machines or street fairs -- and especially plastic jewelry. If you notice that your child is putting a toy in her mouth frequently and you're not absolutely sure it's lead-free, take it away. To lower the risks of poisoning, make sure that your child is playing with age-appropriate toys that he's not at risk of swallowing. Don't let your kids play with older toys if you don't know they're lead-free. That can mean declining hand-me-downs and toys purchased at garage sales or thrift stores. Remove any toy with chipped paint. The safest choices for toys are unpainted wood, stuffed animals, and books. Lead in Water Pipes 10%-20% of childhood lead poisoning is caused by contaminated drinking water. It might not surprise you that old plumbing -- especially from 1930 or earlier -- can contain lead. Some pipes were actually made of lead, and brass fixtures can also contain some lead. Here's what is surprising: pipes in very new homes are potentially a greater risk for lead. Some plumbers still use lead solder to join copper pipes, which exposes the water directly to lead. The risk is highest in houses that are less than five years old; after that, mineral deposits build up in the pipes that insulate the water from the lead in the solder. According to the EPA, you should assume that any building less than five years old has lead-contaminated water. Private wells can also be contaminated by lead in pump components or the well seal. Although pipes inside a home are usually the source of lead poisoning, sometimes lead comes from old pipes in the street that supply the water to your home. What You Can Do: Contact your local health department or water utility to find out how you can get your water tested for lead. If the source of the lead is in your home it -- in pipes, solder, or well equipment -- and you can't afford to remove it, take other precautions. Only use cold water for cooking or drinking -- or for making baby formula -- because hot water is more likely to contain higher lead levels. If you haven't used a faucet in the last six hours, flush it out for one to two minutes before drinking or cooking with it. The longer water has been sitting in the pipes, the more lead it can absorb. You can also consider a filter that has been proven to remove lead by an independent testing organization, like NSF international. Other Tips for Reducing Lead Poisoning Risks If there's lead in your home -- or there might be -- taking some simple precautions can reduce your child's risks. Keep your home clean. Try to control dust in your house. Regularly wipe it up with a wet sponge or rag, especially in areas where friction might create dust from paint, like drawers, windows, and doors. Don't track lead in from outside. Take off your shoes as you enter the house. Keep your child's hands clean. Many children who get lead poisoning transfer lead from their hands to their mouths. Get in the habit of washing your child's hands frequently. Wash toys, pacifiers, and bottles regularly. Anything that goes in your child's mouth needs to be clean. Eat a healthy diet. Children who eat healthier diets seem to absorb less lead than children who don't. Make sure your kids have the recommended lead tests. Since lead poisoning has no symptoms, it's the only way to make sure that they haven't been affected. Routine testing is recommended for children younger than age 5. Ask your doctor about whether or not your older children should also be tested."
446,"You can get rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) at any age, but it's most likely to show up between ages 30 and 50. When it starts between ages 60 and 65, it's called elderly-onset RA or late-onset RA. Elderly-onset RA is different from RA that starts in earlier years. It also comes with a separate set of treatment challenges. Even though RA gets more common as you get older, people who get RA later in life only make up about one-third of all people with the disease. There are some key differences between elderly-onset RA and early-onset RA, which happens in young and middle-age adults. Women and men get elderly-onset RA at nearly the same rate. Among younger people, women are more likely to have RA. Symptoms come on quickly in elderly-onset RA. You may hear this called acute onset. If you get RA when you're younger, symptoms tend to show up over time. Elderly-onset RA usually strikes large joints, like shoulders. With younger people, the disease mostly starts in small joints, like your fingers and toes. Rheumatoid factor ( RF) is less common in elderly-onset RA. Rheumatoid factor is a protein. If your blood tests show you have it, those proteins may attack healthy tissues. Around 80% of people with early-onset RA have RF. Overall, elderly-onset RA takes less of a toll. It tends to be less severe. The exception is if you have RF. Your RA will probably be more aggressive RA than someone who doesn't have RF. You'll notice more than just joint pain. Look out for: Fever Muscle pain (myalgia) Weight loss Anemia Your tab tests may show: Elevated CRP ( C-reactive protein) Elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) It can be hard to spot this condition. Your doctor has to figure out if it's really late-onset or if you've had the disease for years. Elderly-onset RA also has symptoms that overlap with other diseases, like: Polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) Late-onset psoriatic arthritis Crystal arthritis Viral arthritis Osteoarthritis Rotator cuff tendinitis Hypothyroidism Parkinson's disease It may be hardest to tell elderly-onset RA from PMR, which has similar aches and test results (like elevated CRP and ESR levels). Your treatment goal is remission, the lowest possible level of disease activity. This can prevent joint damage and can keep your joints working like they should. Your doctor will probably give you the same drugs used to treat early-onset RA. These include: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) Biologic drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Corticosteroids You might have more challenges with your medication, especially if you take drugs for other health conditions. This boosts your chances of a bad reaction to the medicine. You may also have a harder time with drug side effects. NSAIDs increase your chances of heart, brain, gut, and kidney problems. Corticosteroids up the odds of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and other health problems. Elderly-onset RA may not be the only cause of your joint pain. You could also have osteoarthritis. Even if you take RA drugs, they may not do enough to reduce your pain and keep your joints working. Gentle exercise can help, even if you've never done it before or can't get around much. Ask your doctor about: Physical therapy Exercise programs Aquatherapy Balance exercises"
447,"When it comes to germs, it's not all about the bathroom. The kitchen is the germiest room in the house. From the countertops and sink to the cutting boards and refrigerator, the kitchen is teeming with billions of microorganisms. But you can tackle those nasty kitchen germs that lurk where you prepare your family's meals. Here are some kitchen hot spots and tips for how to clean them. Kitchen sponge. This is probably the most germ-filled item in your house. It's used to sop up all kinds of germs and grime and then often stored under the sink -- a wet, dark place that's a perfect environment for bacteria to grow. Experts point out that when you use a sponge throughout your kitchen -- wiping dishes, counters, or the sink -- you're just moving germs from one spot to another. While zapping the sponge in the microwave will get rid of some germs, it won't get rid of all of them. There are dead spots where the microwaves or heat doesn't reach, like cold spots in food, and germs survive there. Washing a sponge in the dishwasher also isn't enough to kill germs unless you have an extremely high-heat germicide cycle. As an alternative, you can use paper towels or a clean cloth; be sure to use the cloth only once and then toss it in the laundry. If you do use sponges, you can soak them between cleanings in a solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water, or vinegar and water. Soak them in the bleach solution for about 5 minutes or in the vinegar solution for 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and let air dry. Counters. Spraying a 10% vinegar solution on counters will wipe out lots of kitchen counter germs at once. Keep the surface wet for 30 to 60 seconds, then wipe. Keep purses, briefcases, lunchboxes, keys, mail, and electronic devices like remote controls off countertops because they're teeming with germs. Cutting boards. It's a good idea to have one cutting board for raw meats, poultry, and seafood, and another for produce and bread. Disinfect cutting boards by soaking them in straight vinegar or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water for about 30 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly with hot, soapy water or put them in the dishwasher. Using the dishwasher alone isn't enough to sanitize them. Refrigerator. Refrigeration doesn't kill bacteria -- it just slows their growth. The more you open and close the refrigerator door, the greater your chance of bringing in mold. Every so often, wash down all surfaces of your fridge -- including racks and drawers -- with a vinegar solution. Wash the refrigerator door handle frequently with a bleach solution. Floor. Kitchen floors can be subject to dropped food, dripped juices from raw meats, tracked-in dirt, crawling kids, and pets, among other things. Using the same bleach solution that you use to clean cutting boards provides good sanitization, but be sure to rinse thoroughly and let air dry if kids and pets will be on the floor. You may want to ask people to take off their shoes when they come in the door, especially if they're going to be in the kitchen. Dishwasher. Do you see a black fungus on the seal around your dishwasher door or inside your dishwasher? It may be Exophiala dermatitidis, a fungus that likes high heat and is resistant to most detergents. Scrub it away with a paste of vinegar and baking soda. While you're in the dishwasher, pour a couple of cups of vinegar in the bottom and run a cycle to kill other tough germs. Garbage disposal. Garbage disposals are convenient, but they're also kitchen germ hazards, experts say. Any food that remains can decay and breed germs. At least once a week, use a brush and the bleach solution to scrub as far down as you can into the disposal. Trash can. Make sure to keep a lid on your trash can. Not only will it keep smells from spreading, it can also keep insects from landing in bacteria and spreading them throughout the rest of your house. It's not enough to just replace the trash bag. Once a week, pour the bleach solution into the can -- especially if there's a smell, stain, or substance inside. Let the liquid sit for a few minutes and then pour it down your sink. Rinse the trash can and let it air dry. Handles. When you move around the kitchen, opening cabinets, the refrigerator, or the pantry door to grab ingredients as you cook, you can spread germs among the handles. Wipe cabinet and refrigerator door handles at least once a week with the bleach solution to kill microorganisms. Don't get overwhelmed by kitchen cleaning. When tackling kitchen germs, first clean the areas that look dirty. Get rid of mold in the refrigerator and dust on the countertops, for example. Then sanitize and disinfect."
448,"Kidney stones usually pass on their own without causing any long-term problems. If they don't, or if you're in a lot of pain, your doctor can break up or remove the crystals. Your treatment depends on where and how big your stone is and what symptoms you have. If your stone doesn't bother you, your doctor may suggest you wait 2-4 weeks for it to pass on its own. She may tell you to drink extra water to help flush it out of your body. She may ask you to catch the stone in a strainer when you pee. A lab can test it for minerals to see if medication might prevent more stones. If you're in discomfort, you can manage your symptoms while you wait for the stone to exit. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help. You might also need a drug to ease nausea. Prescription drugs can help: Calcium channel blockers and alpha-blockers: These relax your ureter, the tube through which pee passes from your kidney to your bladder. A wider ureter will help the stone move more quickly. Potassium citrate or sodium citrate: Can help keep kidney stones created by uric acid from forming. Sometimes, a stone is too big come out by itself. Your doctor may have to break it up or remove it. She also may do that if you are: In a lot of pain Have an infection Unable to pee because the stone is blocking the flow or stone is blocking urine from one kidney (in which case you might still be able to pee) Your doctor can choose from several procedures. Shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL). This is the most common treatment in the U. S. It works best for small or medium stones. Your doctor aims high-energy sound waves to break up the kidney stone into little pieces. The shock waves come from outside the body, which is why the procedure sometimes is called extracorporeal SWL. You will get pain-numbing medicine beforehand, and you usually can go home on the same day. Ureteroscopy. Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible scope through your urethra, bladder and then into your ureter to reach the stone. If the stone is small, she can use a basket to remove it. If the stone is larger, a laser passed through the scope can break it up. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. These similar surgical procedures are options if your stone is large or if other procedures fail to break them down enough. Your doctor uses a thin tube inserted through your skin to reach the stone and them removes (nephrolithotomy) or breaks (nephrolithotripsy) it. You will be given drugs so you won't be awake or feel pain. You'll likely have to stay in the hospital for 1-2 days. Open surgery: This might be an option if your stone is very oversized or your doctor can't take it out with other treatments. You'll be sedated and not awake. Your surgeon cuts through your side to reach the kidney, then takes the stone out through the opening. You may need to stay in the hospital for a few days. It can take 4-6 weeks for you to fully recover. Your surgeon usually will ask a lab to identify the type of stone, so you might be able to take meds to avoid them in the future. You have many options to deal with and to prevent a kidney stone. Be sure you understand the pros and cons of each treatment, including doing nothing. Ask your doctor: How long should I wait for my stone to pass on its own? How much water should I drink? What foods should I eat? For which symptoms should I call you? What can I do to prevent another stone from forming after treatment?"
449,"Treatment for bipolar depression has come a long way from the days (not so long ago) when patients were given sedatives and medications with numerous side effects. Today, mood stabilizing drugs are a mainstay treatment for bipolar disorder. Doctors may prescribe lithium, an antimanic drug, or an antipsychotic drug -- or a combination of both -- in order to alleviate symptoms of depression without triggering a manic episode. While depression episodes are far more common than manias and have a tremendous effect on the lives of patients, there are only a few established treatments for bipolar depression. Lithium and the anticonvulsants lamotrigine and valproate are mood stabilizers that are sometimes used ""off label"" as treatments for bipolar depression, although none of these has been established as an FDA-approved first-line treatment for bipolar depression. For many years, psychiatrists have traditionally added an antidepressant to a mood stabilizer if a mood stabilizer alone is ineffective; however, research shows that antidepressants are often not effective for bipolar depression. A mood-stabilizing medication works on improving social interactions, mood, and behavior and is recommended for both treatment and prevention of bipolar mood states that swing from the lows of depression to the highs of hypomania or mania. According to the American Psychiatric Association ( APA), lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine, and most atypical antipsychotic medications are approved by the FDA for treating one (or more) phases of bipolar disorder. In some patients with bipolar disorder, a mood stabilizer may be all that's needed to modulate the depressed mood. However, in bipolar patients who do not respond to one mood stabilizer, another mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic is sometimes added to the treatment regimen. While antidepressants are effective treatment for people with major depressive (unipolar) disorder, they are not always as effective for bipolar depression, and generally should not be given alone (monotherapy) in people with bipolar I disorder. When antidepressants are given alone to someone with bipolar disorder, there's a risk the drug might ignite a manic episode in some patients. Knowing this, most doctors may avoid using antidepressants as monotherapy for bipolar depression. A very large randomized study sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH) called the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder ( STEP- BD) showed that mood stabilizers alone produced a stable improvement only in about 1 in 4 people with bipolar depression, and surprisingly, adding an antidepressant to the mood stabilizer did not boost improvement further. The STEP- BD study underscored the need to find treatments other than mood stabilizers or antidepressants for bipolar depression. Studies have shown that some antipsychotic drugs can also treat bipolar depression. Quetiapine ( Seroquel, Seroquel XR) is used for the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. Another option is olanzapine ( Zyprexa) with or without fluoxetine ( Prozac). The atypical antipsychotic lurasidone ( Latuda) can be taken alone or with lithium or valproate for treating bipolar depression. Cariprazine ( Vraylar), a treatment for bipolar disorder, may also be an off-label option. These medications work by affecting receptors (called neurotransmitters) for chemicals in the brain that help regulate mood and behavior. Your doctor will weigh the pros and cons of the available medications to help you get relief from the bipolar depression without the risk of mania or drug interactions. Central nervous system ( CNS) depressants, which include the benzodiazepines, act on neurotransmitters to slow down normal brain function. CNS depressants are commonly used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders and may be an effective alternative or adjunctive therapy in some bipolar patients with acute mania. Some commonly used benzodiazepines include clonazepam ( Klonopin), lorazepam ( Ativan), alprazolam ( Xanax), and diazepam ( Valium). These drugs all can be addictive and can cause sluggish thinking. They generally should be used only to treat agitation or sleep problems during the acute phase of the illness and not as long-term medications. They typically should be tapered off rather than stopped abruptly, in order to minimize the risk of drug withdrawal. Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association suggest that ECT is an appropriate and sometimes preferred treatment for depressed bipolar patients who have psychotic symptoms or a very high risk for suicidal behavior. In addition, ECT may benefit women who are pregnant and suffer with severe bipolar depression or mania. Along with medications for bipolar depression, patients may benefit from ongoing psychotherapy. This one-on-one therapy combines interpersonal psychotherapy with behavioral techniques to help patients learn how to more effectively manage interpersonal problems, stay on their medications, and normalize their lifestyle habits. The STEP- BD study mentioned earlier found that in addition to medications, adding a structured psychotherapy -- such as cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal/social rhythm therapy, or family-focused therapy -- can speed up treatment response in bipolar depression by as much as 150%."
450,"The side effects of breast cancer treatment that people around you might notice can take an emotional toll on you. But there's a lot you can do to overcome them, and that can help you feel better. The first visible side effect is having part or all of your breast removed. If you've had a mastectomy, you can choose to use an external prosthesis instead of, or before, breast reconstruction surgery. When you wear a breast prosthesis, you tuck it into a bra or attach it to your skin with double-sided tape. If you chose to get one: Ask your doctor for a prescription for an external prosthesis -- then usually it can be covered by insurance. Ask your oncologist for referral to a specialized store that sells external prostheses. You may also find them in some lingerie departments. Make an appointment with a breast prosthesis consultant and allow yourself about an hour to get fitted. Try a variety of them to see which feels and looks the best on you. Some chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells -- like hair follicles -- whether those cells are cancer or not. Hair loss is different for everyone, and it depends on the type of chemo you're taking. Radiation and hormonal treatments may also cause this side effect. What to expect: If you lose hair from chemo, it's likely to fall out within 1 to 2 weeks of starting treatment. It may thin or fall out almost all at once. It's common to lose hair over your whole body, not just on your head. This means you may lose eyelashes and eyebrows, as well as arm, leg, and pubic hair. You can't prevent hair loss with ice caps or other measures. But if you use a mild shampoo, soft hairbrush, or cool blow-drying, that may slightly lessen your hair loss. Sometimes hair begins to grow back even before your treatment is done. It may be thinner or a different color or texture. Tips: You can prepare for hair loss and make it easier to deal with. For example, many women find it helpful to cut their hair short before it starts falling out. This way you can avoid losing large clumps of it in the shower or waking to large amounts on the pillow. Here are some other tips that may help: Consider buying scarves, turbans, caps, or hats before your hair falls out. Ask your oncologist for a ""cranial prosthesis"" prescription to help ensure insurance coverage for a wig. Check with wig retailers and makers, your hair stylist, or the American Cancer Society to learn about wig and hair product options. Before you begin chemotherapy, match your hair texture or color to wigs. This is also a good time to have a wig styled. But if you get fitted with a wig early, know that it may fit slightly different once you lose your hair. Prepare loved ones, especially children, for how you'll look with your hair gone. It may help to involve them in choosing scarves and other products. If you choose to go bald, remember to use sunscreen on your head when in the sun. Keep your head warm in cold climates, too. Doctors call this lymphedema. It's swelling in the arm on the side where you've had breast or lymph node surgery. It can also happen after you get radiation. It's often a temporary side effect, but it can be permanent. If so, it can affect your quality of life. You can lessen its impact if you spot the symptoms of it early. Tips: Don't ignore any swelling you have in your arm. Avoid injury to the skin of an affected arm. Wear gloves when you garden or do housework. Avoid extreme water-temperature changes. Keep your arm protected from the sun. Avoid getting shots or IVs on your affected arm. Don't carry heavy handbags or wear heavy jewelry on the affected side. The swelling may affect the type of clothing you can wear. You may need an elastic compression sleeve to control swelling, along with more loose-fitting clothes. Ask your doctor for a referral to a certified lymphedema therapist. She can show you safe exercises and other techniques to help avoid or reduce swelling. You might have either during your treatment. Weight loss might be due to nausea, vomiting, or appetite changes. Weight gain is sometimes brought on by chemotherapy, or hormone therapy, which can both cause early menopause. But some other medications you may take can also cause you to put on extra pounds, as can changes in your diet and being less active. Tips: Now is not the time to diet. Eat nutritious, balanced meals to help yourself stay at a healthy weight, keep up your energy, and heal. These recommendations may help: Eat plenty of protein, but limit saturated fat, sugar, alcohol, and salt. Eat smaller meals more often throughout the day, especially if you're nauseous. Exercise to help with weight control and keep up your appetite. Exercise helps with other side effects, too, such as fatigue and depression. Ask your doctor what activity level is right for you. Find an exercise partner to help you stick with a routine. Even a few minutes a day can make a positive difference in how you feel. You might notice these after chemotherapy, radiation, or endocrine treatment. What to expect with skin changes: You may have: Redness Rash Dryness Inflammation Darkening of veins Redness from radiation and certain types of chemo may get worse if you expose your skin to the sun. Though rare, skin damage can happen if chemo drugs given through a vein ( IV) leak onto the skin. Let your doctor know about any breaks or cuts in your skin, which can become infected. Tips: Check first with your medical team before you use any skin products. This includes lotions, powders, perfumes, creams, deodorants, body oils, or home remedies. Additives in some products can worsen skin reactions. Avoid detergents with dyes and perfumes. Keep your skin clean and dry. Use a mild soap, and pat your skin dry after bathing. Use a rich moisturizer as recommended by your doctor several times a day to help with dry skin. Use sunscreen when in the sun. Wear loose-fitting, natural fabrics like cotton and silk. What to expect with nail changes: Nail beds may become darkened or discolored. Your nails may crack, split, or become rigid. Sometimes they may even lift off the nail bed. Tell your doctor if this happens. It increases the risk of infection. Tips: Cut them short to minimize splitting. Avoid artificial nails, which may increase the risk of an infection. It's OK to use nail polish, but remove it with a non-acetone-based remover, which is less drying. Use a cuticle remover cream or gel, massaging it into your nails. Don't bite or tear at your nails or cuticles. Wear gloves when you garden or do housework. Avoid professional manicures, or bring your own sanitized instruments. Limit the time you have your hands in water to lower the risk of fungal infections. Skin and nail changes usually go away when your treatment ends. The American Cancer Society has teamed up with the Personal Care Products Council and the National Cosmetology Association to create "" Look Good Feel Better."" This program teaches beauty techniques that can boost your appearance and how you feel about yourself after your cancer treatment. For more information, call 1-800-395- LOOK, or click here."
451,"A severe reaction A seizure A loss of consciousness For a severe reaction: While waiting for emergency help, inject glucagon if you are trained to do so. For moderate to mild symptoms: Give the person a high-sugar food such as: 3 to 4 glucose tablets 1/3 to 1/2 tube of glucose in gel form 1/2 cup orange juice 1/3 cup apple juice 1/4 to 1/3 cup raisins 2 large or 6 small sugar cubes in water 4 oz. to 6 oz. of regular soda, not diet 1 tablespoon of molasses, honey, or corn syrup 5 hard candies After 15 minutes, test blood sugar, if possible. If symptoms persist or blood sugar reading is below 70 mg/d L, give another high-sugar food. If the person's next meal is more than 30 minutes away, give the person a small snack, such as 1/2 sandwich, 1 oz. cheese with 4 to 6 crackers, or 1 tablespoon peanut butter with 4 to 6 crackers. If the person still doesn't feel better, go to a hospital emergency room or call 911. If you go to the hospital, doctors may give sugar intravenously."
452,"When you're taking opioid medications to relieve pain, you might feel one of these drugs' most common side effects: constipation. It can be a serious problem -- but you don't have to just grin and bear it. Treatments can give you relief and make it easier to keep taking your pain medicine. Changes to your diet and other habits may help, but some people on opioids will also need to take medications to keep their bowel movements regular. These are the first things most doctors recommend, and they're the same meds that anyone with constipation might use. Your doctor may suggest you take one before you even have the problem to prevent it. Stool softeners make hard, dry waste easier to pass out of your body. Laxatives help your bowels move the stools out. You can buy many of these treatments over the counter. Ask your doctor or a pharmacist which ones may be best for you, and how long you'll need to take them. They'll start working after a few hours or a couple of days, depending on which laxative or stool softener you use. When laxatives and stool softeners aren't enough, your doctor may prescribe a medication that's made for people who have constipation because of opioids. These meds work by blocking the effects that the drugs have on your gut: Lubiprostone ( Amitzia), a pill Methylnaltrexone ( Relistor), a shot Naldemedine ( Symproic), a pill Naloxegol ( Movantik), a pill All opioids can cause constipation, but some may have less of an effect than others. Some studies have found that fentanyl may cause less constipation than morphine. Tapentadol may also be easier on your intestines than oxycodone. Methadone may also be less constipating. Talk to your doctor about which drugs will give you the right balance of pain relief and fewer side effects. You can try options other than medicines to relieve constipation, too. Rectal suppositories are laxatives that you put inside your bottom, where they dissolve and your body absorbs their medicine. An enema is a liquid that you flush into your bottom to clean out your colon. These treatments can help, but doctors don't often recommend them since they're uncomfortable. As a last resort, your doctor or nurse may use a gloved finger to get stool out. The most important thing you can do is to talk with your doctor about your constipation and how you can feel better."
453,"Doctors don't completely understand the causes of bipolar disorder. But they've gained a greater understanding in recent years of the bipolar spectrum, which includes the elated highs of mania to the lows of major depression, along with various mood states between these two extremes. Bipolar disorder seems to often run in families and there appears to be a genetic part to this mood disorder. There is also growing evidence that environment and lifestyle issues have an effect on the disorder's severity. Stressful life events -- or alcohol or drug abuse -- can make bipolar disorder more difficult to treat. Experts believe bipolar disorder is partly caused by an underlying problem with specific brain circuits and the functioning of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Three brain chemicals -- noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine -- are involved in both brain and bodily functions. Noradrenaline and serotonin have been consistently linked to psychiatric mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. Nerve pathways within areas of the brain that regulate pleasure and emotional reward are regulated by dopamine. Disruption of circuits that communicate using dopamine in other brain areas appears connected to psychosis and schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by distortions in reality and illogical thought patterns and behaviors. The brain chemical serotonin is connected to many body functions such as sleep, wakefulness, eating, sexual activity, impulsivity, learning, and memory. Researchers believe that abnormal functioning of brain circuits that involve serotonin as a chemical messenger contribute to mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder). Many studies of bipolar patients and their relatives have shown that bipolar disorder sometimes runs in families. Perhaps the most convincing data come from twin studies. In studies of identical twins, scientists report that if one identical twin has bipolar disorder, the other twin has a greater chance of developing bipolar disorder than another sibling in the family. Researchers conclude that the lifetime chance of an identical twin (of a bipolar twin) to also develop bipolar disorder is about 40% to 70%. In more studies at Johns Hopkins University, researchers interviewed all first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder and concluded that bipolar II disorder was the most common affective disorder in both family sets. The researchers found that 40% of the 47 first-degree relatives of the bipolar II patients also had bipolar II disorder; 22% of the 219 first-degree relatives of the bipolar I patients had bipolar II disorder. However, among patients with bipolar II, researchers found only one relative with bipolar I disorder. They concluded that bipolar II is the most prevalent diagnosis of relatives in both bipolar I and bipolar II families. Studies at Stanford University that explored the genetic connection of bipolar disorder found that children with one biological parent with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder have an increased likelihood of getting bipolar disorder. In this study, researchers reported that 51% of the bipolar offspring had a psychiatric disorder, most commonly major depression, dysthymia (low-grade, chronic depression), bipolar disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). Interestingly, the bipolar parents in the study who had a childhood history of ADHD were more likely to have children with bipolar disorder rather than ADHD. In other findings, researchers report that first-degree relatives of a person diagnosed with bipolar I or II disorder are at an increased risk for major depression when compared to first-degree relatives of those with no history of bipolar disorder. Scientific findings also show that the lifetime risk of affective disorders in relatives with family members who have bipolar disorder increases, depending on the number of diagnosed relatives. Along with a genetic link to bipolar disorder, research shows that children of bipolar parents are often surrounded by significant environmental stressors. That may include living with a parent who has a tendency toward mood swings, alcohol or substance abuse, financial and sexual indiscretions, and hospitalizations. Although most children of a bipolar parent will not develop bipolar disorder, some children of bipolar parents may develop a different psychiatric disorder such as ADHD, major depression, schizophrenia, or substance abuse. Environmental stressors also play a role in triggering bipolar episodes in those who are genetically predisposed. For example, children growing up in bipolar families may live with a parent who lacks control of moods or emotions. Some children may live with constant verbal or even physical abuse if the bipolar parent is not medicated or is using alcohol or drugs. Some findings show that people with bipolar disorder have a genetic predisposition to sleep-wake cycle problems that may trigger symptoms of depression and mania. The problem for those with bipolar disorder, however, is that sleep loss may lead to a mood episode such as mania (elation) in some patients. Worrying about losing sleep can increase anxiety, thus worsening the bipolar mood disorder altogether. Once a sleep-deprived person with bipolar disorder goes into the manic state, the need for sleep decreases even more. In one study, researchers interviewed 39 bipolar patients with primarily manic or depressed episodes to determine the presence of social rhythm disruptions during the two months prior to the onset of the mood. ( A social rhythm disruption is a disturbance in daily routines such as sleeping, eating, exercising, or interacting with other people, which in turn could affect patterns of brain activity tied to mood regulation.) When comparing the results with volunteers in the control group, researchers concluded that most people with bipolar disorder experience at least one social rhythm disruption prior to a major mood episode. In addition, the researchers found that social rhythm disruption affected more bipolar patients with mania than the patients with depression. Their findings concluded that 65% of the patients with bipolar disorder had at least one disruption in their daily rhythm in the eight weeks before the onset of a manic episode. Talk to your doctor if you have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. There are several non-addictive sleep medicines available that can help resolve sleep problems. Also, cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be a helpful treatment for patients with bipolar disorder who have poor sleep or anxiety and fears about poor sleep."
454,"Dysthymia, sometimes referred to as mild, chronic depression, is less severe and has fewer symptoms than major depression. With dysthymia, the depression symptoms can linger for a long period of time, often two years or longer. Those who suffer from dysthymia can also experience periods of major depression--sometimes called ""double depression."" In modern diagnostic classification systems, dysthymia and chronic depression are now both referred to as âpersistent depressive disorders. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; World Health Organization: "" Depression.

Genes may play a role, but many affected people will not have a family history of depression, and others with family history will not have depression problems. Abnormal functioning in brain circuits or nerve cell pathways that connect different brain regions regulating mood are also thought to be involved. Major life stressors, chronic illness, medications, and relationship or work problems may also increase the chances of dysthymia in people biologically predisposed to developing depression. The symptoms of dysthymia are the same as those of major depression but fewer in number and not as intense. They include the following: Sadness or depressed mood most of the day or almost every day Loss of enjoyment in things that were once pleasurable Major change in weight (gain or loss of more than 5% of weight within a month) or appetite Insomnia or excessive sleep almost every day Being physically restless or rundown in a way that is noticeable by others Fatigue or loss of energy almost every day Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness or excessive guilt almost every day Problems with concentration or making decisions almost every day Recurring thoughts of death or suicide, suicide plan, or suicide attempt According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately1.5% of adult Americans are affected by dysthymia. While not as disabling as major depression, dysthymia can keep you from feeling your best and functioning optimally. Dysthymia can begin in childhood or in adulthood and seems to be more common in women. A mental health specialist generally makes the diagnosis based on the person's symptoms. In the case of dysthymia, these symptoms will have lasted for a longer period of time and be less severe than in patients with major depression. With dysthymia, your doctor will want to make sure that the symptoms are not a result of a physical condition, such as hypothyroidism. If you are depressed and have had depressive symptoms for more than two weeks, see your doctor or a psychiatrist. Your provider will perform a thorough medical evaluation, paying particular attention to your personal and family psychiatric history. There is no blood, X-ray or other laboratory test that can be used to diagnose dysthymia. While dysthymia is a serious illness, it's also very treatable. As with any chronic illness, early diagnosis and medical treatment may reduce the intensity and duration of symptoms and also reduce the likelihood of developing an episode of major depression. To treat dysthymia, doctors may use psychotherapy (talk therapy), medications such as antidepressants, or a combination of these therapies. Often, dysthymia can be treated by a primary care physician. Psychotherapy (or talk therapy) is used in dysthymia and other mood disorders to help the person develop appropriate coping skills for dealing with everyday life and challenging erroneous negative beliefs about oneself. Psychotherapy can also help increase adherence with medication and healthy lifestyle habits, as well as help the patient and family understand the mood disorder. You may benefit from one-on-one therapy, family therapy, group therapy, or a support group with others who live with chronic depression. There are different classes of antidepressants available to treat dysthymia. Your doctor will assess your physical and mental health, including any other medical condition, and then find the antidepressant that is most effective with the least side effects. Antidepressants may take several weeks to work fully. They should be taken for at least six to nine months after an episode of chronic depression. In addition, it sometimes may take several weeks to safely discontinue an antidepressant, so let your doctor guide you if you choose to stop the drug. Sometimes antidepressants have uncomfortable side effects. That's why you have to work closely with your doctor to find the antidepressant that gives you the most benefit with the least side effects. Getting an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment is a major step in feeling better with chronic depression. In addition, ask your doctor about the benefits of healthy lifestyle habits such as eating a well-balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and being with close friends and family members for strong social support. These positive habits are also important in improving mood and well-being. It's not uncommon for a person with dysthymia to also experience an episode ofmajor depression at the same time. This is called double depression. That's why it's so important to seek an early and accurate medical diagnosis. Your doctor can then recommend the most effective treatment to help you feel yourself again."
455,"Polycythemia vera ( PV) is a slow-growing blood cancer in which your body makes too many red blood cells. You may have it for years before you notice any symptoms. Most people find out they have PV because they had a blood test for some other reason. If your doctor thinks you have PV, you'll start with a physical exam. Then you may need: Blood tests A bone marrow test A genetic test You may not get all of these tests, but you're likely to get some of them. This helps you know for sure that you have PV and not a similar blood disease. Your doctor will probably send to you a hematologist -- a doctor who treats blood diseases. You may want to write down any questions you have so you remember them. For example, you could ask: What's the cause of my condition? What tests do I need? When will I find out about my results? How I can learn more about PV? You may also want to write some notes about how you're doing and what you've noticed. This can help you answer questions your doctor might ask, like: What symptoms are you having? How long have you had them? Do you have them some of the time or all of the time? How strong are your symptoms? Does anything make them better? Worse? At your exam, your doctor will check your body for signs of PV. She may: Check your gums for bleeding Look at your skin for redness Press on your belly to know if your spleen or liver is larger than normal Take your blood pressure to see if it's high Check your pulse Your physical exam is a starting point. It gives your doctor a better sense of what's happening with your body. Blood tests are common when checking for PV. Even if you've already had one, you may need another. Your doctor may order any of these tests: Complete blood count Blood smear Erythropoietin level Complete blood count: The complete blood count ( CBC) is often the test first that shows you might have PV. It measures: Hemoglobin. This is a protein that helps your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Hematocrit. To understand hematocrit, think of your blood as colored marbles in a jar of water. Red marbles are your red blood cells. Hematocrit is a number. It tells you how much room the red marbles take up in that jar -- or how much room your red blood cells take up in your blood. Number of blood cells. You have three kinds of blood cells: red, white, and platelets. The CBC counts how many of each you have. High numbers for hemoglobin, hematocrit, or blood cell count can all be signs of PV. The CBC takes only a few minutes. Your doctor puts a thin needle into your arm, usually near your elbow, and draws blood. You may have results in 1-2 days, but it can take longer. Blood smear: Like the CBC, a blood smear gives a blood cell count. It also shows the shape of your blood cells. This helps your doctor know if you have PV and how advanced it might be. The blood smear is a quick test. Your doctor may draw blood from your arm or by pricking your finger. You usually get the results in 1-2 days. Erythropoietin level: Erythropoietin ( EPO) is a hormone that tells your bone marrow to make new blood cells. A very low level can be another sign of PV. The EPO test is quick with a blood draw from your arm. You can get EPO test results in 2-3 days, but your lab may take longer. Bone marrow is the spongy center part of your bones that makes your blood cells. Your doctor may decide you need a bone marrow test. There are two kinds of bone marrow tests: Aspiration uses a liquid bone marrow sample Biopsy uses a solid bone marrow sample Both tests show if your bone marrow is making too many blood cells. You may get both tests done at the same time. This lasts 10-30 minutes. Your doctor first numbs an area around either your breastbone or your pelvic bone. If you feel anxious about the test, you can also get medicine to help keep you calm. Your doctor then uses a needle to take the bone marrow sample. You can get results in 3-4 days, but it may take longer. Most people with PV have a problem in a gene called JAK2. Your doctor can use a blood sample or a bone marrow sample from a biopsy to check your JAK2 gene. You can get results in 4-6 days, but your lab may take longer. If tests show that you have PV, your doctor can help you choose the best treatment for you and closely follow your health in the years to come to make sure you don't have complications. Most people with PV can live a normal life. With the right care, you can limit your symptoms and, in some cases, make them go away completely."
456,"If you just learned that you or a loved one has advanced prostate cancer, you may have many questions and concerns. By taking the time to research your condition, you've taken a good first step. Here are answers to the most common questions. After looking over these answers, click on other articles in this guide to find in-depth information about treatments, side effects, and other issues that affect you and your family. Prostate cancer is defined as ''advanced'' when it spreads outside the prostate gland. It may spread to nearby tissues, lymph nodes, bones, or other parts of the body. When it is spread beyond the tissues directly adjacent to the prostate gland, it is called metastatic prostate cancer. No cure exists for advanced prostate cancer, but treatments may greatly extend life and reduce symptoms. A look at treatments: Most prostate cancer grows in response to male hormones (androgens) in the body, such as testosterone. That's why one of the first treatments for advanced prostate cancer is to decrease these hormone levels (called androgen deprivation therapy). There are several medications that can do this, including Lupron (leuprolide), Trelstar (triptorelin), or Zoladex (goserelin). These drugs work to reduce testosterone levels to those seen in castrated patients. Other hormonal treatments include antiandrogens, estrogen- and progesterone-type drugs and cortisone derivatives. If these stop working, the drugs Zytiga (abiraterone) or Xtandi (enzalutamide) may still be effective. The most frequent side effects from hormone therapy include reduced sex drive, impotence, erectile dysfunction, infertility, and bone loss. Your doctor may be able to help prevent some side effects, such as bone loss. In the past, it was common for doctors to recommend surgical removal of the testicles to decrease hormone levels. This is usually not necessary, because medications typically work, though such medications are more expensive than the surgical procedure to remove the testes (bilateral orchiectomy). The use of medical rather than surgical treatment offers the option of stopping -- sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently -- the medicines if the side effects are intolerable, or if the patient or doctor prefers. The surgery is not reversible. If hormone therapy ultimately fails to slow the growth of the cancer, the next step may be a prostate cancer ""vaccine"" called Provenge (sipuleucel- T). Most men who take Provenge survive at least 2 years after starting the treatment. Provenge isn't your everyday vaccine. It's a therapy created by taking immune cells from a patient, genetically engineering them to fight prostate cancer, and then putting them back into the patient. It's used for men with few or no symptoms and when advanced prostate cancer no longer responds to hormone therapy. Though relatively new, Provenge appears to be remarkably safe. However, clinical trials suggested the treatment might cause a slightly increased risk of stroke. The most common side effect is chills, which occurs in most men. Other common side effects include fatigue, fever, back pain, and nausea. Chemotherapy is another option when hormone therapy stops working. Only a few chemotherapy medications have been shown to work for advanced prostate cancer. The chemotherapy drug Taxotere, when taken with the steroid prednisone, can help extend survival in some men. When Taxotere stops working, the chemotherapy drug called Jevtana (cabazitaxel) can help extend survival in some men. Possible side effects of Taxotere include nausea, hair loss, and decreased production of blood cells. Men may also develop fluid retention and pain, tingling, or numbness in the fingers or toes. Jevtana has side effects similar to Taxotere. One drug, Xofigo ( Radium -223), is approved for use in men who have advanced prostate cancer that has spread only to the bones. Candidates should have also received androgen deprivation therapy. Xofigo, given by injection once a month, works by binding to minerals within bones to deliver radiation directly to bone tumors. A study of 809 men showed that those taking Xofigo lived an average of 3 months longer than those taking a placebo. External beam radiation therapy may be used to reduce pain from bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer. Difficultly urinating if the cancer has enlarged the prostate; this can be a symptom of early or advanced disease and should prompt an evaluation by your doctor. Weakness from anemia if the prostate cancer is disrupting the production of red blood cells in bone marrow Pain, especially when the cancer has spread to the bones Fractures if bones are severely weakened Men who notice early symptoms such as difficulty urinating may have more treatment options than those who notice symptoms only after cancer has spread to the bones. Drugs called biphosphonates ( Actonel, Zometa, and others) can help make bones stronger and prevent fractures. Doctors sometimes perform surgery to support affected bones. Plus, radiation therapy directed at the bone can reduce pain caused by bone metastases. A newer noninvasive procedure uses MRI scanning to focus the energy from ultrasound in order to destroy nerve endings in the bone around the tumor. This can provide relief from bone pain with a low risk of complications. Other treatments include the use of extreme cold or electrical currents to reduce or destroy the tumor. Yes! Major organizations such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend this course of action for all cancer patients. Researchers are exploring several new ways of diagnosing, monitoring, and treating prostate cancer. Clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of these new methods and treatments. There are risks and limitations in every clinical trial. For example, you may be assigned to the ""control"" group, and not get the new medicine. In that case, the control medicine is the best therapy already available. Placebo -- or ineffective treatment -- is rarely if ever used anymore, and if it will be used in the trial, you would be informed. Keep in mind that the new medicine under investigation in the clinical trial may not work. But clinical trials also offer early access to new treatments. You can find out more about clinical trials by asking a medical oncologist, inquiring at an academic medical center, or browsing a clinical trials listing service. The National Institutes of Health lists clinical trials at www.clinicaltrials.gov."
457,"Many parts of your body -- including your eyes, brain, inner ear, and nerves in your feet and spine -- work together to keep you balanced. When a part of that system is off, you can feel dizzy. It can be a sign of something serious, and it can be dangerous if it makes you fall. Your doctor will look at all your symptoms and overall health to figure out what's going on and how to treat it. Get medical attention immediately if you're dizzy and you faint, fall, or can't walk or have any of the following: Chest pain Different or really bad headache Head injury High fever Irregular heart rate Seizures Shortness of breath Stiff neck Sudden change in speech, vision, or hearing Vomiting Weakness or numbness in your face Weakness in your leg or arm Does it feel like you're spinning or the room is moving around you? That's a classic sign of a particular type of dizziness called vertigo. It's more than feeling off-kilter and usually gets worse when you move your head. This is a symptom that there is an issue in the inner ear or part of the brainstem governing balance. The most common kind is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV. Your inner ear is a complicated system of canals filled with fluid. These let your brain know how your head is moving. With BPPV, tiny bits of calcium in part of your inner ear get loose and move to places they don't belong. The system doesn't work the way it should and sends your brain the wrong signals. It's often caused by the natural breakdown of cells that happens with age. A head injury can cause it, too. You'll feel it briefly when you tilt or turn your head, and especially when you roll over in bed or sit up. BPPV isn't serious and usually goes away on its own. If not -- or you'd like to help it along -- it can be treated with special head exercises (""particle repositioning exercises"") called the Epley maneuver to get the pieces of calcium back in place. Most people feel better after one to three treatments. There are other causes of vertigo both in and outside the brain. You can have Meniere disease (described below), labyrinthitis (described below), a tumor called an acoustic neuroma or side effects from some antibiotics. In the brain, it can be caused by a vestibular migraine, multiple sclerosis, malformations of brain structures or a stroke from lack of blood flow or bleed (hemorrhage) in the cerebellum. Inflammation of the nerves in your ears also can cause vertigo. This is called vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, and it's caused by an infection. Usually, a virus is to blame. But bacteria from a middle ear infection or meningitis can make their way into your inner ear as well. In this case, dizziness usually comes on suddenly. Your ears may ring, and it may be hard to hear. You also may be nauseated and have a fever and ear pain. Symptoms can last several weeks. If it's caused by a virus and can't be treated with antibiotics, medication can help make you feel better as the infection runs its course. This condition brings on intense periods of vertigo that can last hours. You may feel fullness or pressure in one ear. Other symptoms include ringing in your ears, hearing loss, nausea, and anxiety. You may feel exhausted after the attack passes. People with Meniere's disease have too much fluid in their inner ear. Doctors don't know what causes it, and there's no cure for it. It's usually treated with diet changes (a low-salt diet) and medicine to control the dizziness. Dizziness can be a sign of a problem with your blood flow. Your brain needs a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood. Otherwise, you can become lightheaded and even faint. Some causes of low blood flow to the brain include blood clots, clogged arteries, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat. For many older people, standing suddenly can cause a sharp drop in blood pressure. It's important to get medical help immediately if you're dizzy and faint or lose consciousness. Several drugs list dizziness as a possible side effect. Check with your doctor if you take: Antibiotics, including gentamicin and streptomycin Anti-depressants Anti-seizure medications Blood pressure medicine Sedatives Many people don't drink enough fluids to replace the liquid they lose every day when they sweat, breathe, and pee. It's particularly a problem for older people and people with diabetes. When you're severely dehydrated, your blood pressure can drop, your brain may not get enough oxygen, and you'll feel dizzy. Other symptoms of dehydration include thirstiness, tiredness, and dark urine. To help with dehydration, drink plenty of water or diluted fruit juice, and limit coffee, tea, and soda. People with diabetes need to check the amount of sugar (glucose) in their blood often. You can get dizzy if it drops too low. That also can cause hunger, shakiness, sweating, and confusion. Some people without diabetes also have trouble with low blood sugar, but that's rare. A quick fix is to eat or drink something with sugar, like juice or a hard candy. Dizziness can be a sign of many other illnesses, including: Migraines, even if you don't feel pain Stress or anxiety Nervous-system problems like peripheral neuropathy and multiple sclerosis Tumor in the brain or inner ear You may have other symptoms besides dizziness with any of these conditions. If your dizziness won't go away or impacts your ability to function, make sure to discuss it with your doctor to find out the cause and treat it."
458,"Imagine you're on a highway. An accident causes traffic to pile up ahead. Emergency crews redirect cars around the congestion. Finally, you're able to get back on the road and the route is clear. If you need heart bypass surgery, the procedure is pretty similar. A surgeon takes blood vessels from another part of your body to go around, or bypass, a blocked artery. The result is that more blood and oxygen can flow to your heart again. It can help lower your risk for a heart attack and other problems. Once you recover, you'll feel better and be able to get back to your regular activities. Bypass surgery is also known as coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG). It's the most common type of open-heart surgery in the U. S. Most people have great results and live symptom-free for a decade or more. Bypass surgery treats symptoms of coronary heart disease. That happens when a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries in your heart and blocks blood and oxygen from reaching it. You may feel things like: Chest pain, which is known as angina Irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath Coronary heart disease can lead to a heart attack. It can cause a blood clot to form and cut off blood flow. Bypass surgery can give your ticker a big health boost. A surgeon removes a blood vessel, called a graft, from another part of your body, like your chest, leg, or arm. He attaches one end of it to your aorta, a large artery that comes out of your heart. Then, he attaches the other end to an artery below the blockage. The graft creates a new route for blood to travel to your ticker. If you have multiple blockages, your surgeon may do one or more bypass procedures during the same surgery. You'll be asleep the whole time, about 3 to 6 hours on average. You'll wake up in an intensive care unit ( ICU). You'll have a tube in your mouth to help you breathe. You won't be able to talk and will feel uncomfortable. Nurses will be there to help you. They'll remove the tube after a few hours, when you can breathe on your own. You'll also be hooked up to machines that monitor your vital signs, like your heart rate and blood pressure, around the clock. You'll stay in the ICU for a few days before being moved to a hospital room. You'll stay there for about 3 to 5 days before you go home. It's a gradual process. You may feel worse right after surgery than you did before. This is normal. Your body needs time to recover, but you'll feel better each day. You won't be fully healed for about 2 months. Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions. You may not be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks. You'll visit your doctor several times during the first few months to track your progress. Call him if your symptoms don't improve or you're feeling worse. All surgeries come with the chance of problems. Some of the possible ones include: Fever Heart attack Infection and bleeding at the incision Memory loss Pain Reactions to anesthesia Stroke Once you've recovered, your symptoms of angina will be gone or much better. You'll be able to be more active, and you'll have a lower risk of getting a heart attack. Best of all, the surgery can add years to your life."
459,"Cholesterol is a fatty substance that naturally occurs in human blood. It is formed in the liver or comes from the foods you eat. Cholesterol performs important functions in your body. It aids in tissue and hormone formation. It protects your nerves. It helps with digestion. In fact, cholesterol helps form the structure of every cell in your body. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; Pixeldust Studios<br> Mayo Clinic: "" HDL cholesterol: How to boost your 'good' cholesterol.

""<br> Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health: "" Cholesterol. ""<br> Pixeldust Studios Cholesterol is essential for good health. This waxy, fat-like substance is produced naturally -- mainly in our liver. But it also comes from the food we eat -- like eggs, fatty meats, and cheese. Cholesterol is a key component for critical functions. Your skin uses cholesterol to convert sunlight into vitamin D. Some glands need it to make hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol. Cholesterol helps your liver create fat-dissolving bile acids, which help with digestion. And it's a crucial building block in every cell membrane. Cholesterol doesn't dissolve in blood -- so it needs special proteins to help move it through the bloodstream. These lipoproteins wrap themselves around cholesterol molecules -- and deliver them to where they're needed most. There are two main types: high-density lipoproteins, called HDL and low-density lipoproteins, called LDL. Most of the body's cholesterol is made up of LDL -- also known as the 'bad' cholesterol. When too much of it builds up in your bloodstream, it sticks to artery walls and helps form plaque, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. HDL is considered the 'good' kind because it acts like a scavenger -- absorbing excess cholesterol in your blood and taking it back to your liver, where it's flushed from your body. It's important to monitor your cholesterol levels regularly -- so you can help keep your HDL high and your LDL low! if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } You've probably heard your doctor talk about good and bad cholesterol. It's true we need cholesterol to maintain good health. But too much LDL -- or ""bad"" -- cholesterol and not enough HDL -- or ""good"" -- cholesterol may lead to heart disease and stroke. To help avoid these problems, you need to maintain the proper ratio between good and total cholesterol. How do you know what that ratio is? Once you know your cholesterol numbers, you can work with your doctor to find the ideal cholesterol ratio for you. Then, by making simple lifestyle changes such as eating a heart-healthy diet, exercising regularly, and taking cholesterol medications such as statins, if necessary, you can work your way toward that ratio. By lowering your level of LDL cholesterol and increasing the level of HDL cholesterol, you can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. High-density lipoprotein, or HDL, is the good cholesterol. The benefit of HDL lies in the fact that it carries bad cholesterol back to the liver. In doing so, it cleanses cholesterol from the bloodstream. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL cholesterol, is the bad cholesterol. The higher the level of LDL cholesterol, the greater your risk of a heart attack. When the level of LDL cholesterol goes up, excess cholesterol can build up and stick to the walls of your arteries. This causes damage. The buildup is called plaque, and the formation of plaque can cause arteries to harden and narrow. This hardening is called atherosclerosis. It's also known as hardening of the arteries. If a plaque becomes unstable, a blood clot can form, suddenly blocking an artery. This causes a heart attack or stroke. When your cholesterol is checked, you get a number for total cholesterol, one for the HDL level, and one for the LDL level. Your total cholesterol will be more than the sum of the HDL and LDL numbers. Either a high HDL number or a high LDL number can make your total cholesterol number high. If it's high because of a high HDL number, your health is not necessarily in danger. However, if it's high because your LDL cholesterol level is high, it's important to talk with your doctor about your health . To find your cholesterol ratio, you divide your total cholesterol number by your HDL, or good, cholesterol number. For example, if your total cholesterol number is 200 and your good cholesterol is 50, your total cholesterol ratio is 4:1. Cholesterol ratio may be used as a monitoring tool by some health care specialists. However, the AHA suggests that doctors use LDLcholesterol with patients rather than cholesterol ratio. That's because the total cholesterol number is considered a better tool for guiding the doctor in planning the best patient care and helping patients understand their health risks. Discuss with your doctor what the best numbers to monitor for you are. Triglycerides are another form of fat in the blood. Just as with HDL and LDL cholesterol, your body makes triglycerides and also gets them from foods you eat. Foods that are high in trans fats and saturated fats can raise triglyceride levels. So can simple carbohydrates and food that are hight in sugar. Also, when you eat more calories than you burn, your triglyceride levels may soar. A high cholesterol level can be a risk factor for heart attack and stroke. These devastating events happen when a cholesterol plaque ruptures. This causes blood to suddenly clot and block an artery in the heart or brain. Blockages that prevent sufficient blood flow in the coronary arteries can lead to a form of chest pain called angina. Angina is a common symptom of coronary artery disease. Symptoms usually occur with exertion and go away with rest. Yes, there are ways to manage high cholesterol levels, including the following: Increase HDL (""good"") cholesterol levels and decrease LDL (""bad"") cholesterol by getting regular aerobic exercise. Exercise also helps relax blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. Lower LDL cholesterol by eating foods low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fat. You can replace these bad fat foods with foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. This includes eating fish with omega-3 fatty acids like salmon. In addition, eating soluble fibers -- such as oats, pectin, and psyllium -- will help reduce LDL cholesterol. So will cholesterol-lowering foods, such as margarines, enriched with plant sterols and stanols. Medications such as statins help lower LDL cholesterol levels. They also help lower triglycerides and slightly increase HDL cholesterol levels. Statins reduce the risk of heart disease in many people. If your cholesterol is high, it will take time and effort to improve your cholesterol levels and cholesterol ratio. You should count on at least three months of lifestyle changes and possibly taking daily medication. The results, though -- a healthier heart and lower risk of heart attack or stroke -- are well worth the effort."
460,"Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental health condition that involves symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder like major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. In fact, many people with schizophrenia are incorrectly diagnosed at first with depression or bipolar disorder. Scientists don't know for sure if schizoaffective disorder is related mainly to schizophrenia or a mood disorder. But it's usually viewed and treated as a combination of both conditions. Only a tiny number of people get schizoaffective disorder -- .03% of the population. It's equally likely to affect men and women, but men usually get it at a younger age. Doctors can help manage it, but most people diagnosed with it have relapses. People who have it often have problems with substance use as well. There are two types. Each has some schizophrenia symptoms: Bipolar type: Episodes of mania and sometimes major depression Depressive type: Only major depressive episodes The symptoms may vary greatly from one person to the next and may be mild or severe. They may include: Delusions (false, sometimes strange beliefs that the person refuses to give up, even when they get the facts) Depression symptoms (feeling empty, sad, or worthless) Hallucinations (sensing things that aren't real, such as hearing voices) Lack of personal care (not staying clean or keeping up appearance) Mania or sudden, out-of-character jumps in energy levels or happiness, racing thoughts, or risky behavior Problems with speech and communication, only giving partial answers to questions or giving answers that are unrelated Problems with speech and communication, only giving partial answers to questions, or giving answers that are unrelated. ( The doctor may call this disorganized thinking.) Trouble at work, school, or in social settings Scientists don't know the exact cause. Risk factors for schizoaffective disorder include: Genetics: You may inherit a tendency to get features linked to schizoaffective disorder from your parents. Brain chemistry and structure: If you have schizophrenia and mood disorders, you might have problems with brain circuits that manage mood and thinking. Schizophrenia is also tied to lower levels of dopamine, a brain chemical that also helps manage these tasks. Environment: Some scientists think things like viral infections or highly stressful situations could play a part in getting schizoaffective disorder if you're at risk for it. How that happens isn't clear. Drug use: Taking mind-altering drugs. ( Your doctor may call them psychoactive or psychotropic drugs.) Schizoaffective disorder usually begins in the late teen years or early adulthood, often between ages 16 and 30. It seems to happen slightly more often in women than in men. It's rare in children. Because schizoaffective disorder combines symptoms that reflect two mental illnesses, it's easily confused with other psychotic or mood disorders. Some doctors may diagnose schizophrenia. Others may think it's a mood disorder. As a result, it's hard to know how many people actually have schizoaffective disorder. It's probably less common than either schizophrenia or mood disorders alone. There are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose schizoaffective disorder. So doctors rely on your medical history and your answers to certain questions. ( Doctors call this the clinical interview.) They also use various tests such as brain imaging (like MRI scans) and blood tests to make sure that another type of illness isn't causing your symptoms. If the doctor finds no physical cause, they may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals are trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. They use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a psychotic disorder. In order to get diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, you must have: Periods of uninterrupted illness An episode of mania, major depression, or a mix of both Symptoms of schizophrenia At least two periods of psychotic symptoms, each lasting 2 weeks. One of the episodes must happen without depressive or manic symptoms. Treatment includes: Medication: What you take depends on whether you have symptoms of depression or bipolar disorder, along with symptoms that suggest schizophrenia. The main medications that doctors prescribe for psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking are called antipsychotics. All these drugs can probably help with schizoaffective disorder, but paliperidone extended release ( Invega) is the only drug that the FDA has approved to treat it. For mood-related symptoms, you might take an antidepressant medication or a mood stabilizer. Psychotherapy: The goal of this type of counseling is to help you learn about your illness, set goals, and manage everyday problems related to the disorder. Family therapy can help families get better at relating to and helping a loved one who has schizoaffective disorder. Skills training: This generally focuses on work and social skills, grooming and self-care, and other day-to-day activities, including money and home management. Hospitalization: Psychotic episodes may require a hospital stay, especially if you're suicidal or threaten to hurt others. Electroconvulsive therapy: This treatment may be an option for adults who don't respond to psychotherapy or medications. It involves sending a quick electric current through your brain. ( You'll get a type of medicine called general anesthesia to help you sleep through it.) It causes a brief seizure. Doctors use it because they think it changes your brain chemistry and may reverse some conditions. This condition may raise your risk of: Alcohol or other substance abuse problems Anxiety disorders Conflict with family, friends, co-workers and otherss Poverty and homelessness Significant health problems Social isolation Suicide, suicide attempts, or suicidal thoughts Unemployment You can't prevent the condition. But if you're diagnosed and start treatment ASAP, it can help you avoid or ease frequent relapses and hospitalizations, and help cut the disruptions in your life, family, and friendships. Schizoaffective disorder has the features of schizophrenia, like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, along with those of a mood disorder, like mania and depression. At first, it's often misdiagnosed as one of the two. As a result, schizoaffective disorder treatment often pairs antipsychotics with antidepressants, while schizophrenia treatment centers on antipsychotics. Both conditions rely on therapy."
461,"Ataxia is a movement disorder caused by problems in the brain. When you have ataxia, you have trouble moving parts of your body the way you want. Or the muscles in your arms and legs might move when you don't want them to. The word ataxia actually means âwithout coordination.â Ataxia isn't a disorder or a disease itself -- it's a sign of other underlying disorders or diseases. Doctors have discovered anywhere from 50 to 100 different ataxias. They are grouped into categories based on what causes them, or based on which part of the body they affect. Ataxia is caused by damage to different areas of the central nervous system. Doctors categorize it by the specific part of the brain most affected, including: Cerebellar (brain) Sensory (nerves) Vestibular (ears) Your cerebellum is the part of your brain that's in charge of balance and coordination. If part of your cerebellum starts to wear away, you can develop cerebellar ataxia. Sometimes it can also affect your spinal cord. It's the most common form of ataxia. Symptoms of cerebellar ataxia include: Behavior or personality changes Changes in your voice Dizziness Fatigue Headaches Low muscle tone Muscle tremors Slurred speech Trouble walking Wide gait Sensory ataxia is the result of damage to nerves in your spinal cord or your peripheral nervous system. That is the part of your nervous system outside of the brain and spinal cord. When you have sensory ataxia, you have less sensation in your feet and legs from the nerve damage, so you have less feedback from your brain telling you where your body is in relation to the ground. It's also called proprioceptive ataxia. Symptoms of sensory ataxia include: Difficulty touching your finger to your nose with closed eyes Inability to sense vibrations Trouble walking in dim light Walking with a âheavy step,â or stomping when you walk Vestibular ataxia affects your vestibular system. This system is made up of your inner ear and ear canals, which contain fluid. They sense the movements of your head and help with your balance and spatial orientation. When the nerves in your vestibular system wear away, you can have the following problems: Blurred vision and other eye issues Nausea and vomiting Problems standing and sitting Staggering when you walk Trouble walking in a straight line Vertigo, or dizziness Around 150,000 people in the U. S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause. Genetic. You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom. Some of the specific types of genetic ataxia include: Ataxia telangiectasia Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia Dominant spastic ataxias Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCA) Episodic ataxia Friedreich's ataxia Recessive spastic ataxias Wilson's disease Acquired. Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness. Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include: Brain tumors Blood loss in the brain Cerebral palsy Chickenpox Hydrocephalus, or too much fluid buildup in the brain Head trauma Multiple sclerosis Reactions to certain cancers Vitamin E or B12 deficiency You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications, from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven't inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it's called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if he can't find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy, or MSA. Doctors haven't pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes. In order to diagnose your ataxia, your doctor will give you a physical exam. He'll check your balance and coordination, hearing, vision, reflexes, and memory. You'll also need a neurological exam, which might include an MRI or CT scan. These look at the structure of your brain for problems. For some cases, your doctor may recommend tests of your spinal fluid. To do this, he'll insert a needle into your lower back and draw out the fluid to send it to a lab for testing. To rule out genetic forms of ataxia, you may need genetic testing. But, not all genetic forms of ataxia have tests to find them. The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it's due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia. In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Counseling Physical or occupational therapy Speech therapy Support groups Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily."
462,"This is an exciting time for multiple sclerosis ( MS) research. New technologies and insights are speeding the pace of discovery. In fact, there are more MS treatments in development now than ever before. MS is a neurological disease that can cause extreme tiredness, vision changes, trouble moving, and other problems. Scientists are looking for ways to: Stop the disease from getting worse Restore lost function Prevent and cure MS Besides testing new treatments, scientists continue to explore the root causes of MS. Much of the research is still being done in animals, but recent findings and ongoing research include: Bone marrow stem cell transplants that would offer long-term benefits An epilepsy pill that slowed nerve damage A specific type of training that improved memory and brain activity (as seen on MRI scans). Changes were still in place after 6 months. An experimental therapy in mice helped their bodies make myelin, a substance that protects nerves. The treatment is a type of micro RNA, a small amount of genetic material. A large team of researchers is analyzing gut bacteria to find out what role it may play as MS gets worse. Researchers are studying children with MS to learn how their environment and genes make them more likely to get the disease. One early finding suggested low vitamin D levels were linked to MS relapses in kids with a specific gene. These are the only cells in your body with the power to create new types of cells. For example, your blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle, and bone all come from stem cells. People who need new, healthy cells to fight a disease like cancer often get bone marrow stem cell transplants. This procedure can help rebuild your immune system by producing new blood cells. You might hear your doctor call it: Stem cell transplant Bone marrow transplant HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) How does it work? Doctors remove and store cells from your body that make blood. Then, you take chemotherapy drugs to wipe out your immune system. After that, your stem cells go back in your body. They travel to your bone marrow, where they make new blood cells, giving your immune system a fresh start. Studies show that bone marrow stem cell transplants might help some people with MS. However, the treatment is still experimental. This is a kind of nanotechnology -- the study of special particles that are much smaller than your naked eye can see. Nanoparticles could lead to major breakthroughs in treating and diagnosing diseases, including MS. Treatment. In some cases, nanoparticles act as tiny cargo ships that carry medicine -- sometimes, to parts of the body drugs can't reach on their own. For example, they can cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of cells that protect your brain from possible danger -- but that also keep helpful MS drugs from getting through. Attaching MS drugs to nanoparticles may solve this problem. That's because certain nanoparticles can interact with blood-brain barrier cells and get âswallowedâ by them. When the nanoparticle gets in, so does the drug it carries. Another type of nanoparticle doesn't even need to carry medicine. The material itself is a powerful antioxidant that crosses the blood-brain barrier. It's called a cerium oxide nanoparticle, and it helped relieve some MS symptoms in mice. Diagnosis. Nanoparticles can improve imaging tests. That helps doctors get a clearer picture of what's happening inside your body. For example, a doctor can inject them into your body, so they can âlight upâ tiny areas of your brain on MRI scans. This helps her spot MS activity and damage earlier in the disease and makes it easier to keep tabs on treatments as you go along. Nanomedicine research is still in the early stages. Most studies on its potential for MS are in animals. But there's a real need and demand for new ways to attack MS, and nanomedicine is likely to play a role."
463,"A tiny parasite called Giardia intestinalis causes this diarrheal disease. This bug lives all around the world in places that don't have clean drinking water. It's a common cause of waterborne illness in the U. S. Usually from the stool of an infected person or animal. Before they're pooped out, the parasites grow a hard shell called a cyst. It helps them live for months outside the body, either in water or on a surface. The infection comes after you encounter the parasite or a cyst. You might: Touch contaminated surfaces like bathroom handles, changing tables, diaper pails, or toys, then eat without washing your hands Drink water or use ice made from an untreated water source -- like a lake, stream, or well -- that's home to giardia Swallow the parasite while you swim or play in water Eat uncooked food that contains giardia Come into close contact with someone who has giardiasis Travel to countries where it's common While anyone can catch giardiasis, some people are more likely than others to get the infection: Parents and child care workers who change diapers Children in child care centers People who live in the same household as someone with giardiasis Those who drink water or use ice made from untreated water Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unsafe water or who don't practice good hygiene (like proper handwashing) on the trail International travelers People who have anal sex There isn't a vaccine, but there are steps you can take: Wash your hands after you use the toilet, after you change diapers, and before you eat or prepare food. Filter or boil water if you're outdoors. Try not to swallow water when you swim in a pool, lake, or stream. Drink bottled water when you travel to places with unsafe water. Use a condom if you have anal sex. They usually start 1 to 3 weeks after you're exposed. They'll probably last for 2 to 6 weeks. The most common include: Diarrhea Gas or flatulence Greasy stool that floats Stomach or abdominal cramps Upset stomach or nausea Dehydration Weight loss Let your doctor know if: Your symptoms -- including loose stools and nausea -- last more than a week You show signs of dehydration, such as extreme thirst, dizziness, or confusion Tell her about any recent travels, interactions with children in diapers, or swimming or drinking from a body of water. She'll collect a series of stool samples over several days to make a diagnosis. Many people get better without treatment. But if your symptoms last more than several weeks, or you're likely to spread the parasite, your doctor can give you medication. Metronidazole ( Flagyl), nitazoxanide ( Alinia), and tinidazole ( Tindamax) are among the drugs used to treat giardia infections."

But the symptoms of LPR are often different than those that are typical of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD). With LPR, you may not have the classic symptoms of GERD, such as a burning sensation in your lower chest (heartburn). That's why it can be difficult to diagnose and why it is sometimes called silent reflux. At either end of your esophagus is a ring of muscle (sphincter). Normally, these sphincters keep the contents of your stomach where they belong -- in your stomach. But with LPR, the sphincters don't work right. Stomach acid backs up into the back of your throat (pharynx) or voice box (larynx), or even into the back of your nasal airway. It can cause inflammation in areas that are not protected against gastric acid exposure. Silent reflux is common in infants because their sphincters are undeveloped, they have a shorter esophagus, and they lie down much of the time. The cause in adults is not known. Symptoms in infants and children may include: Hoarseness "" Barking"" or chronic cough Reactive airway disease (asthma) Noisy breathing or pauses in breathing (apnea) Trouble feeding, spitting up, or inhaling food Trouble gaining weight With LPR, adults may have heartburn or a bitter taste or burning sensation in the back of the throat. But they are less likely to have such classic signs of GERD. More often, symptoms in adults are vague and may be easily confused with other problems. The most common symptoms include: Excessive throat clearing Persistent cough Hoarseness A ""lump"" in the throat that doesn't go away with repeated swallowing Other symptoms may include: A sensation of postnasal drip or excess throat mucus Trouble swallowing Trouble breathing Sore throat Stomach acid that pools in the throat and larynx can cause long-term irritation and damage. Without treatment, it can be serious. In infants and children, LPR can cause: Narrowing of the area below the vocal cords Contact ulcers Recurrent ear infections from problems with eustachian tube function Lasting buildup of middle ear fluid In adults, silent reflux can scar the throat and voice box. It can also increase risk for cancer in the area, affect the lungs, and may irritate conditions such as asthma, emphysema, or bronchitis. Although silent reflux is harder to diagnose than GERD, a doctor can diagnose it through a combination of a medical history, physical exam, and one or more tests. Tests may include: An endoscopic exam, an office procedure that involves viewing the throat and vocal cords with a flexible or rigid viewing instrument p H monitoring, which involves placing a small catheter through the nose and into the throat and esophagus; here, sensors detect acid, and a small computer worn at the waist records findings during a 24-hour period. Newer p H probes placed in the back of your throat or capsules placed higher up in the esophagus may be used to better identify reflux. Silent reflux treatment for infants and children may include: Smaller and more frequent feedings Keeping an infant in a vertical position for at least 30 minutes after feeding Medications such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors, as directed by the pediatrician Surgery for any abnormalities that can't be treated in other ways Silent reflux treatment for adults may include these lifestyle modifications: Lose weight, if needed. Quit smoking, if you are a smoker. Avoid alcohol. Restrict chocolate, mints, fats, citrus fruits, carbonated beverages, spicy or tomato-based products, red wine, and caffeine. Stop eating at least three hours before going to bed. Elevate the head of the bed about 4 to 6 inches. Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes around the waist. Try chewing gum to increase saliva and neutralize acid. You may also need to take one or more types of medicine such as: Proton pump inhibitors such as rabeprazole ( Aciphex), dexlansoprazole ( Dexilant), esomeprazole ( Nexium), lansoprazole ( Prevacid), omeprazole ( Prilosec), or omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate ( Zegerid) to reduce gastric acid. H2 blockers such as nizatidine ( Nizatidine), famotidine ( Pepcid), cimetidine ( Tagamet), or ranitidine ( Zantac) to reduce gastric acid. Prokinetic agents to increase the forward movement of the GI tract and increase the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. These medications are not as commonly used, because they have been linked to adverse effects on heart rhythm and diarrhea. Sucralfate to help protect injured mucous membranes. Antacids to help neutralize acid; these are used more commonly for symptoms of heartburn. Some people respond well to self-care and medical management. However, others need more aggressive and lengthy treatment. If this is not effective or if symptoms recur, your doctor may suggest surgery. Fundoplication is a type of surgery which involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus to create a stronger valve between the esophagus and stomach. It is usually done laparoscopically, with small surgical incisions and use of small surgical equipment and a laparoscope to help the surgeon see inside. Fundoplication can also be done as a traditional open surgery with a larger incision. Other techniques can also be done laparoscopically, including placing a ring of titanium beads around the outside of the lower esophagus that strengthens the valve while still letting food pass through."
465,"If you have symptoms of sleep apnea, your doctor may ask you to have a sleep apnea test, called a polysomnogram. This may be done in a sleep disorder center or even at home. A polysomnogram -- or sleep study -- is a multiple-component test that electronically transmits and records specific physical activities while you sleep. The recordings are analyzed by a qualified sleep specialist to determine whether or not you have sleep apnea or another type of sleep disorder. If sleep apnea is determined, you may be asked to do further sleep testing in order to determine the best treatment option. On the night of your sleep study if you are in a sleep center lab, you will be assigned to a private bedroom in the sleep center or hospital. Near the bedroom will be a central monitoring area, where the technicians monitor sleeping patients. You will be hooked up to equipment that may look uncomfortable. However, most people fall asleep with little difficulty. Similar, more portable equipment is now available for home testing, especially for less complicated cases or situations. During a sleep study, surface electrodes will be put on your face and scalp and will send recorded electrical signals to the measuring equipment. These signals, which are generated by your brain and muscle activity, are then recorded digitally. Belts will be placed around your chest and abdomen to measure your breathing. A bandage-like oximeter probe will be put on your finger to measure the amount of oxygen in your blood. EEG (electroencephalogram) to measure and record brain wave activity. EMG (electromyogram) to record muscle activity such as face twitches, teeth grinding, and leg movements, and to determine the presence of REM stage sleep. During REM sleep, intense dreams often occur as the brain undergoes heightened activity. EOG (electro-oculogram) to record eye movements. These movements are important in determining the different sleep stages, particularly REM stage sleep. ECG (electrocardiogram) to record heart rate and rhythm. Nasal airflow sensor to record airflow. Snore microphone to record snoring activity."
466,"There are three major types of hepatitis in the U. S. -- A, B, and C. Each one affects your liver, an organ in your belly that's about the size of a football. They're all contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself. The main way you get sick is when you eat or drink something that has the hep A virus in it. A lot of times this happens in a restaurant. If an infected worker there doesn't wash his hands well after using the bathroom, and then touches food, he could pass the disease to you. Food or drinks you buy at the supermarket can sometimes cause the disease, too. The ones most likely to get contaminated are: Fruits and vegetables Shellfish Ice and water You could catch or spread it if you're taking care of a baby and you don't wash your hands after changing his diaper. This can happen, for example, at a day care center. Another way you can get hep A is when you have sex with someone who has it. The virus that causes it lives in blood, semen, and some other fluids in your body. You usually catch it by having sex with someone who's infected. You can also get it by using the same razor or toothbrush as someone who has hepatitis B. Sharing needles and syringes to inject illegal drugs can also give you the disease. Another way to get sick is if you touch the open sores of somebody who's infected. And if you have the disease when you're pregnant you can pass it to your baby. You catch it when blood from someone who's infected gets in your body. This happens if you share needles to take illegal drugs. It's less common, but you can also get sick if you: Share a razor or toothbrush with someone who's infected Have sex with somebody who has hepatitis C It's rare, but if you're pregnant and have the disease, it's possible to pass it to your newborn. There are some myths out there about how you get hepatitis C, so let's set the record straight. It's not spread by food and water (like hep A). And you can't spread it by doing any of these things: Kissing Hugging Sneezing or coughing Sharing forks, knives, or spoons For hepatitis A, one of the best things you can do is wash your hands a lot. That will keep the virus out of food and drinks. If you have hepatitis B and C, you need to find ways to keep others from making contact with your blood. Follow these tips: Cover your cuts or blisters. Carefully throw away used bandages, tissues, tampons, and sanitary napkins. Don't share your razor, nail clippers, or toothbrush. If your blood gets on objects, clean them with household bleach and water. Don't breastfeed if your nipples are cracked or bleeding. Don't donate blood, organs, or sperm. If you inject drugs, don't share needles or other equipment. There are vaccines that prevent hepatitis A and B. So far there isn't one for hepatitis C, but researchers are working on it. The CDC recommends that all children get hepatitis A and B vaccines. Adults should get vaccinated if they travel to a country where there are outbreaks or if they're at high risk for the disease. Hepatitis A. The symptoms usually show up 2 to 6 weeks after the virus entered your body. They usually last for less than 2 months, though sometimes you can be sick for as long as 6 months. Some warning signs that you may have the disease are: Fever Fatigue Nausea, vomiting, or pain in your belly Dark urine or clay-colored bowel movements Pain in your joints Yellowing of your skin or eyes (jaundice) Some people get the disease but don't have any symptoms, though. Hepatitis B. The symptoms are the same as hepatitis A, and you usually get them 3 months after you're infected. They could show up, though, anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months later. Sometimes the symptoms are mild and last just a few weeks. For some people, the hep B virus stays in the body and leads to long-term liver problems. Hepatitis C. The early symptoms are the same as hepatitis A and B, and they usually happen 6 to 7 weeks after the virus gets in your body. But you could notice them anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months later. For about 25% of people who get hep C, the virus goes away on its own without treatment. In other cases, it sticks around for years. When that happens, your liver might get damaged. Remember, it's possible to spread all the types of hepatitis even if you don't show any signs of being sick. The hepatitis A virus is strong and can survive outside the body for months. It can even make it through freezing temperatures. But you may be able to kill it by boiling or cooking foods or liquids for at least a minute. Hepatitis B sticks around on things like tables, razor blades, and blood stains for about a week. Hepatitis C remains on surfaces at room temperature for up to 3 weeks. Since you might not have any symptoms after being infected, don't wait until you feel sick. Contact your doctor if you think you've been in any of the situations that could lead to hepatitis. For instance, call if you: Ate in a restaurant where there was an outbreak of hepatitis A Had sex with someone who has hepatitis Share needles when injecting illegal drugs"
467,"Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications. These drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. TD causes stiff, jerky movements of your face and body that you can't control. You might blink your eyes, stick out your tongue, or wave your arms without meaning to do so. Not everyone who takes an antipsychotic drug will get it. But if it happens, it's sometimes permanent. So if you have movements you can't control, let your doctor know right away. To ease your symptoms, your doctor may: Lower the dose Add another medication to what you're taking to act as an antidote Switch you to a different drug Tardive dyskinesia causes stiff, jerky movements that you can't control. They include: Orofacial dyskinesia or oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia: Uncontrolled movements in your face -- namely your lips, jaw, or tongue. You might: Stick out your tongue without trying Blink your eyes fast Chew Smack or pucker your lips Puff out your cheeks Frown Grunt Dyskinesia of the limbs: It can also affect your arms, legs, fingers, and toes. That can cause you to: Wiggle your fingers Tap your feet Flap your arms Thrust out your pelvis Sway from side to side These movements can be fast or slow. You may find it hard to work and stay active. Antipsychotic meds treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other brain conditions. Doctors also call them neuroleptic drugs. They block a brain chemical called dopamine. It helps cells talk to each other and makes the muscles move smoothly. When you have too little of it, your movements can become jerky and out of control. You can get TD if you take an antipsychotic drug. Usually you have to be on it for 3 months or more. But there have been rare cases of it after a single dose of an antipsychotic medicine. Older versions of these drugs are more likely to cause this problem than newer ones. Some studies find a similar risk from both types, though. Antipsychotic medications that can cause tardive dyskinesia include older antipsychotics like: Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine) Fluphenazine ( Prolixin) Haloperidol ( Haldol) Thioridazine ( Mellaril) Trifluoperazine ( Stelazine) Your chances of getting TD go up the longer you take an antipsychotic medicine. Some drugs that treat nausea, reflux, and other stomach problems can also cause TD if you take them for more than 3 months. These include: Metoclopramide ( Reglan) Prochlorperazine ( Compazine) You're more likely to get it if you: Are a woman who has gone through menopause Are over age 55 Abuse alcohol or drugs Are African- American or Asian- American TD can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms might not appear until months or years after you start taking antipsychotic medicine. Or you might first notice the movements after you've already stopped taking the drug. The timing can make it hard to know whether the medicine caused your symptoms. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS): If you take medicine for mental health conditions, your doctor should check you at least once a year to make sure you don't have TD. He can give you a physical exam called the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, which will help him rate any abnormal movements. He can also do tests to find out whether you have another disorder that causes abnormal movements, like: Cerebral palsy Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease Stroke Tourette's syndrome To rule out these conditions, you may get: Blood tests Imaging scans of the brain, such as a CT or MRI scan The goal is to prevent TD. When your doctor prescribes a new drug to treat a mental health disorder, ask about its side effects. The benefits of the drug should outweigh the risks. If you have movement problems, tell your doctor but don't stop taking the drug on your own. Your doctor can take you off the medicine that caused the movements, or lower the dose. You might need to switch to a newer antipsychotic drug that may be less likely to cause TD. There are two FDA-approved medicines to treat tardive dyskinesia: Valbenazine ( Ingrezza) Deutetrabenazine ( Austedo) Both of these medicines work in similar ways to regulate the amount of dopamine flow in brain areas that control certain kinds of movements. Both can sometimes cause drowsiness. Austedo also has been shown to sometimes cause depression when used in patients with Huntington's disease. There's no proof that natural remedies can treat it, but some might help with movements: Ginkgo biloba Melatonin Vitamin B6 Vitamin E Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements for your symptoms."
468,"If you have Gaucher disease, or your child does, the way it feels can vary depending on the person and type of Gaucher disease. You and your doctor will be able to choose the best treatment once you figure out which kind you've got. There are three main forms of the disease: types 1, 2, and 3. No matter which kind it is, the reason you have Gaucher is that you were born with a change in one of your genes called a mutation. This causes a certain fat to build up in organs like your bone marrow, liver, spleen, or nervous system, and leads to a variety of symptoms that range from mild to very serious. It's the most common form. You may hear your doctor call it non-neuronopathic Gaucher. Type 1 symptoms can sometimes be mild. Some people may never notice it. Others may have more severe problems. Your symptoms can crop up at any age, from childhood to adulthood. Some that you may get are: Enlarged liver or spleen Anemia (low red blood cell levels), which can make you tired Low levels of blood platelets, which can make you bruise or bleed easily Arthritis Osteoporosis (weak bones that break easily) Bone pain Lung disease This form of the disease is much more serious than type 1. It first shows up in infants, usually at age 3 to 6 months. If your baby has this kind of Gaucher, you'll need to get lots of support from family and friends. Infants with this type often don't live past age 2. Reach out to those you love who can give you the emotional backing you need. You can also ask your doctor about how to get counseling or where you can meet other parents who are going through the same thing. Type 2 affects the central nervous system. You can usually expect some of these symptoms in your child: Enlarged spleen Can't swallow Abnormal eye movements Doesn't gain weight Pneumonia Throat muscle spasms Collodion skin, which looks like a thin, shiny coating Slow heart rate Stops in breathing, or apnea Infections Lung problems Seizures Brain damage Bluish skin This kind of Gaucher also affects the central nervous system, and like type 2, it can also start in childhood, but usually at a later age. There are three varieties of type 3 Gaucher: 3a, 3b, and 3c. But these forms sometimes overlap in symptoms. Type 3b may cause liver or spleen problems earlier. You'll want plenty of help if your child has type 3 -- from family and friends and also health care professionals. Your youngster may feel very ill and may need help to eat or get extra nutrition. As type 3 symptoms get worse, your child may need help to dress, bathe, or get around the house. Type 3 has the same blood and bone problems that other forms of Gaucher disease do, and it can also cause these symptoms in your child: Hard to move eyes side to side or up and down Lung disease that gets worse over time Mental ability slowly breaks down Problems controlling arms and legs Muscle spasms or shocks Type 3c is also called cardiovascular Gaucher disease. It's a rare type that mostly affects your heart. Signs of this form usually show up in childhood. The most common symptom is hardened heart values. Cardiovascular Gaucher may also cause these symptoms in kids: Eye problems Bone pain Bones break easily Mildly enlarged spleen Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease is another type. It's the most severe form of the disease. An infant with this type may only live a few days. Signs of perinatal lethal Gaucher are: Skin swelling from fluid buildup Dry, scaly skin called ichthyosis Enlarged liver or spleen Severe brain problems Swollen stomach Unusual facial features No matter which type you or child has, talk to your doctor about how to get the right treatment. Ask him where to find support groups in your area, where you can meet others who can share their experiences and give advice on how to get the resources you need.

469,"These nine tips can help you guard your joints against injury andkeep them healthy for years to come. A joint is the connection between two bones. Joints and their surrounding structures allow you to bend your elbows and knees, wiggle your hips, bend your back, turn your head, and wave your fingers to say bye-bye. Smooth tissue called cartilage and synovium and a lubricant called synovial fluid cushion the joints so bones do not rub together. But increasing age, injury,or carrying too much weight can wear and tear your cartilage. This can lead to a reaction that can damage your joints and lead to arthritis. The best way to care for your joints is to keep them and your muscles, ligaments, and bones strong and stable. Here are some tips for good joint health. Keeping your weight within a healthy range is the best thing you can do for your joints. Weight-bearing joints, such as your knees, hips, and back, have to support some, if not all, of your body weight. That's why so many overweight people have problems with these areas of the body. The higher the number on your bathroom scale, the more wear and tear you put on your joints. Losing weight reduces pressure on your knees, hips, and back and helps prevent joint injury. Research has shown that with every pound gained, a person puts four times more stress on the knees. Exercise can help you lose extra pounds and maintain a healthy weight. Some research suggests that aerobic exercise -- activities that get your heart rate up -- can reduce joint swelling. If your joints bother you, opt for exercises that won't give your joints a pounding. Instead of step aerobics, try low-impact exercises such as swimming or bicycling. Another healthy idea: Don't sit still! Couch potatoes, computer addicts, and all who remain glued to a chair all day long have a high risk for joint pain. Less movement means more stiffness in your joints. So get up and get moving. Change positions frequently. Take frequent breaks at work, and stretch or go for a short walk. If you can't leave the office, try taking phone calls while standing. Strong muscles support your joints. If you don't have enough muscle, your joints take a pounding, especially your spine, hips, and knees, which must support your entire body weight. Weight training exercises help build muscle and keep your muscles and surrounding ligaments strong. That way, your joints don't have to do all the work. A certified personal trainer can show you the best exercises for healthy joints and how to do them correctly. Doing them incorrectly increases the chance of injury. Make sure your exercise routine includes activities that strengthen your core. That includes your chest, back, and abdomen. Stronger abs and back muscles help you keep your balance and prevent falls that can damage your joints. Certain exercises and activities might just be too tough for your joints to handle at first. Go slow. Modify exercises that cause joint pain. Ask a trainer, physical therapist, or coach to help you with modifications. You will likely feel some muscle pain after working out for a few days, especially the second and third day. Listen to your body, and learn the difference between ""threatening pain"" and good muscle-building pain. Slouching is not good for your joints. Standing and sitting up straight protect your joints from your neck to your knees. Good posture also helps guard your hip joints and back muscles. Posture is also important when lifting and carrying. For example, if you use a backpack, be sure to put it over both shoulders instead of slinging it over one. Being lopsided puts more stress on your joints. When lifting, use the biggest muscles in your body by bending at your knees instead of bending your back. Make sure you always wear a helmet, knee pads, and elbow and wrist pads when taking part in high-risk activities, including work-related ones such as repetitive kneeling or squatting. Even if you think you're a pro on a bicycle or on a pair of Rollerblades, you should never go without safety gear. Hit the wrong bump in the road, and you could be headed for a lifetime of trouble. Serious injuries or several minor injuries can damage cartilage. Injuries can lead to long-term joint problems. Elbow and wrist braces, or guards, also help reduce stress on your joints during activities. Ice is a great drug-free pain reliever. It helps relieve joint swelling and numbs pain. If you have a sore joint, apply ice wrapped in a towel or a cold pack to the painful area for no more than 20 minutes. Don't have ice or a cold pack? Try wrapping a bag of frozen vegetables (peas work best!) in a light towel. Never apply ice directly to the skin. Eating a healthy diet is good for your joints, because it helps build strong bones and muscles. For your bones, make sure you get enough calcium every day. You can do this by eating foods such as milk, yogurt, broccoli, kale, figs, and fortified foods like soy or almond milk. If those foods don't tempt your taste buds, ask your doctor if calcium supplements are right for you. For your muscles, you need to get enough protein. Exactly how much you need depends on your age, sex, and how active you are. Most Americans get enough protein. Good sources include lean meats, seafood, beans, legumes, soy products, and nuts. Go for a variety. You also need vitamin D to keep your bones and joints in good health. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium from the foods you eat. Dairy products. many cereals, soy milk, and almond milk are fortified with vitamin D. You can ask your doctor about the proper amount of vitamin D and ways you can get it. Oranges may also give your joints a healthy boost. Some studies suggest that vitamin C and other antioxidants can help keep your joints healthy."
470,"Toxic shock syndrome is a sudden, potentially fatal condition. It's caused by the release of toxins from an overgrowth of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus, or staph, which is found in many women's bodies. Toxic shock syndrome affects menstruating women, especially those who use super-absorbent tampons. The body responds with a sharp drop in blood pressure that deprives organs of oxygen and can lead to death. This disease made headlines in the late 1970s and early 1980s after the deaths of several young women who were using a brand of super-absorbent tampon that was later removed from the market. Toxic shock syndrome is still mostly a disease of menstruating women who use tampons. But it has also been linked to the use of menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps. A woman who has recently given birth also has a higher chance of getting toxic shock. And it can happen to men and women who have been exposed to staph bacteria while recovering from surgery, a burn, an open wound, or the use of a prosthetic device. More than a third of all cases of toxic shock involve women under 19, and up to 30% of women who have had the disease will get it again. If you have ever had toxic shock, you must look out for the symptoms so you can get immediate medical care. People who die from toxic shock are killed by the body's response to the toxins released by staph bacteria. Most people suffer hypotensive shock, in which the heart and lungs stop working. If you are menstruating and have a high fever with vomiting, especially if you have been using tampons, you must get medical help right away. If you are using a tampon, menstrual sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap when you become ill, remove it immediately, even before calling your doctor. Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a poison produced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This bacteria is one of several staph bacteria that cause skin infections in burn patients and hospital patients who have had surgery. Staph is normally -- and harmlessly -- present in the vagina. How staph causes toxic shock syndrome is not understood. But two conditions are necessary: First, the bacteria need an environment in which they can grow rapidly and release poisons. Then the poisons must get into the bloodstream. A tampon saturated with blood is a supportive place for rapid growth of bacteria. It also seems to matter what the tampon is made of. Polyester foam provides a better environment for the growth of bacteria than either cotton or rayon fibers. In cases from menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps, either the device had been in the vagina for a long time -- more than 30 hours -- or, in the case of the sponge, pieces of the sponge remained in the vagina. The way in which bacterial poisons enter the bloodstream may also be related to tampon use. Sliding a tampon into place in the vagina may make microscopic tears in the walls of the vagina, rupturing tiny blood vessels. A super-absorbent tampon -- especially if it's left in place too long, or if it is used when the menstrual flow is light -- can dry out the vagina, making such tearing even more likely. Researchers investigating the causes of toxic shock syndrome have ruled out feminine deodorant sprays and douches, underwear, and other clothing. The condition is also unrelated to the woman's menstrual history, drug or alcohol use, cigarette smoking, swimming or bathing, or sexual activity."
471,"After the hot, humid days of summer, the colder temperatures in the fall and winter can come as a shock to our bodies. If you have a condition like multiple sclerosis ( MS), cold temps can make your symptoms worse and make you flat-out uncomfortable. You might find that it's harder to move your limbs, you get more muscle spasms than normal, or your muscles feel tighter. Doctors aren't sure why cold temperatures make MS symptoms worse. But they think that the condition can alter the way you feel temperature changes. If your symptoms get worse in cold weather, it's usually for short time. A few simple tips can help you stay comfortable and warm in the fall and winter. Try to get moving. When you have MS, there may be times when you find you can't move around as easily as you'd like. When you can, try to get some moderate physical activity like walking or stretching. It'll help you burn energy and warm up. Dress in layers. This will help keep you warm. And if you get too hot, you can easily remove layers and stay comfortable. When it's very cold, it's a good idea to wear hats, thick socks, or lined boots. This will keep heat from escaping through your head or feet. Keep your hands and feet warm. Doctors believe that MS can cause blood vessels in your hands and feet to overreact to cold temperatures. If you have MS, you may also be at risk for Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition in which your fingers and toes lose heat. They turn from white to blue to red as the blood begins flowing again. You may feel numbness, pain, or like someone is sticking you with pins and needles. To protect your hands and feet from the effects of the cold, try wearing hand warmers or using a heating pad. But don't place the heating pad directly on your skin. It could cause burns or blisters. Warm your insides. The easiest way to do this is to eat hot meals like soup. You can also sip hot drinks like tea or coffee. Pour them into an insulated mug to keep them warm longer and help limit your trips to the kitchen. Get some sunshine. Even on crisp fall and cold winter days, who doesn't love the feeling of sunshine on their shoulders? Step outside and soak up some rays. You'll warm up, and you'll help your body make some much-needed vitamin D. An added benefit? A little sunshine might help boost your mood."
472,"If you think you have allergies, think about seeing a doctor who can tell you whether you do or not. An allergist is an MD who specializes in treating allergic conditions. An allergist can tell you what you're allergic to and how to avoid your triggers. You may want to make an appointment if: You have symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, cough, or watery eyes that last for more than three months and make it hard for you to work or sleep. You've tried over-the-counter drugs and still need more relief. You get a lot of sinus infections, headaches, stuffy nose, or ear infections. You snore or have trouble staying asleep. You have other health problems such as heart disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, glaucoma, high blood pressure, enlarged prostate, liver disease, or kidney disease. If you do, it may not be safe to treat allergies on your own with over-the-counter drugs. Talk to your doctor before you take them. Children and older people with allergies should always see a doctor before treatment starts. Confirm you have allergies. Only a doctor can tell you for sure whether you have an allergy. You may have something else, such as an infection. When you know what you have, you can get the right treatment. Find your triggers. If you know what you're allergic to and what things trigger a reaction, you can take steps to avoid those things. An allergist will give you tests to help you identify specifically what triggers your allergies Make a treatment plan. A treatment plan will help you know what you need to do. It should include what kind of medicine to take and when to take it, what things you need to avoid because of your allergies, and how to be ready for and what to do if you have a serious allergic reaction. Check that you have the right medicine. Over-the-counter drugs can often help with allergies. Some people, though, also need prescription medicine to handle the symptoms. Your doctor can advise you about your medicines and make sure you have the prescriptions you need. Control your symptoms. Your doctor can help you tame your runny nose and itchy eyes and even stop an allergic reaction before it starts."
473,"Probiotics are a type of ""good"" bacteria found in some foods and supplements. We usually think of bacteria as something that can cause diseases or other problems. But probiotics can help keep your gut healthy. Your body doesn't need probiotics. You already have healthy bacteria in your gut. But it usually doesn't hurt to take them, and adding them to your diet might help. They might lower the number of ""bad"" bacteria in your gut that can cause illness or inflammation. They can also replace those problem germs with good or helpful bacteria. Researchers are studying when and how probiotics might best help. There's more research for some illnesses than others. They might help people with: Diarrhea , especially when it's linked to specific antibiotics. Probiotics also might help with infectious diarrhea, especially in children. Inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some probiotics might keep ulcerative colitis in remission (a state of little to no disease activity) and prevent Crohn's disease from relapsing and getting worse. Irritable bowel syndrome . Probiotics can sometimes help ease symptoms, including stomach pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. Probiotics also are being studied for many other conditions. There isn't as much research yet, but some people say that probiotics have helped them with: Preventing and treating yeast infections Preventing and treating urinary tract infections Lactose intolerance Skin conditions such as eczema Treating certain stomach and respiratory infections, especially in children Treating allergies and asthma Decreasing inflammation, such as from rheumatoid arthritis Because these good bacteria already exist in the body, they're considered safe for most people. But there are some things to consider. They can trigger an allergic reaction. They might cause mild stomach problems, especially the first few days you start taking them. You might have stomach upset, gas, diarrhea, or bloating. Those symptoms usually go away after your body gets used to them. If you have an immune system problem or another serious health condition, you may have a greater chance of issues. Some reports have linked probiotics to serious infections and other side effects. The people most likely to have trouble are those with immune system problems, people who've had surgery, and others who are critically ill. Don't take probiotics if you have any of those issues. Always talk to your pediatrician before giving probiotic supplements to your child. If you're pregnant or nursing, you should also talk to your doctor before you try one. Most probiotics in the U. S. are sold as dietary supplements. That means the companies that make them don't have to test their products and show that they work or that they are safe. More research is needed to confirm that probiotics are safe and effective. Ask your doctor which probiotics are the right ones for you. Be sure to stop taking them if you have any problems."
474,"There are a number of different drugs your dentist may prescribe, depending on your condition. Some medications are prescribed to fight certain oral diseases, to prevent or treat infections, or to control pain and relieve anxiety. Here you will find a description of the most commonly used drugs in dental care. The dose of the drugs and instructions on how to take them will differ from patient to patient, depending on what the drug is being used for, patient's age, weight, and other considerations. Even though your dentist will provide information to you about any medication he or she may give to you, make sure you fully understand the reasons for taking a medication and inform your dentist of any health conditions you have. Local anesthesia, general anesthesia, nitrous oxide, or intravenous sedation is commonly used in dental procedures to help control pain and anxiety. Other pain relievers include prescription or nonprescription anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen ( Tylenol), anesthetics and topical analgesics. Anti-inflammatory drugs Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that are used to relieve the discomfort and redness of mouth and gum problems. Corticosteroids are available by prescription only and are available as pastes under such brand names as Kenalog in Orabase, Orabase- HCA, Oracort, Oralone, Lidex, Temovate and others. Your dentist may recommend a nonprescription anti-inflammatory drug -- such as Motrin -- to relieve mild pain and/or swelling caused by dental appliances, toothaches, and fevers. Tylenol may also be given. Note: Unless directed by your dentist, never give infants and children aspirin. Topical Analgesics Dental analgesics are used in the mouth to relieve pain or irritation caused by many conditions, including toothache and sores in or around the mouth (such as cold sores, canker sores, and fever blisters). Also, some of these medicines are used to relieve pain or irritation caused by dentures or other dental appliances, including braces. Analgesics are available either by prescription or over-the-counter and come in many dosage forms, including aerosol spray, dental paste, gel, lozenges, ointments, and solutions. Dental analgesics are contained in such brand name products as Ambesol, Chloraseptic, Orajel, and Xylocaine. Topical pain relievers applied to the gums should not be used for teething. Not only does saliva quickly wash the medication away, but the FDA warns against dangerous, potentially life-threatening side effects caused by such products in infants and small children. Note: Because the elderly are particularly sensitive to the effects of many local anesthetics, they should not use more than directed by the package label or the dentist. Anesthetics used for toothache pain should not be used for a prolonged period of time; they are prescribed for temporary pain relief until the toothache can be treated. Denture wearers using anesthetics to relieve pain from a new denture should see their dentist to determine if an adjustment to the appliance is needed to prevent more soreness. Chlorhexidine is an antibiotic drug used to control plaque and gingivitis in the mouth or in periodontal pockets (the space between your gum and tooth). The medication is available as a mouth rinse and as a gelatin-filled chip that is placed in the deep gum pockets next to your teeth after root planing. The drug in the gelatin-filled chip is released slowly over about seven days. Dental products containing this antibacterial are marketed under various prescription-only brand names, such as Peridex, Perio Chip, and Perio Gard, as well as other over-the-counter trade names. Note: Chlorhexidine may increase the staining of tartar and plaque on your teeth. It may also cause staining of the tooth, tooth filling, and dentures or other mouth appliances. Brushing with a tartar-control toothpaste and flossing your teeth daily may help reduce this tartar build-up and staining. In addition, you should visit your dentist at least every six months to have your teeth cleaned and your gums examined. Be sure to tell your dentist if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or to skin disinfectants containing chlorhexidine. Antiseptics Your dentist may recommend the use of an over-the-counter antiseptic mouth rinse product to reduce plaque and gingivitis and kill the germs that cause bad breath. The doxycycline periodontal system (marketed as Atridox) contains the antibiotic doxycycline and is used to help treat periodontal disease. Doxycycline works by preventing the growth of bacteria. Doxycycline periodontal system is placed by your dentist into deep gum pockets next to your teeth and dissolves naturally over seven days. The time release of this medication may continue to occur even after it has dissolved. Note: Tell your dentist if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to doxycycline or to other tetracyclines. Use of doxycycline periodontal system is not recommended during the last half of pregnancy or in infants and children up to age 8, because the product may cause permanent discoloration of teeth and slow bone growth. Use of doxycycline periodontal system is not recommended if breastfeeding, because doxycycline passes into breast milk. This class of drugs also may decrease the effectiveness of estrogen-containing birth control pills, increasing the chance of unwanted pregnancy. Fluoride is a drug used to prevent tooth decay. It is available on a nonprescription basis in many toothpastes. It is absorbed by teeth and helps strengthen teeth to resist acid and block the cavity-forming action of bacteria. As a varnish or a mouth rinse, fluoride helps reduce tooth sensitivity. Prescription-strength fluoride is available as a liquid, tablet, and chewable tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once daily. It is prescribed for children and adults whose homes have water that is not fluoridated (has not had fluoride added to water). Note: Before taking fluoride, be sure to tell your dentist if you are allergic to fluoride, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs. Do not take calcium, magnesium, or iron supplements while taking fluoride without checking with your dentist. Tell your dentist if you are on a low-sodium or sodium-free diet. Do not eat or drink dairy products one hour before or one hour after taking fluoride. Fluoride can cause staining of the teeth if too much is ingested while the teeth are developing. Pilocarpine, marketed as Salagan, may be prescribed by your dentist if you have been diagnosed with dry mouth. The drug stimulates saliva production. Tetracyclines (the class of drugs including demeclocycline, doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline) and the drug triclosan (marketed as Irgasan DP300) are also used in dentistry. These medications may be used either in combination with surgery and other therapies, or alone, to reduce or temporarily eliminate bacteria associated with periodontal disease, to suppress the destruction of the tooth's attachment to the bone or to reduce the pain and irritation of canker sores. Dental antibiotics come in a variety of forms including gels, thread-like fibers, microspheres (tiny round particles), and mouth rinses. Muscle Relaxants may be prescribed to reduce your stress to help you stop grinding your teeth and to treat temporomandibular joint disorders. Antifungals are prescribed to treat oral thrush. The goal of treatment is to stop the spread of the Candida fungus. Antifungal medicines are available in tablets, lozenges, or liquids that are usually ""swished"" around in your mouth before being swallowed."
475,"Do you often find yourself blinking, squinting, or rubbing your eyes to gain a clearer view? If you have blurry vision, you might chalk it up to age or needing new glasses. But it can be a sign of other health problems, too. Often, treatment for these conditions will clear up your blurred vision. Remember, though, that sudden changes to your eyesight aren't normal, so if they happen, see your doctor right away. The condition raises your risk for an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy. Over time, high blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in your retina, the part of your eye that senses light. That can lead to swelling in a part of the retina called the macula, new and unwanted blood vessels growing in the eye, and bleeding inside the eye. Along with blurry vision, diabetic eye disease may also cause: â Floatingâ spots in your field of vision Permanent loss of vision Early treatment is the best way to ward off permanent damage. So protect your eyes from diabetes by getting them checked at least once a year. Learn more about the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy. One of the key signs that you're having a stroke is a sudden, painless change in eyesight. You might have blurry or double vision. Call 911 right away if you have either of these changes and other stroke warning signs, such as: Dizziness Face drooping Loss of balance Slurred speech or other problems speaking clearly Weakness or numbness in one arm Learn more about the timeline of a stroke. If you're pregnant, you shouldn't take blurry vision lightly. It could be a sign of preeclampsia, a dangerous condition marked by very high blood pressure and protein in your urine. Preeclampsia occurs in women who have never had high blood pressure before and generally occurs late in pregnancy, generally after 20 weeks. It can have serious, life-threatening effects on you and your baby. Preeclampsia may not cause any symptoms, but blurry vision and other sight changes such as seeing flashing lights or spots could be clues that you have it. Be sure to contact your doctor if you notice these as well as other possible signs: Anxiety, shortness of breath, a racing heart, or confusion Nausea or vomiting that suddenly starts after the first trimester Pain in your belly, shoulder, or low back Sudden weight gain Swelling, especially in your face, around your eyes, or in your hands Throbbing headaches that don't go away Learn more about how to lower your preeclampsia risk. A migraine is more than a horrible headache. There are a host of other symptoms that you might have with the pain, including blurry vision and sensitivity to light. You may feel these signs even before a migraine starts, and they may last until it's over. More dramatic changes to your eyesight during a migraine are called an aura. They can include: Loss of part or all of your vision for a little while Seeing flashes of light Seeing wavy lines or spots To solve these problems, you'll need to work with your doctor to treat your migraines and keep them from starting. Learn more about migraine headaches with aura. You may know this condition from these symptoms: Itchy or sore patches of skin Joint pain and inflammation Thick, red, scaly patches on the skin But psoriasis can affect your eyes, too. It can cause a condition called uveitis, when inflammation leads to swelling that causes blurred vision, pain, redness, and sensitivity to light. Treatments can get rid of uveitis, but the type you need will depend on which part of your eye is affected. Learn more about uveitis. Blurry vision is often one of the earliest symptoms of multiple sclerosis ( MS). The disease causes inflammation along the nerve that connects your eyes to your brain, called the optic nerve. That causes a condition called optic neuritis, which can give you blurry sight, loss of color vision, and pain when you move your eyes. It often happens in just one eye. Besides blurry vision, MS also causes: Trouble with balance Bladder and bowel problems Dizziness Feeling very tired Numbness Stiffness Weakness Optic neuritis doesn't necessarily mean you have MS, so talk to your doctor about what's causing it. The problem often goes away on its own, but your doctor can give you some medications to help you heal faster. Learn more about vision problems linked to MS. Scary, but true: A tumor in any part of your brain can make pressure build inside your skull. That can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision. Other signs of a possible brain tumor are: Drowsiness Headache that won't go away Nausea Personality changes Seizures Vomiting If your doctor thinks you might have a brain tumor, she'll use different tests to check how well your brain and spinal cord work, as well as imaging tests to see inside your head. Learn more about the different types of brain tumors. Blurry vision is not the first sign of this nerve disease. But as it gets worse, it can affect sight. That's because the condition may change how your eyes move. As your sight seems less sharp, you may strain your eyes because they have to work harder to focus. Parkinson's disease affects much more than the eyes. It also causes: Poor balance and coordination Stiffness in your body Tremors that affect the hands, arms, legs, and face Learn more about Parkinson's disease symptoms."
476,"The early symptoms of mononucleosis are like those of the flu, including: Severe fatigue Headache Sore throat, which sometimes can be very severe Chills, followed by a fever Muscle aches After a day or two, someone with mono may also have: Swollen lymph nodes Jaundice (a yellow tinge to the skin and eyes) A measles-like skin rash anywhere on the face or body. Sometimes the rash develops suddenly after you've taken amoxicillin for a severe sore throat. Tiny red spots or bruise-like areas inside the mouth, especially on the roof of the mouth (palate) Soreness in the upper-left abdomen, from an enlarged spleen Call your doctor about mononucleosis if: You develop severe abdominal pain, which may be a sign of a ruptured spleen. Seek emergency medical treatment immediately. You have the symptoms of mono -- especially for longer than 10 days -- or you have a severe sore throat for more than a day or two. You need to see a doctor to rule out other illnesses, such as strep throat. You develop swollen lymph nodes all over your body, which can also be a sign of some other illnesses. You have severe, persistent headache and a stiff neck, which might be signs of meningitis. You develop a rash consisting of many tiny red spots (which doctors call petechiae), which could be a sign of a low platelet count or other serious illness such as meningitis."
477,"In its early stage, colorectal cancer usually doesn't have symptoms. That's why it's so important to keep up with the tests your doctor recommends to see if you have it, when it's easiest to treat. If you do have symptoms, the most likely ones include: Changes in bowel movements, including constipation or diarrhea that don't seem to go away Feeling like you can't empty your bowels completely or urgently need to have a bowel movement Bleeding or cramping in your rectum Dark patches of blood in or on your stool; or long, thin, ""pencil stools"" Discomfort or bloating in your belly Unexplained fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss Pelvic pain, which can happen in the later stages of the disease Lots of things can cause the symptoms listed above. So you'll need to check with your doctor to find out what's going on. Don't just assume it's hemorrhoids. Make an appointment if you have any of the symptoms, or if a doctor tells you that you have anemia. ( When doctors look for the cause of anemia, they should check for bleeding from the digestive tract because of colorectal cancer.) Your doctor will most likely do a rectal exam. You may also get a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy -- exams that involve a long flexible tube put into your rectum so that your doctor can look for any cancers or growths that could become cancer."
478,"Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It's called acquired when you aren't born with it. It often affects the fat that's just under your skin, so it can change the way you look. It also can cause other changes in your body. Some people with HIV get lipodystrophy ( LD- HIV). It may be related to the medicines they take or the disease itself. Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy ( AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy ( APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer- Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. APL typically starts around ages 8-10. Both conditions affect girls 3 times more often than boys. Both cause a person to lose fat from her face, so she may look sick or much older than she is. Localized lipodystrophy can happen to anyone at any age. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble. However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications. And cosmetic surgery might be an option if looks are a concern. Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: An infection, such as measles, pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or hepatitis A disease where your immune system attacks your body (called an autoimmune disease) Repeated injections in or pressure on the same place on your body An injury For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots. That's a good reason to change your injection site often. While all kinds of acquired lipodystrophy cause a loss of body fat, exactly what that means for each person is different. The type your child has will affect: Where it happens How much fat is lost Other effects on her body AGL. She'll lose fat from under the skin all over her body, including her face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of her feet. She could look very muscular, and you'll be able to see veins under her skin. Kids with AGL are very hungry all the time and grow fast. Adults may have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone if their hormone balance is off and they've kept growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris and ovaries, penis and testicles). A woman might have irregular periods or none at all. She could have polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS). She'll probably have extra hair on her upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet. Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in her body or controlling her blood sugar and triglyceride levels. She could have a large liver or spleen. APL. This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with her face and moves to her neck, arms, and chest. Localized. This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps. When you go to the doctor, he'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child's health: What symptoms have you noticed? When did you first see them? Are changes in how she looks only in certain areas, or all over? Has she had panniculitis -- swollen bumps under her skin or a bumpy red rash? Does she have diabetes? What other health problems or recent injuries has she had? Have you had her blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked? Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells. Urine tests check for kidney problems. What type of lipodystrophy is this? Do you know what caused it? Do we need any more tests? How many other people with this condition have you treated? What's the best way for us to treat it? What other symptoms should we watch for? Do we need to see any other doctors? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel ""normal""? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research trial? Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections ( Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, she'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control her blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse. Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, she may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out her face with skin grafts from her thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for her appearance makes sense and when. Because this condition affects how you look, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and being supportive. Set the tone for others. Be positive and open-minded. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying, or offending or embarrassing you and your child. When someone asks about her, be matter-of-fact about her condition. Do what you can to boost her self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. Encourage friendships. But kids will be kids, so prepare her for unkind looks and words. You can help her practice how she'll react with role-play and humor. Consider professional counseling. Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease. Over time, people with AGL can lose most or all of their body fat. With APL, it typically stops after a few years. In general, the more fat you lose, the more serious the condition is. Yet many people with lipodystrophy live active, productive lives. You'll need to work closely with your doctor to prevent complications. For example, people with AGL are likely to have heart and liver problems. Diabetes can be hard to control. They might develop autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo (light-colored spots of skin), rheumatoid arthritis, and a kind of hepatitis. People with APL probably won't have the insulin-related problems that often come with AGL. But it can lead to kidneys that don't work well or at all, and drusen, tiny fat deposits in the back of the eyes that may be connected to age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Women may get extra fat on their hips and thighs. AGL and APL can be linked to autoimmune disorders, too, including rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Researchers are studying lipodystrophy, and they may find more ways to treat it. If you're looking for a community, Lipodystrophy United is a good place to start. It has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families."
479,"A doctor who specializes in skin care, called a dermatologist, can be a big help with your psoriasis. He'll be up to date on all the triggers you should avoid, symptoms, and treatments. When you look for a dermatologist, start by asking your primary care doctor for a recommendation. You can also check with the American Academy of Dermatology, which has lists of specially trained doctors. A nearby medical school is another resource. Ask these questions to help you choose the right doctor for you: Does your office accept my insurance? How quickly can I schedule a visit? Do you have patient references? Are you available after hours? Do you have evening or weekend hours? Do you have a special area of interest in skin care? How many patients with psoriasis have you treated? Do you offer biologic therapies for psoriasis?"
480,"If you have an irregular heartbeat (you might hear it called arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, or AFib), your doctor will probably suggest a treatment called cardioversion to help you get a normal rhythm back. If your heart beats too fast or unevenly, it can be dangerous. It may not be pumping enough blood to meet your body's needs. An irregular heartbeat also can lead to a stroke or a heart attack. It's an option when medications can't control the problem. Your doctor uses a special machine to send electrical energy to the heart muscle. The procedure restores a normal heart rate and rhythm, allowing your heart to pump better. There are two kinds. Your doctor will talk to you about which one is right for you. Each is usually done in a hospital or outpatient center. Chemical cardioversion: If your arrhythmia isn't an emergency, a doctor will usually use medication to get your heart back to normal. This is called chemical or pharmacologic cardioversion. You typically get the medicine through an IV while doctors check your heart. But sometimes, people can take it as a pill. The type of medicine used will vary based on your type of abnormal rhythm and your other medical problems. The following are some examples of medicines that your health care provider might use: Amiodarone ( Cordarone) Dofetilide ( Tikosyn) Flecainide ( Tambocor) Ibutilide ( Corvert) Propafenone ( Rhythmol) Electrical cardioversion : Drugs alone may not correct your heartbeat. Electrical cardioversion gives shocks through paddles to regulate your heartbeat. First, you'll get medicine to make you fall asleep. Then, your doctor will put the paddles on your chest, and sometimes your back. These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal. Most people only need one. Because you're sedated, you probably won't remember being shocked. You can usually go home the same day. Your skin may be irritated where the paddles touched it. Your doctor can point you toward a lotion to ease pain or itching. Defibrillation also uses electric shocks, but it isn't the same as electric cardioversion. In defibrillation, doctors use high-voltage shocks to treat life-threatening arrhythmias or a heart that has stopped. Yes. Blood clots: Either kind of cardioversion could knock loose blood clots created from your abnormal heartbeat. Before the procedure, your doctor may do a type of ultrasound to look for blood clots in your heart. You'll probably get medicine to take for 3-4 weeks before and after the procedure to help prevent blood clots. Stroke : If a clot travels to your brain, it can cause a stroke. It might not work: Cardioversion doesn't always fix a fast or irregular heartbeat. You may need medicine or a pacemaker to control things. It might make things worse: It's unlikely, but there's a small chance that cardioversion could damage your heart or lead to more arrhythmias. Irritated skin: This often happens where the paddles are applied. The doctor can give you a cream to treat it. Once your heart is back in a normal rhythm, your doctor will give you medicine to make sure it stays that way. You'll go back to your doctor in a few weeks for an electrocardiogram (you may hear it called an EKG) to make sure your beat is still regular. Keep up with your doctor visits and follow your treatment plan, which may also include antiarrhythmic drugs to help your heart maintain its normal rhythm. Let him know if you have any questions or notice any changes in your condition. Electrical cardioversion is more than 90% effective, though many have AFib again shortly after having it. Taking an antiarrhythmic drug before the procedure can prevent this. How well it works depends on the size of your left atrium as well as how long you've been in AFib. If you have a large left atrium or you've been in constant AFib for a year or two, it may not work as well. Taking antiarrhythmic drugs can also prevent AFib after a successful electrical cardioversion. Chemical cardioversion: You should know quickly if it works. It usually takes effect within hours, but sometimes it takes days. If it doesn't work for you, the doctor might suggest electrical cardioversion."
481,"ADHD doesn't only affect children. Adults can have this condition, too. ADHD can make it hard for adults to pay attention, control their emotions, and finish tasks. Just like kids, adults with ADHD are often given stimulants or other medications to control symptoms. They may also have therapy sessions to help get organized and stay focused. One ADHD treatment that doesn't require a prescription or a visit to a therapist's office is exercise. Research is finding that getting regular fitness can improve thinking ability, and it may improve the symptoms of adult ADHD. Exercise isn't just good for shedding fat and toning muscles. It can help keep the brain in better shape, too. When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals called neurotransmitters, including dopamine, which help with attention and clear thinking. People with ADHD often have less dopamine than usual in their brain. The stimulant medicines that are often used to treat adult ADHD work by increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain. So it makes sense that a workout can have many of the same effects as stimulant drugs. Fitness can have the following benefits for adults with ADHD: Ease stress and anxiety. Improve impulse control and reduce compulsive behavior. Enhance working memory. Improve executive function. That's the set of skills needed to plan, organize, and remember details. Increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. That's a protein involved in learning and memory. It's in short supply in people with ADHD. Beyond helping with ADHD symptoms, exercise has several other benefits. Getting regular workouts can help you: Stay at a healthy weight. That's important because evidence suggests that people with ADHD are more likely to become obese. Reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in a normal range. Strengthen your bones. Improve your mood and self-esteem. Health experts recommend that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. That works out to about 30 minutes of fitness a day, five days a week. If you're doing more intense aerobic workouts -- such as running or taking indoor cycling classes -- you can get away with about 75 minutes of exercise a week. It doesn't matter what type of exercise you do. For example, you can try running, biking, taking an aerobics class, or weight training. Do whatever kind of workout you love. Try to vary your exercise routine. That way you won't lose interest or focus halfway through your workouts. You can even change exercises mid-routine, for example by doing interval training. Run or cycle for 30 seconds, alternated with 30 seconds to a minute of weight lifting. As long as you're sweating and your heart is pumping, you're likely to see real, positive effects from exercise on your ADHD symptoms. If you're having trouble staying motivated, get a workout buddy. A friend can help keep you on track, making sure that you exercise on most days of the week. Your exercise buddy will hold you accountable, so you can't bail out on your workouts."
482,"Dazzling smiles seem to be within everyone's reach, thanks to the booming teeth-whitening business. From over-the-counter strips to treatments in a dentist's office, you have a lot of options for brightening up stained or darkened teeth. Side effects aren't common when you use at-home products as directed, but they can happen. Before you start a do-it-yourself whitening routine, though, learn how to keep your smile safe. Get a professional cleaning and mouth exam, even if you decide to whiten your teeth at home. You might only need a thorough cleaning to restore your smile's sparkle. Your dentist will also look for cavities and check the health of your gums during the exam. Treating any problems before you whiten is safer for your mouth. Ask your dentist about which over-the-counter system to use and how much lightening you can expect. Teeth do darken with age, and the amount of color change varies from person to person. At-home whiteners have peroxides, typically carbamide peroxide, in amounts ranging from 10% to 20%. Choose a product with a peroxide level somewhere in the middle of that range. If the product doesn't bother your mouth but doesn't provide the lightening effect you want, you can choose a higher level. If you have any questions, your dentist can help you find the whitener that best fits your needs. Don't leave the strips or gels on longer than advised -- you might wind up with sore gums and set yourself up for other problems. After you whiten, avoid soda, sports drinks, or other acidic beverages for a couple of hours to protect your teeth. To be on the safe side, pregnant women or nursing mothers should postpone teeth whitening. Porcelain or composite dental crowns and bondings won't lighten up. So if you change the color of the teeth around them, you might wind up with an uneven smile or need to replace old fillings and crowns. Your teeth may become mildly sensitive after you whiten, but it's usually short term. It might be less of an issue if your teeth and gums are in good shape. If it bothers you, stop the treatment and talk to your dentist. Gel-filled trays, which you wear over your teeth like a mouth guard, can also bother your gums if they don't fit well. It's a good idea to stop using the product if you start having this problem. How much whitening is too much? If you follow a product's directions and get a good result, a once-a-month touch-up session is usually enough. When your teeth reach a shade you like, you'll need to repeat the multiple bleaching sessions twice a year or less."
483,"If you've followed a fad diet, you have plenty of company. But have you been able to stay on these deprivation diets for a long time? And if you did lose weight, did the pounds stay off once you went back to your usual way of eating? Fad diets don't help you keep off the weight in the long term. So what does work? The best diet is not a diet at all, but a way of life that includes food you enjoy, exercise, and healthy habits. Here's some simple, straightforward advice. Just as a car needs the proper gasoline to make it run, a body needs a healthy diet to develop properly. That means the right balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat -- as well as a host of other nutrients. When you go on a fad diet and exclude necessary nutrients, you're putting yourself at risk for becoming ill. Getting too little of any nutrient may not cause an immediate problem. But if it's lacking for a long time, you may find you have health problems. Food servings have grown larger and larger over the years. And fast-food restaurants aren't the only places you'll find supersized meals. Researchers have noted that from 1970 through the 1990s, portion sizes of hamburgers, burritos, tacos, french fries, sodas, ice cream, pie, cookies, and salty snacks increased -- whether the foods were eaten at home or at restaurants. What does a healthy serving size look like? A cup of fruit should be no larger than your fist. An ounce of meat or cheese is about the same as the size of your thumb from base to tip. 3 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry (a normal serving) is about the size of your palm. 1 to 2 ounces of nuts equals your cupped hand. Here are some simple tricks to scale back your portions (and calories): Serve your meals on salad plates instead of large dinner plates. Store snack foods in tiny sandwich bags. When ordering out, share your entrÃ©e with a friend. Ask for a kids' meal or small size at a fast-food restaurant. Never go for a supersized portion. Eat a variety of foods. Make sure your diet includes lean protein; complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and ""good"" fats like omega-3 fats from fish and monounsaturated fats from avocados, nuts, and olives or olive oil. When you go on a fad diet and exclude necessary nutrients, you're putting yourself at risk for becoming ill. Getting too little of any nutrient may not cause an immediate problem. But if it's lacking for a long time, you may find you have health problems Say no to bad fats. Minimize how much saturated fat you get from animal sources, and eliminate trans fats from the fried foods, snacks, and fast-food products you eat. Get Plenty of fruits and vegetables. How many depends on your age, sex, and activity level. A good reference point for adults is 2 to 3 cups of vegetables and 1.5 to 2 servings of fruits a day. Exercise at least 150 minutes each week. This can be divided into smaller blocks of time. For example, you could do a brisk walk for 10 minutes three times a day for 5 days to reach 150 minutes. Clean out the kitchen! Toss out high-calorie, high-fat, sugary foods that will tempt you to overeat -- chips, cookies, crackers, ice cream, candy bars, and the like. Then, fill your fridge and cupboards with lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, good fats, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. Eat smaller meals more frequently. Aim for five to six mini-meals per day. Space your meals every 3 to 4 hours. Try taking low fat cheese and whole-grain crackers to school or work for a snack, or eat a tablespoon of peanut butter with one slice of whole-grain bread. Find foods that are healthy and that keep you full. Fill up on the good stuff. Pile on the salad and super servings of green beans, broccoli, cabbage, kale, or other low-calorie vegetables instead of high-fat foods, breads, pasta, and desserts. If you're still hungry after a meal and you want seconds, go for veggies. Snack on berries. Dark berries (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, and raspberries) are rich in healthy antioxidants. They're also low in calories and fat and high in fiber. Avoid ""empty calories."" Steer clear of sugar-containing sodas and fruit drinks. If you need more information on weight loss and dieting, talk to your health care provider or a registered dietitian. Ask your doctor about your ""ideal"" weight and the number of calories you must eat to lose pounds and maintain an ideal weight. Also, ask friends, family, or co-workers to join you as you work to change your eating habits and pare down your weight. Sticking to a weight loss plan is much easier when you have someone to support you."
484,"Over-the-counter ( OTC) pain relievers include: Acetaminophen ( Tylenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), including ibuprofen ( Motrin, Advil) or naproxen ( Aleve, Naprosyn) Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs reduce fever and relieve pain caused by muscle aches and stiffness, but only NSAIDs can also reduce inflammation (swelling and irritation). Acetaminophen and NSAIDs also work differently. NSAIDs relieve pain by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause pain. Acetaminophen works on the parts of the brain that receive the ""pain messages."" NSAIDs are also available in a prescription strength that can be prescribed by your physician. Using NSAIDs increase the risk of heart attack or stroke and have also been known to cause stomach ulcers and bleeding. They can also cause kidney problems. Topical pain relievers are also available without a doctor's prescription. These products include creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin in order to relieve pain from sore muscles and arthritis. Some examples of topical pain relievers include Aspercreme, Ben- Gay, Icy Hot, and Capzasin- P. Prescription pain relievers include: Corticosteroids Opioids Antidepressants Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) Lidocaine patches Prescription corticosteroids provide relief for inflamed areas of the body by easing swelling, redness, itching and allergic reactions. Corticosteroids can be used to treat allergies, asthma and arthritis. When used to control pain, they are generally given in the form of pills or injections that target a certain joint. Examples include: prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Prescription corticosteroids are strong medicines and may have serious side effects, including: Weight gain Upset stomach Headache Mood changes Trouble sleeping Weakened immune system Thinning of the bones To minimize these potential side effects, corticosteroids are prescribed in the lowest dose possible for as short of a length of time as needed to relieve the pain. Opioids are narcotic pain medications that contain natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic opiates. Opioids are often used for acute pain, such as short-term pain after surgery. Some examples of opioids include: Morphine Fentanyl Oxycodone Codeine Opioids are effective for severe pain and do not cause bleeding in the stomach or other parts of the body, as can some other types of pain relievers. It is rare for people to become addicted to opioids if the drugs are used to treat pain for a short period of time. But if used to treat chronic pain, the risk of addiction is real and potentially dangerous. Side effects of opioids may include: Drowsiness Nausea Constipation Itching Breathing problems Addiction Antidepressants are drugs that can treat pain and/or emotional conditions by adjusting levels of neurotransmitters (natural chemicals) in the brain. These medications can increase the availability of the body's signals for well-being and relaxation, enabling pain control for some people with chronic pain conditions that do not completely respond to usual treatments. Research suggests antidepressants work best for neuropathic or nerve pain. Chronic pain conditions treated by low-dose antidepressants include some types of headaches (like migraines) and menstrual pain. Some antidepressant medications include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) such as citalopram ( Celexa), fluoxetine ( Prozac), paroxetine ( Paxil), and sertraline ( Zoloft) Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, desipramine ( Norpramin), doxepin ( Silenor), imipramine ( Tofranil), and nortriptyline ( Pamelor) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs) such as venlafaxine ( Effexor) and duloxetine ( Cymbalta) These drugs require a steady dose of the medicine buildup in the body over a period of time to work. The doses needed to treat pain are often lower than those needed to treat depression. In general, antidepressants have fewer long-term side effects than frequent, ongoing use of other pain medicines. Generally, SSRIs and SNRIs have fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants. The most common side effects with antidepressants include: Blurry vision Constipation Difficulty urinating Dry mouth Fatigue Nausea Headache Anticonvulsants are drugs typically used to treat seizure disorders. Some of these medications are shown to be effective in treating pain as well. The exact way in which these medicines control pain is unclear but it is thought that they minimize the effects of nerves that cause pain. Some examples include carbamazepine ( Tegretol), gabapentin ( Neurontin), and pregabalin ( Lyrica). In general, anticonvulsants are well tolerated. The most common side effects include: Drowsiness Dizziness Fatigue Nausea Another means of topical pain relief comes in the form of a lidocaine ( Lidoderm) patch, which is a prescription medication. If your pain is not relieved by the usual treatments, your doctor may refer you to a pain management specialist. Doctors who specialize in pain management may try other treatments such as certain types of physical therapy or other kinds of medicine. They may also recommend TENS, a procedure that uses patches placed on the skin to send signals that may help stop pain. Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) is a method of pain control that allows the patient to control the amount of pain medication administered. This is often used in the hospital to treat pain. By pushing a button on a computerized pump, the patient receives a pre-measured dose of pain medicine. The pump is connected to a small tube that allows medicine to be injected intravenously (into a vein), subcutaneously (just under the skin), or into the spinal area."
485,"In the 1960s and '70s, new info about how the immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- plays a role in psoriasis led to several new treatments. Drugs like corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate became mainstays for managing the disease. For the next few decades, though, advances in treatment slowed down. Thanks to recent progress in research, that's ancient history. New biologic therapies work well to treat psoriasis, and other new treatments are close to FDA approval. Research in psoriasis doesn't always make headlines -- or win funding -- like discoveries in cancer or heart disease. And studies are hamstrung by the one-of-a-kind nature of your skin. Unlike many other diseases, experiments on mice or other animals aren't very helpful. In recent years, research into other autoimmune diseases brought new insights about the immune system. It turns out that some of the problems in those conditions are active in psoriasis, as well. The new info brought treatments that target specific areas of your immune system. Called biologics, these drugs launched a new era of psoriasis treatment. They're medicines made from substances found in living things. Doctors inject these lab-made proteins or antibodies into your skin or bloodstream. Once inside the body, the drug blocks part of your altered immune system that adds to psoriasis. In general, biologics work on psoriasis because they: Curb T cells (a form of white blood cell) Block a substance called tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha), one of the main messenger chemicals in the immune system Stop a family of your immune system's chemical messengers called interleukins Bind to proteins that cause inflammation The patches and plaques of psoriasis come after an interaction between your skin cells and white blood cells. Biologics interfere with TNF-alpha or T cells, or they target interleukins. This short-circuits that unhealthy link. This will ease your inflammation. You'll have less growth of thick, scaly skin, too. Biologic medicines approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe psoriasis include: Adalimumab ( Humira), a TNF-alpha-blocking antibody Adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), a biosimilar to Humira Brodalumab ( Siliq), a human antibody against interleukins Certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia), a TNF-alpha blocker Etanercept ( Enbrel), a TNF-alpha blocker Etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi), a biosimilar like Enbrel Guselkumab ( Tremfya), an antibody against interleukins Infliximab ( Remicade), a TNF-alpha blocker Ixekizumab ( Taltz), an antibody that binds to inflammation-causing proteins/interleukins Risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), an antibody against interleukins Secukinumab ( Cosentyx), a human antibody against interleukins Ustekinumab ( Stelara), a human antibody against interleukins Biologics are good at treating psoriasis. In clinical trials, each of the drugs lowered psoriasis activity by at least 75% in many people. There are some drawbacks, though. Biologics can be expensive. Though they're safe for most people, they could raise your chances of infection, cancer, and other complications. Your doctor will need to keep close tabs on you to make sure you stay healthy. Apremilast is a drug you take by mouth that's approved to treat psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis in adults. It curbs phosphodiesterase-4 ( PDE-4), an enzyme that controls inflammation. Side effects include diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Some people in studies who took the drug lost weight. If you use the medicine, it's recommended that you check your weight regularly and watch out for signs of depression."
486,"Quitting smoking can be a real challenge. But it's one of the best things you can do for your health. Smoking is a dangerous, even deadly habit. It's a leading cause of cancer. It also increases your risk for heart attacks, strokes, lung disease, and other health problems, including bone fractures and cataracts. If nicotine lozenges, patches, chewing gum, counseling, and other smoking cessation methods haven't helped you kick the habit, don't give up. Ask your doctor if hypnosis is an option for you. Some studies have shown that hypnosis may help certain people quit smoking. Hypnosis is defined as an altered state of awareness in which you appear to be asleep or in a trance. Clinical hypnosis may be used to treat certain physical or psychological problems. For instance, it is frequently used to help patients control pain. It is also used in a wide range of other conditions such as weight issues, speech disorders, and addiction problems. There is debate about how hypnosis works. Some people believe that when you are hypnotized, you relax and concentrate more, and are more willing to listen to suggestions -- such as giving up smoking, for example. Even though you appear to be in a trance during hypnosis, you are not unconscious. You are still aware of your surroundings, and -- despite what many stage performers may claim during an entertaining show -- you cannot be made to do anything against your will. In fact, brain tests performed on patients during hypnotism sessions have shown a high level of neurological activity. During hypnosis for smoking cessation, a patient is often asked to imagine unpleasant outcomes from smoking. For example, the hypnotherapist might suggest that cigarette smoke smells like truck exhaust, or that smoking will leave the patient's mouth feeling extremely parched. Spiegel's method is one popular smoking cessation hypnosis technique that focuses on three main ideas: Smoking poisons the body You need your body to live You should respect your body and protect it (to the extent you'd like to live) The hypnotherapist teaches the smoker self-hypnosis, and then asks him or her to repeat these affirmations anytime the desire to smoke occurs. Hypnosis, in general, does not work for everyone. About one in four people are not able to be hypnotized. When successful, the intensity of hypnosis can vary from person to person. How well hypnosis works to help people stop smoking depends on who you ask. Study results have been mixed. In 2010, a systematic review of published studies found that there wasn't enough evidence to support the use of hypnosis. Another review published in 2012 said that studies do support a possible benefit from the use of hypnosis. In discussing alternative methods for quitting smoking on its web site, the American Cancer Society says that while controlled studies have not supported the effectiveness of hypnosis, there is anecdotal evidence that some people have been helped. Despite some web sites and promotional materials that say otherwise, hypnosis is not an approved therapy by the American Medical Association ( AMA). The organization does not have an official position on the use of hypnosis. A position statement regarding the use of the technique for medical and psychological purposes was rescinded by the AMA in 1987. Researchers who have studied hypnosis say more, well-conducted studies are needed to determine if hypnosis really helps smokers kick the habit for good, but add that hypnosis remains a hopeful approach and has many other benefits. However, the best way to quit may be to combine several techniques. Patients often require several different strategies along the way. If you want to try hypnosis to help you quit smoking, ask your health care provider to recommend a good hypnotherapist. Here are some tips when looking for a qualified hypnotherapist: Make sure they are licensed, trained, and credentialed. Hypnosis for smoking cessation and other medical or behavioral reasons should only be done by someone who has a current license in a health care field, such as medicine, psychiatry, psychology, or nursing. Ask some tough questions. Ask about their professional training. The American Society for Clinical Hypnosis also suggests asking: â Is this practitioner able to help me without using hypnosis?"" If the answer is no, you should look elsewhere. Beware of too-good-to-be true claims or guarantees. Hypnosis does not work for everyone. Remember, it's never too late to quit smoking. Doing so has immediate health benefits. And, if you quit smoking before you turn 50, you'll cut the risk of dying in the next 15 years in half, compared to those who keep lighting up."
487,"Cancer treatments can be hard on your body. Fatigue, weakness, hair loss, nausea, and pain are all byproducts of living with this disease. The toll cancer takes on your emotions is no less serious, but it may not be as easy to spot. Most people have to learn to manage feelings like fear, anxiety, and depression at some point during their journey. That's where mind-body medicine comes in. This is a form of what doctors call complementary medicine. That means it isn't the traditional type of medicine you get in a pill or shot. These are practices you do in addition to your regular treatments to help you relax and focus your mind so you can get more control over your emotions and improve your physical health. Life with cancer can be stressful. When your body is under stress, it releases cortisol. This hormone sends blood and nutrients rushing to your brain and muscles so they can react to the threat at hand. Your muscles tense, your breathing quickens, and your heart beats faster. That takes resources away from other important body systems -- including your immune system. Long-term stress can strengthen the effects of your cancer and treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. Mind-body medicine helps you relax and buffer some of these effects. It can also help you manage your condition better. Meditation: This simple practice has been around for thousands of years. It's easy -- just sit quietly and breathe deeply. Sometimes you repeat a word or phrase called a mantra. The idea is to gain control over your thoughts and breathing to help you relax. Even though it's simple, meditation can do a lot of good for people with cancer. Mindfulness meditation, in which you focus only on the present moment and your breathing, can help ease stress, improve your coping skills, and enhance your well-being. Deep breathing: This part of meditation also works on its own. Just take a deep breath in from your diaphragm, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly let it out. A few minutes each day can help you feel more relaxed. In one study, deep breathing improved quality of life in people with breast cancer who were treated with chemotherapy. Progressive muscle relaxation: This technique relaxes your entire body, one muscle group at a time. It can help people with cancer manage side effects like: Anxiety and stress Depression Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Pain Trouble sleeping It's also easy to do: Lie down somewhere quiet. Tense then relax each group of muscles. Start with your feet and work your way up your body. Flex and relax your toes, feet, ankles, lower legs, upper legs, belly, chest, fingers, arms, shoulders, neck, and face. By the time you reach your head, you should feel calmer and more at ease. Guided imagery and visualization: Use them to harness the power of your imagination. Focus on a pleasant scene to steer your mind away from stressful thoughts related to your cancer or your treatments. You can create your own image, use a CD or video to guide you, or work with a therapist. One 20-minute guided imagery session a day can help: Ease stress and anxiety Slow your heart rate and breathing Lower your blood pressure Boost your immune system to help your body heal more quickly Relieve symptoms of your cancer Manage side effects of treatment How to do it: Sit or lie down in a quiet room and close your eyes. Breathe in and out deeply. Picture an image that's calming and pleasant, like a lake with mountains in the distance. Use all your senses. Feel the gentle breeze on your face. Smell the flower-scented air. Hear the wind ripple the water. Imagine your stress is a small boat moving away from the shore, and away from you. Yoga and tai chi: These exercise programs blend deep breathing and relaxation. Yoga combines a series of strengthening, stretching, and balance poses with deep breathing. It can help people with cancer: Ease anxiety, depression, and stress Lessen fatigue Get better sleep Improve their quality of life and emotional well-being Tai chi is an ancient Chinese martial art. Because it's made up of a series of gentle movements combined with deep breathing, it's sometimes called ""meditation in motion."" People with cancer who take up tai chi might notice: Lower anxiety and stress Less pain Harder-working immune system Higher quality of life Know that while they can be a helpful add-on to your cancer treatment, they aren't meant to replace standard options like chemotherapy and radiation. Some hospitals and cancer centers offer mind-body medicine programs. Enroll in a class to learn how to practice them correctly. If your hospital doesn't offer one of these programs, ask your doctor for advice on how to get started. You don't even need to take part in a formal mind-body medicine program to see the benefits. Simply walking outside in nature or listening to music can help you feel better."
488,"Many medications can cause adverse side effects and certain drugs can trigger allergic reactions. In the case of allergic reactions, when a drug first enters the body, the immune system mistakenly responds by creating specific disease-fighting antibodies, called immunoglobulin E, or Ig E antibodies. These antibodies recognize the drug as a foreign substance. When the drug is taken again, these antibodies spring into action, releasing large amounts of histamine in an attempt to expel the drug from the body. Histamine is a powerful chemical that can affect the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, or cardiovascular system. Symptoms of a drug allergy can range from mild to life-threatening. Even in people who aren't allergic, many drugs can cause irritation, such as an upset stomach. But during an allergic reaction, the release of histamine can cause signs like hives, skin rash, itchy skin or eyes, and congestion. A more severe reaction may include swelling in the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, blueness of the skin, dizziness, fainting, anxiety, confusion, rapid pulse, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal problems. The most common drug associated with allergies is penicillin. Other antibiotics similar to penicillin can also trigger allergic reactions. Other drugs commonly found to cause reactions include sulfa drugs, barbiturates, anticonvulsants, tetracycline, aspirin, and iodine (found in many X-ray contrast dyes). A doctor diagnoses a drug allergy by carefully reviewing your medical history and symptoms. If your doctor suspects that you are allergic to an antibiotic such as penicillin, he or she may do a lab or skin test to confirm it. However, skin testing does not work for all drugs, and in some cases it can be dangerous. In rare cases, it may be necessary to test for a drug allergy by actually giving small doses of the suspected medicine. But this may trigger a life threatening anaphylactic reaction, so it should only be done under certain circumstances at special allergy centers. If you have had a severe, life-threatening reaction to a particular drug, your doctor may simply rule out that drug as a treatment option for you. Conducting an allergy test to determine if the initial reaction was a ""true"" allergic response may not be worth the risk. The primary goal when treating drug allergies is symptom relief. Symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching can often be controlled with antihistamines and occasionally corticosteroids. For coughing and lung congestion, drugs called bronchodilators may be prescribed to widen the airways. For more serious anaphylactic symptoms -- life-threatening reactions including difficulty breathing or loss of consciousness -- epinephrine may be needed. Call 911 for any of these symptoms. Occasionally, desensitization is used for penicillin allergy. This technique decreases your body's sensitivity to particular allergy-causing agents. Tiny amounts of penicillin are injected periodically in increasingly larger amounts until your immune system learns to tolerate the drug. If you are severely allergic to certain antibiotics, there are usually alternative antibiotics your doctor can prescribe when needed. If you have a drug allergy, you should always inform your health care provider before undergoing any type of treatment, including dental care. It is also a good idea to wear a Medic Alert bracelet or pendant, or carry a card that identifies your drug allergy. In cases of emergency, it could save your life."
489,"A vestibular migraine is a nervous system problem that causes repeated dizziness (or vertigo) in people who have a history of migraine symptoms. Unlike traditional migraines, you may not always have a headache. There are many names for this type of problem. Your doctor might also call it: Migraine-associated vertigo Migrainous vertigo Migraine-related vestibulopathy Vestibular migraines don't always cause headaches. The main symptom is dizziness that comes and goes. Vestibular refers to the inner ear, which controls your hearing and balance. If you're having a vestibular migraine, you may feel: Dizziness that lasts more than a few minutes Nausea and vomiting Balance problems Extreme motion sensitivity -- feeling sick or dizzy when you move your head, eyes, or body Feeling disoriented or confused Feeling unsteady, like you're in a rocking boat Sensitivity to sound You could get dizzy and have balance problems without having a migraine at all. Other times, the vertigo symptoms happen before, during, or after the headache. Sometimes, you might have migraines for years before the vertigo symptoms begin. Doctors aren't sure. Like migraines, there are a lot of theories. But how it really happens is poorly understood. They credit it to misfires between nerve cells in your brain. It's hard to tell how many people are living with this condition. The symptoms mimic a lot of other diseases. Researchers think they affect about 1% of the population. But that number could be higher. Like traditional migraines, they're more common in women than men. Vertigo symptoms tend to first strike around age 40. But the condition doesn't just affect adults. Kids can get it, too. There's no blood or imaging test that can tell for sure. But the International Headache Society and other organizations recently set up the first criteria to help your doctor diagnose the disorder. You could be having a vestibular migraine if: You have migraines or had them in the past. You have at least 5 episodes of vertigo that make you feel like you are spinning or moving. This isn't the same as motion sickness or feeling faint. These feelings last between 5 minutes to 72 hours. Your symptoms are moderate to severe. That means they stop you from doing everyday tasks or they're so bad you can't do anything at all. At least half of the episodes happen with one of the following migraine symptoms: A headache that has two of these characteristics: is one-sided, pulsing, moderate to severe, or gets worse with activity Sensitivity to light or sound Seeing shimmering or flashing lights in your vision (a migraine aura) He'll likely order an MRI to check your brain and run hearing and balance tests to look for problems with your ears. Meniere's disease. Before you get dizzy, usually one of your ears feels full or stuffy, or hurts. During an attack, one or both ears may ring, or you might lose hearing. This doesn't usually happen with a vestibular migraine. Brainstem stroke. Along with vertigo, you'll also have numbness, weakness, trouble speaking, and other stroke symptoms. If you have any of these symptoms, or if you have new vertigo that has not been diagnosed, get immediate emergency help. There's no specific medication for vestibular migraines. Your doctor will prescribe different drugs to stop an attack when it happens. This is called abortive therapy. Triptans. Take these migraine meds at the first sign of headache symptoms. Vestibular suppressant. It can ease your dizziness and motion sensitivity. This type of drug works on the balance center in your inner ear. Your doctor might prescribe benzodiazepines like lorazepam ( Ativan), anti-nausea drugs like promethazine ( Phenergan), and antihistamines like meclizine. If you have frequent or disabling vestibular migraines, your doctor may try drugs similar to traditional migraine prevention meds. You take these regularly to reduce the severity or frequency of the headaches. These include seizure medicines, blood pressure medicines (like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers), and some antidepressants. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of preventive medicine that your doctor may recommend if other medicines don't help. If you have frequent or disabling vestibular migraines, your doctor may try drugs similar to traditional migraine meds. They include: Antiseizure drugs like gabapentin and topiramate Blood pressure medicines like beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers Tricyclic antidepressants SSRIs or SNRIs There is the possibility of getting relief through use of some devices. Cefaly, a small headband device that sends electrical pulses through the forehead to stimulate a nerve linked with migraines Spring TMS or e Neura s TMS, a device which can be held at the back of your head at the first sign of a headache, and it gives off a magnetic pulse that stimulates part of the brain. gamma Core is a hand-held portable device which is a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (n VS). When placed over the vagus nerve in the neck, it releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain. Knowing your headache triggers may help you ward off migraine-related vertigo. Things like chocolate, cheese, alcohol, and foods with the preservative MSG are triggers for some people. If you have vestibular migraines, these things might trigger your symptoms, too. It can't hurt to cut them from your diet to see if your symptoms ease up a bit. Tracking your diet is another good way to help tell if your vertigo symptoms are really due to headaches. For example, a high-salt diet can make vertigo symptoms worse if you have Meniere's disease. Keep a food diary and show it to your doctor. It can help improve your diagnosis and treatment."

Scientists have developed new drugs, and they have a better understanding of how to use older treatments. That has made a big difference in everyday life for people with the disease. Most people can get relief from their Parkinson's symptoms with medicines. But some may need surgery if their medications stop working well enough. The medicines you take early on have a strong impact on how your condition will unfold over time. So it's important to work with a neurologist or other Parkinson's specialist who can guide you through those treatment decisions. Levodopa and carbidopa ( Sinemet). Levodopa (also called L-dopa) is the most commonly prescribed medicine for Parkinson's. It's also the best at controlling the symptoms of the condition, particularly slow movements and stiff, rigid body parts. Levodopa works when your brain cells change it into dopamine. That's a chemical the brain uses to send signals that help you move your body. People with Parkinson's don't have enough dopamine in their brains to control their movements. Sinemet is a mix of levodopa and another drug called carbidopa. Carbidopa makes the levodopa work better, so you can take less of it. That prevents many common side effects of levodopa, such as nausea, vomiting, and irregular heart rhythms. Sinemet has the fewest short-term side effects, compared with other Parkinson's medications. But it does raise your odds for some long-term problems, such as involuntary movements. A new, inhalable powder form of levopoda ( INBRIJA) has been approved for those experiencing OFF periods, OFF periods are when Parkinson's symptoms return during periods between scheduled doses of levodopa/carbidopa. People who take levodopa for 3-5 years may eventually have restlessness, confusion, or unusual movements within a few hours of taking the medicine. Changes in the amount or timing of your dose will usually prevent these side effects. Safinamide ( Xadago) is an add-on medicine that may be prescribed when individuals taking levdopoa and carbidopa have a breakthrough of Parkinson's symptoms that were previously under control. Studies show that adding this drug helps individuals experience longer times with reduced or no symptoms. The most common side effects are trouble falling or staying asleep, nausea, falls, and uncontrolled, involuntary movements. Dopamine agonists. These drugs act like dopamine in the brain. They include ropinirole ( Requip), pramipexole ( Mirapex), and rotigotine ( Neupro). You can take one of these drugs on its own or along with Sinemet. Most doctors prescribe dopamine agonists first and then add levodopa if your symptoms still aren't under control. Dopamine agonists don't have the same risks of long-term problems as levodopa therapy. So they are often the first choice of treatment for Parkinson's disease. However, these drugs do raise the chances of some short-term side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, light-headedness, confusion, and hallucinations. Amantadine ( Symmetrel) may help people with mild Parkinson's disease. It works by raising the amount of dopamine that your brain cells can use, which helps you have fewer Parkinson's symptoms. Recent studies have found that Symmetrel may help ease the involuntary movements that can happen with levodopa therapy. But it may cause side effects, such as confusion and memory problems. Trihexyphenidyl ( Artane ) and benztropine ( Cogentin). These drugs restore the balance between two brain chemicals, dopamine and acetylcholine. That eases tremors and muscle stiffness in people with Parkinson's. But these medications can harm memory and thinking, especially in older people. Because of that, doctors rarely prescribe them today. Selegiline ( Eldepryl Zelapar) and rasagiline ( Azilect). These drugs block the brain chemicals that break down dopamine. That helps your brain have more dopamine to work with. Some evidence shows that selegiline may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, especially early on. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness or fainting, and stomach pain. Studies of animals suggest that rasagiline may also slow the progression of Parkinson's. Side effects include headache, joint pain, indigestion, and depression. Tolcapone and entacapone. When you take levodopa, a chemical in your body called COMT makes part of the drug useless. The drugs tolcapone ( Tasmar) and entacapone ( Comtan) block COMT, so the brain can use levodopa more effectively, which eases Parkinson's symptoms. There is no one best mix of Parkinson's medicines. You and your doctor will have to try a few treatment approaches to figure out the best one for you. But there are some general guidelines for taking your medication. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist for any specific tips for your treatment. Don't split pills or pull capsules apart unless your doctor tells you to. Drink six to 10 glasses of water a day. Warm baths or physical activity may help your body digest and absorb your medication. Know the names of your medications and how you take them. Know the generic and brand names, your doses, and the side effects you might have. Always keep a list of those details with you. Take your medications exactly as your doctor prescribes them. Don't stop taking or change your medicines unless you talk to your doctor first. Even if you feel good, you still need to take them. Your condition can get worse if you suddenly stop your medicine. Have a routine for taking your medications. Take them at the same time each day. Set an alarm to remind you if you need to. Keep a medication calendar and note every time you take a dose. If you miss a dose at your scheduled time, don't panic. Take it as soon as you remember. But if it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and return to your regular medication schedule. Don't keep outdated drugs. Get rid of them by following the instructions on the drug label or patient information sheet. Or check with your pharmacist about how to dispose of them. Store drugs in a dry area away from moisture (unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you the medicine needs to be refrigerated). Don't share your medications with others. Take extra medicine with you when you travel in case you need to stay away longer than planned. And keep it in your carry-on luggage, not in a checked bag. Refill your prescriptions before you are completely out of medicine. Call the pharmacy at least 48 hours before you run out. If you have trouble getting to the pharmacy, have financial concerns, or have other problems that make it hard for you to get your medications, let your doctor know. A social worker may be able to help you. Read all labels carefully. Tell all your health care providers about all the medicines you take. Know all the medicines and foods you're allergic to. Review any side effects your medicines can cause. Most reactions will happen when you start taking something, but that's not always the case. Some reactions may be delayed or may happen when you add a drug to your treatment. Call your doctor right away about anything unusual. Use one pharmacy if possible. Try to fill all your prescriptions at the same location, so the pharmacist can watch for drugs that might interact with each other. You can use online tools to see if any of your medicines won't work well together. You have the right and responsibility to know what medications your doctor prescribes. The more you know about them and how they work, the easier it will be for you to control your symptoms. You and your doctor can work together to create and change a medication plan. Make sure that you understand and share the same treatment goals. Talk about what you should expect from medications so that you can know if your treatment plan is working."
491,"Kaposi's sarcoma ( KS) is a type of cancer. Tumors with tiny new blood vessels grow below the surface of the skin and in membranes of your mouth, nose, eyes, and anus. It can spread to your lungs, liver, stomach, intestines, and lymph nodes, which are glands that help you fight infection. Researchers have found that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus, HHV-8, also called KSHV. It affects 8 times more men than women. It may spread through sexual contact, but we don't know for sure. KS was once rare, affecting older men from Eastern European or Mediterranean families, young African men, or people who had undergone organ transplants. Now HIV is the most common cause. Because people with HIV have weakened immune systems, they're more likely to develop certain cancers, including KS. Most severe cases happen when someone has AIDS, the late stage of HIV infection, but skin lesions can also show up earlier. They're a sign your immune system isn't at full strength. Skin lesions tend to get worse when you also have other infections. Treating the HIV virus with antiretroviral therapy ( ART) is the best way to treat KS, too, especially early on. Anti- HIV drugs have dropped the rate of KS cases by 80%-90% from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. The most visible signs of Kaposi's sarcoma are lesions on the skin: flat, painless spots that are red or purple on white skin and bluish, brownish, or black on dark skin. Unlike bruises, they don't turn white when you press on them. They aren't itchy, and they don't drain. They're not life-threatening. New spots may show up each week. For some people, these lesions change slowly. They may grow into raised bumps or grow together. When KS spreads elsewhere, it can be life-threatening. You may have: Trouble eating or swallowing Queasiness, vomiting, and belly pain from bleeding and blockages inside Severe swelling in your arms, legs, face, or scrotum Serious coughing or shortness of breath Your doctor may diagnose Kaposi's sarcoma simply by looking at your skin. To confirm it, he may take a sample of tissue from a spot and look at it under a microscope, which is called a biopsy. If you have trouble breathing, your doctor may use a thin tube with a light (a bronchoscope) to look into your breathing passages. Or, if you have tummy troubles, he may want to look inside your guts through a lighted tube during a procedure called an endoscopy. Your treatment will depend on how many lesions you have and how big they are and where they are, as well as how well your immune system is working. In many cases, ART is the best way to treat active Kaposi's sarcoma. It may even clear up the skin lesions. If you have just a few, you could have them removed. That won't cure you, but it can make your skin look better. Your doctor can cut the tissue out or freeze it to destroy it. Radiation can kill the cancer cells or keep them from growing. A machine can direct it toward the lesions on your body, or your doctor may put radioactive needles, seeds, or wires inside you near the cancer. Once KS has spread, you'll need meds that go throughout your whole body to kill the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs for Kaposi's sarcoma include: Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin, Doxil) Paclitaxel ( Taxol) Vinblastine ( Velban) Chemotherapy can have side effects, including hair loss, vomiting, and fatigue. If you're HIV-positive, you also need to consider that chemo can lower your platelet and white-blood-cell counts, and raise your chances of an infection. Another type of drug treatment, called biological therapy, works by boosting your immune system. Your doctor may prescribe interferon alfa ( Intron A) if your CD4 cell count is over 200 and you have a fairly healthy immune system. Targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibody therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs), are being tested in clinical trials. These try to attack the cancer and keep it from growing without harming healthy cells."
492,"Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP) is a term for a group of eye diseases that can lead to loss of sight. What they have in common is a coloring your doctor sees when he looks at your retina -- a bundle of tissue at the back of your eye. When you have RP, cells in the retina called photoreceptors don't work the way they're supposed to, and over time, you lose your sight. It's a rare disorder that's passed from parent to child. Only 1 out of every 4,000 people get it. About half of all people with RP have a family member who also has it. The retina has two types of cells that gather light: rods and cones. The rods are around the outer ring of the retina and are active in dim light. Most forms of retinitis pigmentosa affect the rods first. Your night vision and your ability to see to the side -- peripheral vision -- go away. Cones are mostly in the center of your retina. They help you see color and fine detail. When RP affects them, you slowly lose your central vision and your ability to see color. Retinitis pigmentosa usually starts in childhood. But exactly when it starts and how quickly it gets worse varies from person to person. Most people with RP lose much of their sight by early adulthood. Then by age 40, they are often legally blind. Because rods are usually affected first, the first symptom you may notice is that it takes longer to adjust to darkness (called ânight blindness). For example, you may notice it when you walk from bright sunshine into a dimly lit theater. You may trip over objects in the dark or not be able to drive at night. You may lose your peripheral vision at the same time or soon after your night vision declines. You may get ""tunnel vision,"" which means you can't see things to the side without turning your head. In later stages, your cones may be affected. That will make it harder for you to do detail work, and you may have trouble seeing colors. It's rare, but sometimes the cones die first. You might find bright lights uncomfortable -- a symptom your doctor may call photophobia. You also may start to see flashes of light that shimmer or blink. This is called photopsia. More than 60 different genes can cause the different types of retinitis pigmentosa. Parents can pass the problem genes on to their children in three different ways: Autosomal recessive RP: Each parent has one problem copy and one normal copy of the gene that's responsible, but they don't have any symptoms. A child that inherits two problem copies of the gene (one from each parent) will develop this type of retinitis pigmentosa. Since two copies of the problem gene are needed, each child in the family has a 25% chance of being affected. Autosomal dominant RP: This type of retinitis pigmentosa requires only one copy of the problem gene to develop. A parent with that gene has a 50% chance of passing it to each child. X-linked RP: A mother who carries the problem gene can pass it down to her children. Each one of them has a 50% chance of getting it. Most women who carry the gene won't have any symptoms. But about 1 out of every 5 will have mild symptoms. Most men who get it will have more severe cases. Fathers who have the gene can't pass it to their children. An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) can tell you if you have retinitis pigmentosa. He'll look into your eyes and do some special tests: Ophthalmoscope: The doctor will put drops into your eyes to make your pupil wider to get a better look at your retina. He will use a handheld tool to look into the back of your eye. If you have RP, there will be specific kinds of dark spots on your retina. Visual field test: You'll look through a tabletop machine at a point in the center of your vision. While staring at that point, objects or lights will appear to the side. You'll press a button when you see them, and the machine will create a map of how far to the side you can see. Electroretinogram: The eye doctor will put a film of gold foil or a special contact lens on your eye. Then he will measure how your retina responds to flashes of light. Genetic test: You'll submit a DNA sample to find out which form of RP you have. If you or anyone in your family is diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, all family members should go to the eye doctor for screening. There's no cure for retinitis pigmentosa, but doctors are working hard to find new treatments. A few options can slow your vision loss and may even restore some sight: Acetazolamide: In the later stages, the tiny area at the center of your retina can swell. This is called macular edema, and it, too, can reduce your vision. This medication can ease swelling and improve your vision. Vitamin A palmitate: High doses of this compound may slow retinitis pigmentosa a little each year. But you have to be careful, because too much can be toxic. Work closely with your doctor and follow her recommendations. Sunglasses: These make your eyes less sensitive to light and protect your eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays that may speed vision loss. Retinal implant: If you have late-stage RP, you may be a candidate a retinal implant that could provide partial sight. Argus II is the implant available in the US. It's implanted into a single eye and paired with glasses equipped with a camera. Images are converted to electrical pulses that are sent to the retina. Many were able to locate lights and windows. Some were able to determine where other people were located in a room and about half of the subjects were able to read letter that were about 9 inches high. Other treatments under review include: Replacement of damaged cells or tissues with healthy ones Gene therapy to put healthy genes into the retina Devices and tools can help you make the most of your vision, and rehab services can help you stay independent."
493,"Two initial tests are commonly used to look for prostate cancer in the absence of any symptoms. One is the digital rectal exam, in which a doctor feels the prostate through the rectum to find hard or lumpy areas known as nodules. The other is a blood test used to detect a substance made by the prostate called ""prostate-specific antigen"" ( PSA). When used together, these tests can detect abnormalities that might suggest prostate cancer. Neither of these initial tests for prostate cancer is perfect. Many men with a mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and men with prostate cancer may have normal levels of PSA. Also, the digital rectal exam does not detect all prostate cancers, as it can only assess the back portion of the prostate gland. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by examining prostate cells under a microscope. This is done by performing a biopsy in a urologist's office. A small sample of tissue is taken from the prostate for testing and evaluation under a microscope. Your doctor is likely to discuss your medical history with you. Answering questions about any history of genital or urinary disease in your family can help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor may also ask about any changes in your pattern of urinating."
494,"Vertigo is a sensation of feeling off balance. If you have these dizzy spells, you might feel like you are spinning or that the world around you is spinning. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Vertigo is often caused by an inner ear problem. Some of the most common causes include: BPPV. These initials stand for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. BPPV occurs when tiny calcium particles (canaliths) clump up in canals of the inner ear. The inner ear sends signals to the brain about head and body movements relative to gravity. It helps you keep your balance. BPPV can occur for no known reason and may be associated with age. Meniere's disease. This is an inner ear disorder thought to be caused by a buildup of fluid and changing pressure in the ear. It can cause episodes of vertigo along with ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss. Vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis. This is an inner ear problem usually related to infection (usually viral). The infection causes inflammation in the inner ear around nerves that are important for helping the body sense balance Less often vertigo may be associated with: Head or neck injury Brain problems such as stroke or tumor Certain medications that cause ear damage Migraine headaches Vertigo is often triggered by a change in the position of your head. People with vertigo typically describe it as feeling like they are: Spinning Tilting Swaying Unbalanced Pulled to one direction Other symptoms that may accompany vertigo include: Feeling nauseated Vomiting Abnormal or jerking eye movements (nystagmus) Headache Sweating Ringing in the ears or hearing loss Symptoms can last a few minutes to a few hours or more and may come and go. Treatment for vertigo depends on what's causing it. In many cases, vertigo goes away without any treatment. This is because your brain is able to adapt, at least in part, to the inner ear changes, relying on other mechanisms to maintain balance. For some, treatment is needed and may include: Vestibular rehabilitation. This is a type of physical therapy aimed at helping strengthen the vestibular system. The function of the vestibular system is to send signals to the brain about head and body movements relative to gravity. Vestibular rehab may be recommended if you have recurrent bouts of vertigo. It helps train your other senses to compensate for vertigo. Canalith repositioning maneuvers. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend a series of specific head and body movements for BPPV. The movements are done to move the calcium deposits out of the canal into an inner ear chamber so they can be absorbed by the body. You will likely have vertigo symptoms during the procedure as the canaliths move. A doctor or physical therapist can guide you through the movements. The movements are safe and often effective. Medicine. In some cases, medication may be given to relieve symptoms such as nausea or motion sickness associated with vertigo. If vertigo is caused by an infection or inflammation, antibiotics or steroids may reduce swelling and cure infection. For Meniere's disease, diuretics (water pills) may be prescribed to reduce pressure from fluid buildup. Surgery. In a few cases, surgery may be needed for vertigo. If vertigo is caused by a more serious underlying problem, such as a tumor or injury to the brain or neck, treatment for those problems may help to alleviate the vertigo."

It is a group of symptoms that may result from having part of your stomach removed or from other surgery involving the stomach. The symptoms range from mild to severe and often subside with time. Although you may find dumping syndrome alarming at first, it is not life threatening. You can control it by making changes in what and how you eat. By controlling dumping syndrome, you will also be avoiding the foods that tend to make you gain weight. After gastric surgery, it can be more difficult to regulate movement of food, which dumps too quickly into the small intestine. Eating certain foods makes dumping syndrome more likely. For example, refined sugars rapidly absorb water from the body, causing symptoms. Symptoms may also happen after eating dairy products and certain fats or fried foods. An early dumping phase may happen about 30 to 60 minutes after you eat. Symptoms can last about an hour and may include: A feeling of fullness, even after eating just a small amount Abdominal cramping or pain Nausea or vomiting Severe diarrhea Sweating, flushing, or light-headedness Rapid heartbeat Symptoms of an early phase happen because food is rapidly ""dumping"" into the small intestine. This may be due to factors such as these: The small intestine stretches. Water pulled out of the bloodstream moves into the small intestine. Hormones released from the small intestine into the bloodstream affect blood pressure. A late dumping phase may happen about 1 to 3 hours after eating. Symptoms may include: Fatigue or weakness Flushing or sweating Shakiness, dizziness, fainting, or passing out Loss of concentration or mental confusion Feelings of hunger Rapid heartbeat The symptoms of this late phase may happen due to a rapid rise and fall in blood sugar levels. The cause of this rapid swing in blood sugar may be worse when eating sweets or other simple carbohydrates. If you have not already been diagnosed with the dumping syndrome, and you have confusion, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or fainting, get immediate medical help. Call 911 right away. Many people find that taking steps like these greatly reduces symptoms of dumping syndrome. Foods to avoid. Avoid eating sugar and other sweets such as: Candy Sweet drinks Cakes Cookies Pastries Sweetened breads Also avoid dairy products and alcohol. And avoid eating solids and drinking liquids during the same meal. In fact, don't drink 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after meals. Foods to eat. To help with symptoms, also try these tips: Use fiber supplements, such as psyllium ( Metamucil or Konsyl), methylcellulose ( Citrucel), or guar gum ( Benefiber). Use sugar replacements, such as Splenda, Equal, or Sweet' N Low, instead of sugar. Go for complex carbohydrates, such as vegetables and whole-wheat bread, instead of simple carbohydrates, such as sweet rolls and ice cream. To prevent dehydration, drink more than 4 cups of water or other sugar-free, decaffeinated, noncarbonated beverages throughout the day. How to eat. Here are some other ways to lessen symptoms of dumping syndrome: Eat five or six small meals or snacks a day. Keep portions small, such as 1 ounce of meat or 1/4 cup of vegetables. Cut food into very small pieces. Chew well before swallowing. Combine proteins or fats along with fruits or starches. ( For example, combine fruit with cottage cheese.) Stop eating when you first begin to feel full. Drink liquids 30 to 45 minutes after meals. Reclining after eating may help prevent light-headedness. It is important to manage dumping syndrome so you stay well-nourished and don't lose too much weight. Talk to your health care provider about any symptoms you have and what else you can do. In some cases, medication or surgery may be needed to help correct the symptoms of dumping syndrome."
496,"What will treating DVT, a blood clot deep in a vein, do for you? It will prevent the clot from growing. You'll avoid long-lasting complications, such as leg pain and swelling. Treatment prevents future blood clots, too. Often, medication and taking care of yourself will do the trick. But you may need surgery. Talk to your doctor about which medical treatment options are right for you. These drugs, also called anticoagulants, are the most common treatment for DVT. They can keep a clot from growing or breaking off, and they prevent new clots from forming. But they can't thin your blood, despite their name, or dissolve an existing clot. Blood thinners include: Apixaban ( Eliquis) Betrixaban ( BEVYXXA) Dabigatran ( Pradaxa) Edoxaban ( Savaysa) Fondaparinux ( Arixtra) Heparin Rivaroxaban ( Xarelto) Warfarin ( Coumadin) In the hospital, your doctor may give you heparin at first, by a needle into your vein or as a shot. You may have to keep taking shots at home, once or twice daily. When you take heparin by IV, you'll need blood tests, too. But you won't need them when you're taking shots of low-molecular-weight heparin under your skin. You may take warfarin( Coumadin) by pill once a day, starting while you're still on heparin, and then usually for 3 to 6 months or more. While you take it, you'll need regular blood tests to make sure you've got the right amount in your system -- too little won't prevent clots, too much makes dangerous bleeding more likely. It can also interact with other medicines, vitamins, and foods with a lot of vitamin K, which is another good reason to get your blood checked often. Let your doctor know if you're pregnant, because warfarin can cause birth defects. You'll have to take something else. Newer anti-clotting medicines, known as Xa inhibitors, work as well as warfarin for most people. You won't have to get blood tests, change your dose, or remember what foods you ate. These drugs may cause less bleeding than warfarin, but there's no medicine you can take to stop bleeding if it becomes a problem. Apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are all pills. Fondaparinux is a shot that people who are having hip fracture, hip replacement, knee replacement, or abdominal surgery get to prevent DVT. Your doctor might also prescribe it with warfarin to treat a serious DVT or to treat a clot that gets stuck in your lung, called a pulmonary embolism. Dabigatran is a pill that stops a specific protein that helps your blood clot from working. That's why it's called a direct thrombin inhibitor. Your body will dissolve the blood clot eventually, but in the meantime, it could damage the inside of your vein. Your doctor may recommend a clot-busting medicine called a thrombolytic agent if you: Have large clots causing pain, swelling, and problems with circulation Are at high risk for a pulmonary embolism Have DVT in your arm, rather than your leg This procedure quickly breaks up a clot and restores blood flow. It may also save the valves in that vein. But it's riskier than taking blood thinners. You have a greater chance of bleeding problems and stroke. You'll go to the hospital to get it done. Using an X-ray as a guide, a specialist will put a thin tube called a catheter into your vein and work the tip of it into your DVT. Then he'll use the catheter to send the drug directly into the clot. If your vein seems narrow, he may widen it and help prevent future blockages by doing a balloon angioplasty or placing a stent. When taking blood thinners or clot-busting isn't possible or doesn't work well, your doctor may want to try a more involved procedure. Vena cava filter. This small metal device catches blood clots and stops them from moving to parts of your body where they can become dangerous. Blood passes through the filter normally. It goes in the vena cava, the main vein that takes blood from your lower body back to your heart. The doctor will put the filter into a leg, neck, or arm vein and move it into the vein in your belly. Venous thrombectomy. In very rare cases, you may need to have a deep vein clot cut out. A severe type of DVT, called phlegmasia cerulea dolens, doesn't respond well to other kinds of treatment."
497,"Smart eating habits can make your life a little easier when you have irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, or IBS- D. And you don't have to completely give up any foods you like. "" Moderation is important,"" says Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, author of the American Dietetic Association ( ADA) Guide to Better Digestion. It's important to stick to a balanced diet when you have IBS. So never totally avoid certain groups of food, or you may be depriving yourself of nutrients you need. Experiment with what you eat to find out what works for you Bonci says. "" People could be selective with what they have, saying, ' OK, I'm no good with apples, but I'm alright with a pear. Or grapes don't work for me, but I'm OK with having a little bit of a banana.'"" Keep a symptom journal to track which foods and which amounts seem to give you diarrhea. It's the best way to figure out which eats might be causing you problems. Remember, different foods affect people differently. You could also try an elimination diet -- if you think certain foods might be triggering your symptoms, stop eating them one at a time, and see how that makes you feel. Don't avoid fiber if you have diarrhea. It helps protect your body against heart disease, by lowering your LDL cholesterol, and certain cancers, so you need it. Simply eat more soluble fiber, rather than the insoluble kind, Bonci says. Soluble fiber stays in the gut longer, which helps the colon work normally. You find soluble fiber in foods such as: Oats Peas Beans Apples Citrus fruits Carrots Barley Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, is found in things like: Whole-wheat flour Wheat bran Nuts Beans Cauliflower Green beans Potatoes Although meeting your daily fiber needs is best accomplished by eating the right foods, taking a fiber supplement can also help. Examples of supplements include psyllium, methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly to help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake. As long as your doctor has not restricted your fluids, shoot for six to eight 8-ounce glasses of plain H2 O each day, but not always with meals. "" Water just makes everything run through a little more rapidly,"" Bonci says. She suggests you drink it an hour before or an hour after meals. Only you know which ones give you IBS- D symptoms. But while you figure out your own triggers, you might want to take special care with foods known to cause symptoms in some people with your condition: Broccoli, onions, and cabbage Fried or fatty foods like French fries Milk or dairy products such as cheese or ice cream Alcohol Caffeine in coffee, teas, and some sodas Carbonated sodas Chocolate Gluten, found in wheat, rye, and barley Sorbitol, a sugar substitute found in gum and mints, and fructose, a simple sugar in honey and some fruits, also trigger IBS symptoms in some people. How you eat may also give you trouble. You might be bothered by foods with extreme temperatures, especially if you have them together, like ice-cold water with steaming hot soup. Many people get symptoms after large meals. Try to eat less at each meal, or have four or five small meals a day. Remember, your reactions to what you eat are unique, Bonci says. So experiment with different foods until you've come up with your own IBS nutrition prescription. "" There isn't an IBS diet, per se,"" Bonci says. â Some people will find they're OK with particular foods, and other people find there's just no way."""
498,"It's a question that puzzles lots of folks when those familiar symptoms hit: Is all that coughing and sneezing from a cold or hay fever? var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } It's sometimes a tough call, but how long your problems last is one of the big clues. They have different causes. You get a cold when a tiny living thing called a virus gets into your body. There are hundreds of different types that can get you sick. Once a cold virus gets inside you, your immune system, the body's defense against germs, launches a counter-attack. It's this response that brings on the classic symptoms like a cough or stuffed up nose. The viruses that cause colds are contagious. You can pick them up when someone who's infected sneezes, coughs, or shakes hands with you. After a couple of weeks, at the most, your immune system fights off the illness and you should stop having symptoms. It's a different story with allergies. They're caused by an overactive immune system. For some reason, your body mistakes harmless things, such as dust or pollen, for germs and mounts an attack on them. When that happens, your body releases chemicals such as histamine, just as it does when fighting a cold. This can cause a swelling in the passageways of your nose, and you'll start sneezing and coughing. Unlike colds, allergies aren't contagious, though some people may inherit a tendency to get them. Take stock of your symptoms and how long they last to help you decide what's causing your trouble. Characteristic Cold Allergy How Long It Lasts 3-14 days Days to months -- as long as you're in contact with the allergy trigger and a short time after When It Happens Most often in the winter, but possible at any time Any time of the year -- although the appearance of some allergy triggers is seasonal When It Starts Symptoms take a few days to appear after infection with the virus Symptoms can begin immediately after contact with allergy triggers Symptom Cold Allergy Cough Often Sometimes Aches Sometimes Never Fatigue Sometimes Sometimes Fever Rarely Never Itchy, watery eyes Rarely Often Sore throat Often Sometimes Runny or stuffy nose Often Often The most important difference is that colds usually don't last longer than 14 days. So see your doctor if you still have symptoms after 2 weeks. These may be allergy symptoms or signs of another problem."
499,"The number of older people with HIV is growing. In part, that's because improved treatments are helping people with the disease live longer. But thousands of older people are also newly diagnosed with HIV every year. And there could be even more seniors who are living with the disease without realizing it. The idea that HIV has a bad reputation and feelings of shame or fear may keep older people from learning about the disease, getting tested, and seeking treatment. Older people face challenges that can add to the usual risks for infection. They're often less aware of how HIV spreads, and they're less likely to have protected sex. It's not something divorced and widowed seniors are used to thinking about when they start dating again. And older women know they're not going to pregnant, so it may not seem important to use a condom. Changes to the vagina in older women also can increase their risk of getting HIV during sex. Even though they visit their doctors more often, seniors are typically less likely than young patients to talk about their sexual habits or drug use. And doctors are less likely to ask about them. HIV affects each person differently, so there's no single telltale sign. The symptoms of HIV can be mistaken for the regular process of aging. Some people may not see any symptoms at first, while others may feel like they have the flu a few weeks after they're infected, with: Cough Diarrhea Fever Headache Sweats It can take as long as 10 years for other symptoms to show up, such as: Weight loss Swollen glands Little energy Loss of appetite Skin rashes, sores in your mouth or genital area, or repeated yeast infections Gut cramps Short-term memory loss If you think you could have HIV, talk to your doctor. An early diagnosis means you can start treatment and prevent the disease from becoming AIDS. You could get tested at your doctor's office or a clinic, hospital, or community health center, and it's often free. HIV is a manageable disease. But because older people are often diagnosed later, the disease may have had time to do more damage to the immune system. After you've tested positive, even if you don't feel any different, it's important to find an HIV doctor right away. Because of your age, your treatment plan may involve several health care providers to treat a range of physical and mental needs. HIV raises your odds of age-related health problems, including heart disease, thin bones, dementia and certain cancers. To stay healthy, you'll need to take care of yourself. Exercise regularly, keep a healthy weight, eat well, and quit smoking. Tell your doctor about new and changing symptoms. Also let all your doctors know about the drugs you're taking, because some medications can make your HIV drugs less effective. It isn't a normal part of aging, but older people in general are at greater risk for depression. Seniors may have fewer friends and family members left in their lives, and it can be hard for them to talk about their feelings to anyone. So they feel more alone. But it isn't just being lonely, sad, or hopeless. Depression in older people can also look like memory problems, general complaints about pain, and seeing or hearing things. And people who have HIV are more likely to be depressed. A diagnosis of HIV could make it even harder to talk to people you care about, if you're worried about what they might think or say about you. You may be less likely to get medical care or ask for help, even when services are available. Don't ignore depression. It's a real illness, and it can get in the way of you staying healthy. Depression may be linked to lower immune system response and higher levels of inflammation, which can make living with HIV harder. And when you're depressed, you may not care as much about sticking to your treatment. Let your doctor know if you've been struggling for more than a couple of weeks. Treating depression can help you feel better mentally and physically."
500,"Medication for ADHD is a lot like a pair of eyeglasses. Just as your glasses sharpen fuzzy vision, meds help your brain focus. They work as long as they're active in the body. Some are good for a few hours, while others can last most of the day. Stimulants are the medications that most people use for ADHD symptoms. They don't cure it, but they boost levels of chemicals in your brain that help you focus and pay attention. There are two types of stimulants: short-acting and long-acting. They use the same medicine -- either amphetamines or methylphenidates. What's different is how they release the drugs into your body. If your doctor thinks a stimulant is right for you, it's helpful to know the differences between these two kinds. These start working in about 30 to 45 minutes and generally wear off in 3 to 6 hours. They include: Amphetamines: Mixed amphetamine salts ( Adderall, Evekeo) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine, Pro Centra) Methylphenidates: Dexmethylphenidate SR ( Focalin) Methylphenidate immediate release ( Ritalin, Methylin) This kind of medicine helps if you need to focus for just a few hours. Perhaps you're working on spreadsheets or writing a report and need to be sharp. A short-acting med peaks and falls in your bloodstream quickly. You might feel irritable when it wears off. That's called a rebound effect. If you want to control symptoms all day, you'll need to pop more than one pill. That can be inconvenient and hard to remember to do when you're busy. Long-acting drugs are designed to work in phases. Part of them release into your bloodstream shortly after you take them (typically in the morning) and the rest throughout the day. These meds are a good choice if you need symptom relief all day but want to take just one pill. Some people say they feel âsmootherâ than short-acting drugs because they cause fewer ups and downs. But some people find they need to supplement their long-acting medicine with a short-acting one later in the day, when the effects may wear off. Your choices include: Amphetamines: Extended-release mixed amphetamine salts ( Adderall XR): last 8-12 hours Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine Spansule): 6-8 hours Lisdexamfetamine ( Vyvanse): 10-12 hours Methylphenidates: Dexmethylphenidate extended release ( Focalin XR): 6-10 Methylphenidate extended release: ( Concerta): 8-12 hours( Metadate ER): 6-8 hours( Metadate CD): 8-10 hours( Methylin ER): 6-8 hours( Ritalin LA): 8-10 hours How long the medication lasts depends on how quickly your body processes it. If it's not long enough for you, you can ask your doctor about adding a short-acting âboosterâ med in the late afternoon or evening. It may take some time to find the right medication and the right dose. Call your doctor if yours isn't working for you or if side effects like trouble sleeping or headaches are bothering you."
501,"Thrombocytopenia means you don't have enough platelets, cells in your blood that stick together to help it clot. It might not cause you any health problems at all. But if you do have symptoms like bleeding too much, treatments can help. Platelets are made in your bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside your bones. You can get thrombocytopenia if your body doesn't make enough of them, or if they're destroyed faster than they can be made. Your body might not make enough platelets if you have a: Blood disorder that affects bone marrow, called aplastic anemia Cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma, which damages your bone marrow Platelet-lowering disease that runs in your family, like Wiskott- Aldrich or May- Hegglin syndrome Virus such as chickenpox, mumps, rubella, HIV, or Epstein- Barr Aplastic anemia Chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer destroys stem cells that form platelets. If you've been in contact with chemicals like pesticides and arsenic, your body might slow down the process of making platelets. Your body can destroy too many platelets by: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP), where your own body attacks healthy cells Medicines, such as antibiotics that contain sulfa, heparin used to prevent blood clots, and antiseizure drugs such as phenytoin ( Dilantin) and vancomycin ( Vancocin) Rare diseases that make blood clots form in the body, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC) Viruses like Epstein- Barr virus ( EBV), hepatitis C, and HIV Sometimes, you don't have enough platelets because they get trapped in your spleen, an organ that fights infection. And women may get thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, because their bodies get rid of platelets more quickly than usual. Sometimes you don't have any symptoms from thrombocytopenia. When you do, the main one is bleeding in the skin that look like tiny red or purple spots on the skin, called petechiae, or bruising. You can bleed outside or inside your body. Sometimes it can be heavy or hard to stop. Some people get nosebleeds or bleeding gums. You might also have: Blood in your urine or bowel movement Heavy menstrual periods These symptoms might not start until your platelet count is very low. If you notice any of them, call your doctor. Your doctor will ask questions about your medical history and symptoms. You'll also get an exam to look for bruises, petechiae or spots of blood in your skin, and other signs of low platelets. You'll be checked for signs of infection, like a fever or rash. You might get a blood test that measures the number of platelets. A normal count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. You can have bleeding problems if your count drops below 50,000. Your doctor will most likely consult with a blood specialist (hematologist). You might get other tests, including: Blood smear to look at your platelets under a microscope and see how healthy they are Bone marrow test to see what cells are in the bone marrow, how full the bone marrow is with cells, and whether they are normall Your doctor might want you to take other tests that check if your blood clots normally. If your platelet count isn't too low, you might not need treatment. You won't bleed too much, even if you get cut. Sometimes your platelet count will go up when you avoid the cause of the problem. For instance, if taking a certain medicine is behind your thrombocytopenia, your doctor will have you stop that drug. For severe thrombocytopenia, you might get: Steroid medicines to stop your body from destroying platelets if the cause is related to your immune system. Blood or platelets from a healthy person, called a transfusion Surgery to remove your spleen If your condition is ongoing despite other treatments, your doctor may prescribe medicines such as romiplostim ( Nplate) and eltrombopag ( Promacta, Revolade). A new medicine called fostamatrinib ( Tavalisse) may be another option. To prevent bleeding when your platelets are low: Avoid medicines that can affect your platelet function, like aspirin and ibuprofen Limit how much alcohol you drink, because it can make bleeding worse. Don't play contact sports, like football or boxing, where you might get injured. Use a soft toothbrush to prevent bleeding gums. Wear a seatbelt in the car, and put on gloves and goggles when you work with power tools to prevent injury."
502,"Millions of Americans have allergies. Most of those millions have symptoms involving their eyes. A common eye allergy affects the clear layer of skin that covers the front of your eyes and the inside of your lids (called the conjunctiva). Your doctor may refer to it as allergic conjunctivitis. There are several different causes for this. But for the most part, if you're allergic to a particular substance and then come into contact with it, you have an allergic reaction like itching and sneezing. That layer of skin covering the front of your eyes? It's the same type of skin that lines the inside of your nose. Because these two areas are so similar, the same things can trigger allergic reactions in both places. Common triggers include: Pollen Grass Weeds Dust Pet dander If you have seasonal allergies, you generally have symptoms for a short time. You may be bothered in the spring by tree pollen, in the summer by grass pollen, or in the fall by weed pollen. The symptoms tend to clear up during other times of the year, especially in the winter. If you have ""perennial allergies,"" your symptoms probably last all year. You're likely allergic to indoor things, like dust mites, cockroaches, and pet dander. Seasonal outdoor allergens may make things worse if you're sensitive to them, too. Seasonal and perennial allergies have identical symptoms and, almost always, itching lets you know you're having an allergic reaction. Along with itchy eyes, you may have: Redness Tearing Burning sensation Blurred vision Inflammation Runny nose Your symptoms should improve on their own if you know what you're allergic to and you can avoid it. But if you don't know what causes your allergy, skin testing by an allergist can help figure it out. If you still don't know or you can't avoid the cause, a doctor who specializes in eye care and surgery -- an ophthalmologist or optometrist -- may be able to help. If you have seasonal allergies, make an appointment with him prior to your allergic season. This will let you start treatment before your symptoms kick in. If you have perennial allergies, routine appointments may be helpful. Occasional flare-ups may mean you need to see him more often. It might also help to get a consultation with an allergist. Is there a specific cause of my eye allergy? How can I ease my symptoms? Your eye doctor may be able to diagnose your eye allergy based on the symptoms you've told him about. He'll check your eyes to rule out other problems. He'll examine the inner lining of the eye lids using a microscope called a slit lamp. He'll be looking for dilated blood vessels and swelling. In very rare cases, he may scrape that layer of skin that covers the front of your eyes to check for something called eosinophils. They're cells that are commonly linked to allergies but are only found in the most severe cases. Get off to a good start by avoiding whatever you're allergic to. You can also try these tips: Minimize clutter where allergens can collect. Limit pillows, bedding, draperies, and other linens, such as dust ruffles and canopies. Also, keep knick-knacks to a minimum, since they can collect dust. Go with as little carpeting as possible. The carpet can harbor dust mites. Clean regularly and thoroughly. That'll help limit dust and mold. Get rid of any water leaks and standing water. Both encourage mold growth. Use barriers and filters. Shield mattresses and pillows with covers that block allergens. Use allergen filters in both the furnace and the air conditioner in your home. Also, be sure to change them regularly. Keep outdoor allergens outdoors by keeping windows and doors closed. Unfortunately, it's not always easy or possible to avoid the things that trigger your allergies. If that's the case for you, these at-home treatments may give you some relief: Apply cool compresses to your eyes to ease the allergic reaction. Use artificial tears or lubricating eye drops. Use over-the-counter medications , like allergy eye drops and oral antihistamines for mild allergies. Try not to rub your eyes, since that can make your symptoms worse. Lots of over-the-counter meds, like allergy or antihistamine eye drops as well as antihistamines you take by mouth, can help against mild allergies. Follow the directions on the packages exactly. Prescription eye drops usually work well, and most don't have side effects. Many of them are taken twice a day, and can be used to prevent an allergic reaction. Some common ones include: Azelastine ( Optivar) Epinastine ( Elestat) Ketotifen ( Zaditor) Nedocromil ( Alocril) Olopatadine ( Patanol) Pemirolast ( Alamast) Steriods are generally used to obtain initial relief, particularly bad allergic response. Your doctor might prescribe corticosteroids if your allergies are severe. They come with a risk of side effects. Some common corticosteroids used for eye allergies are: Fluorometholone ( FML, FML Forte, FML Liquifilm) Loteprednol 0.02% ( Alrex) Loteprednol 0.05% ( Lotemax) Medrysone ( HMS) Prednisolone ( AK- Pred) Rimexolone ( Vexol) For mild cases of seasonal or perennial allergies, annual follow-up visits with your eye doctor are a good idea. You may need to go more often for a severe case."
503,"Just above your collarbone, at the bottom of your neck, is your thyroid. It's a butterfly-shaped gland that controls things like how fast your heart beats and how quickly you burn off calories. It releases hormones to help regulate your body's metabolism (all the things your body does to turn food into energy and keep you going). var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; NIH.gov.<br> Nucleus Medical Media. SUBJECT: Your thyroid gland is found just below your voice box or larynx. It wraps around your windpipe or your trachea. Your thyroid affects your metabolism. It makes hormones that affect how fast your whole body works and how it uses energy. Your body uses thyroid hormone to increase your energy and raise your body temperature when needed. For example, that helps replace the heat your body loses when exposed to cold weather. if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } If you have hyperthyroidism, it means your thyroid is overactive and produces too much of a hormone called thyroxine. It can significantly speed up your metabolism and cause unpleasant symptoms. Some common signs include: Feeling nervous, anxious, or irritable Experiencing mood swings Feeling very tired or weak Sensitivity to heat An enlarged thyroid (goiter). This can make the base of your neck look swollen. Losing weight suddenly with no known cause Fast or irregular heartbeat or palpitations (pounding in your heart) Increased frequency in your bowel movements Shaking in your hands and fingers (tremor) Sleep problems Thinning skin Changes in your hair that make it fine and brittle Changes in your menstrual cycle These are less likely to show up if you're an older adult, but sometimes there will be subtle symptoms. These can include a faster heart rate or you could be more sensitive to hot temperatures. Or you could just feel more tired than usual from everyday activities. Certain medicines can cover up the signs of hyperthyroidism. If you take beta blockers to treat high blood pressure or another condition, you might not know you have it. Be sure your doctor knows about all the medications you take. When you first get hyperthyroidism, you may feel very energetic. This is because your metabolism is sped up. But over time, this increase in your metabolism can break your body down, and cause you to feel tired. Usually, hyperthyroidism develops slowly over time, but if you're young when you get it, the symptoms might come on suddenly. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is an immune system disorder called Graves' disease. It's more likely to affect women under the age of 40. In addition to the other symptoms of hyperthyroidism, about 30% of people with Graves' disease develop a condition called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It affects your eyes and vision, including the muscles and tissues around them. You may experience: Bulging of your eyes (exophthalmos) A gritty feeling or pain/pressure in your eyes Redness or inflammation in or around your eyes Puffiness or retraction of your eyelids Sensitivity to light Double vision or loss of vision Sometimes people with Graves' disease also develop a symptom called Graves' dermopathy, but this is rarer. It involves redness and thickening of your skin, usually on the tops of your feet or your shins."
504,"Back pain is, well, a pain. For the 80% of adults who experience it at some point in their lives, the go-to treatment is often over-the-counter pain relievers, an ice pack, and rest. But while most back pain does go away on its own, there are times when toughing it out at home isn't a good idea. If your pain falls into any of the categories below, make an appointment with your doctor: Injury or accident: Sports injuries, car accidents, or falls that trigger back pain need immediate medical attention. Even if the incident seems minor, it could have caused a bigger problem like a fracture or herniated disk. Let your doctor exam you to rule out any potential after-effects. Severe, chronic pain: If your back pain lasts more than 3 months, it's what doctors call chronic. Make an appointment so your doctor can check for injuries or illnesses that could be to blame. Radiating pain: Low back strains and sprains, sciatica, and a herniated disk can cause back pain to âradiateâ -- move to other parts of your body. If it's causing aching, numbness or tingling in your butt, genitals, legs, feet, arms or hands, see your doctor. He'll be able to find out why and give you something to ease your symptoms. Limited range of motion: Do you have trouble bending over to tie your shoes or reaching overhead? Back pain plus limited range of motion could be a sign of a chronic condition like osteoarthritis. Fever: When you have a high temperature and back pain, take it seriously. It could be the sign of a spinal infection, which needs urgent medical attention. Loss of bladder or bowel control: If you have back pain and suddenly can't control your bladder or bowels, call your doctor right away. This could be a sign of several things, like spinal tumors or cauda equina syndrome, a rare but serious condition caused by a severe compression of the nerve roots in the spine. It could also signal lumbar spinal stenosis, which causes compression of the nerves in the lower back. Unexplained weight loss: If your back hurts and you're losing weight â 10 pounds or more â but don't know why, see your doctor right away. That could be a sign of a more serious medical problem."
505,"A burp or belch can help ease an upset stomach. But if it happens often, it can be a sign of a health problem. If you burp a lot, it's probably time to find out why. When you swallow your food, it goes through a tube called your esophagus and into your stomach. There your body uses acid, bacteria, and chemicals called enzymes to break it down into nutrients it uses for energy. If you swallow air along with your food or if you drink something like a soda or beer that has bubbles in it, those gases can come back up through your esophagus. That's a burp. Carbonated beverages and swallowing air are the most common reasons people burp. Most of the time, that gas doesn't make it to your stomach. Instead it stays trapped in your esophagus until it comes back up. You're more likely to swallow air and burp if you: Chew gum Smoke Eat too quickly Suck on hard candies Have dentures that don't fit right Foods with a lot of fat or oil in them can cause heartburn. This also can make you burp. So can drinks with caffeine or alcohol. Burping as many as four times after a meal is normal. But some illnesses can make you burp a lot more than that: Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD), sometimes called acid reflux, happens when acid in your stomach flows back into your esophagus and causes heartburn. If you have this only occasionally, you can treat it with over-the-counter medicines. But if you have it a lot, you may need to make changes in your diet or take prescription drugs. Indigestion, also called dyspepsia, causes pain or discomfort in your upper belly. It can come with belching, bloating, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting. Gastritis happens when the lining of your stomach is irritated. Helicobacter pylori is a kind of bacteria that can cause an infection in your stomach and lead to ulcers. Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS) can also cause belly cramps, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. If you're concerned about how much you burp, talk with your doctor. She might have some suggestions to help keep it from happening. She also may run tests to look for signs of a health problem. If no medical issue is causing you to burp, you might try some of these: Eat or drink more slowly. You're less likely to swallow air. Don't eat things like broccoli, cabbage, beans, or dairy products. They can lead to gas in your stomach or intestines and make you burp. Stay away from soda and beer. Don't chew gum. Stop smoking. Your doctor will give you lots of reasons to do this, but it also can help cut down on how much you burp. Take a walk after eating. A bit of exercise can help your digestion. Take an antacid."
506,"If you have diabetes, there's a higher chance that you could have many other health problems, like heart disease and high blood pressure. A protein in your blood called haptoglobin helps protect you from some of the heart-related complications of diabetes. But whether it works like it should depends on your DNA, or genes. Several studies have looked at why some people with diabetes have heart and artery problems and others don't. It appears that the kind of haptoglobin you have has a lot to do with it. Your liver makes haptoglobin, and it's found in your plasma, the watery part of the blood. It's an antioxidant. That means it protects your body from damage caused by certain chemical reactions. Your body makes more when you have an injury, infection, or inflammation. Hemoglobin is what carries iron in red blood cells. When these cells reach the end of their natural lifespan, they break down, and what's left goes into your bloodstream. That loose hemoglobin can damage your blood vessels. Haptoglobin's job is to soak up loose hemoglobin molecules before they make trouble. A certain gene controls haptoglobin, and it has two versions. You get one gene from each parent. So your pair of haptoglobin genes could be both version 1, both version 2, or one of each. Your particular combination is called your genotype. Problems come when you have diabetes and 2-2 (version 2 from both your parents). 2-2 haptoglobin doesn't get rid of hemoglobin molecules as well as the other types do. Among other problems, that seems to keep âgoodâ cholesterol from doing what it should to lower your overall cholesterol level. Research shows that people with the 2-2 genotype are more likely than people with either the 1-1 or 2-1 genotype to have heart problems if they have diabetes. That's true for people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Other studies have found the 2-2 genotype also may give people with type 1 diabetes a greater chance of kidney failure. And kidney disease can affect your heart health. A DNA test is the only way to find out what kind of haptoglobin you have. Ask your doctor whether you should get tested. If you know you're more likely to have problems with your heart and your blood vessels, you can manage the other things that cause them, like your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Here's how to keep those under control: Don't smoke. Get to a healthy weight. Exercise most days. Eat less saturated fat, cholesterol, and salt. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, ask your doctor about medicines to lower your blood pressure and bring your cholesterol and blood sugar into healthy ranges. Vitamin E might also help. It's a powerful antioxidant, and some research shows it may help with the problems that 2-2 haptoglobin can cause in people with diabetes. But don't take vitamin E unless your doctor says to. If you don't have the 2-2 genotype, antioxidant supplements may do more harm than good."
507,"Skin comes in all colors, from the palest ivory to the darkest brown and nearly every shade in between. Skin problems, however, are generally color-blind, meaning that most skin conditions can occur in every race and in all skin types. That said, there are certain skin conditions that seem to affect dark skin more frequently or with more severity. Further, many treatments used for common skin conditions can sometimes lead to even more problems when used on people of color. But before you can learn how to protect your face and body, it's important to know a little something about the biology of dark skin. The color of all skin stems from cells called melanocytes. They produce melanosomes, packets containing the natural chemical melanin. Studies show that all people have roughly the same number of melanocytes in skin tissue, regardless of color. What differs is both the size and distribution of the melanosomes. The more and larger they are, the darker skin will be. Since the role of melanin in the skin is to absorb and scatter energy from ultraviolet ( UV) light, having a dark complexion reduces the risk of sun damage, particularly as it pertains to skin aging and skin cancer formation. At the same time, dark skin is more likely to develop pigmentation problems. Even minor skin injuries, such as bug bites, can cause an change in skin pigment, allowing dark spots called hyperpigmentation to occur. When not properly administered, any cosmetic treatment that injures the skin -- such as laser surgery, dermabrasion (removal of dead skin cells), wrinkle-filling injections like Restylane, or Botox injections -- has the potential to cause pigmentation problems. In hyperpigmentation, the skin either produces too much pigment or the pigment is deposited deep within the skin, resulting in dark spots. When color is lost, it's called hypopigmentation, which results in light-colored patches. All people with dark skin are at risk for both skin conditions. Among the most common types of pigment problems in dark skin is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This occurs as a result of skin injury, such as a cut, scrape, or burn. It can also occur in conjunction with eczema or acne. The darkened area of skin can take from months to years to fade, though medical treatments can help. Treatments include removing layers of skin via a chemical peel and prescription bleaching treatments. These treatments won't work on pigment deeper in the skin. Daily use of sunscreen will also help keep a pigmented area from becoming darker. Those with sensitive skin are at greatest risk for pigmentation problems. In fact, any skin care product ingredient that irritates or dries skin increases the risk. The most common products include benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid (used to treat acne) and anti-aging compounds such as retinoids and glycolic acid. In some patients, the skin-bleaching compound hydroquinone can also irritate skin. In those with lighter skin, product-related irritation normally subsides once use is discontinued. But in people of color, the irritations often give way to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This can develop within one to two weeks after stopping the product and can linger for several months or longer. It's important to note that all these ingredients can be successfully used on dark complexions as long as they are used correctly. Also known as dermatitis, this skin condition is characterized by an itchy, red rash that comes on gradually and lasts a long time. It can be triggered by such things as stress, extreme changes in temperature, dry skin, pet or plant allergies, or irritations caused by skin care or cosmetic ingredients. When eczema occurs as the result of an inherited tendency, it is known as atopic dermatitis. Eczema is believed to occur twice as frequently in children with dark skin. One study found its incidence is higher in Mexican- American teens than either whites or blacks. Other research found a greater incidence in Chinese and Vietnamese babies, compared with white babies. When eczema occurs in those with dark complexions, it presents a two-fold problem: It is often misdiagnosed, leading to long periods of no treatment or the wrong treatment. When not treated early on, it can increase the risk of pigmentation problems. Treatment for eczema consists of identifying and avoiding products that irritate skin. Use of moisturizer can help a lot, along with steroid creams. Sometimes, ultraviolet light therapy is effective. It is essential to seek help as soon as possible for any red, itchy rash. Doing so will help avoid pigmentation problems. Acne can occur in any skin type. But due to its link to hyperpigmentation, it is of greatest concern for people with dark skin. Acne develops when there is an overproduction of oil in the skin. That oil mixes with bacteria within the pores and blocks the pore openings. This causes inflammation just under the skin, which results in lesions -- anything from small, discreet bumps to large cysts. Not only can this trauma lead to pigmentation problems in dark skin, but so can many medications used to treat acne. This is also true of certain oral antibiotics, particularly minocycline. In some people, it can produce a darkening of the skin, which can take months to fade. If you have dark skin and develop acne, see a dermatologist skilled in treating ethnic complexions as soon as possible. The earlier you seek treatment, the less likely you are to suffer permanent pigmentation scars. This skin condition is characterized by bumps under the surface of the skin, and is often confused with acne. But the problem actually stems from ingrown hairs. It most often occurs in black and Hispanic people, due to the distinct shape of the hair follicle. If the bumps are squeezed or manipulated in any way, they can become inflamed or infected. But even when left alone, they can be difficult to cover and sometimes cause pain. Recent studies have shown that laser hair removal is an effective treatment. Because this condition is often confused with acne, it's important to have your diagnosis confirmed by a dermatologist familiar with dark skin. Any time dark skin is injured in certain areas, there's an increased risk of keloids -- a scar that spreads beyond the boundary of the original injury and develops into a growth. The most common causes of keloids are cuts or burns. The most common locations are the earlobes, chest, back, and arms. While they can develop immediately after an injury, they can also take months or even years to grow -- and they can continue growing over a period of time. In some people, keloids may itch, cause pain and burning, and be tender to the touch. Though no one is certain why keloids develop, they are thought to be linked to a defect in collagen production. Treatments include cortisone injections, radiation therapy, pressure dressings, and silicone gel applications. Keloids can also be removed via surgery or with a laser. Regardless of the treatment, keloids return between 45% and 100% of the time. In this condition, skin becomes depigmented. The loss of color causes large, white patches to appear. Vitiligo occurs in up to 2% of the population but is most noticeable in those with dark skin. Vitiligo is thought to develop when melanin-producing cells are damaged, though no one is certain why this happens. A genetic susceptibility perhaps triggered by a factor in the environment may result in an autoimmune disorder, causing destruction of pigment cells. When vitiligo hits the scalp, hair turns white -- and it's occasionally the cause of prematurely gray hair. Treatment includes various procedures to ""re-pigment"" the skin. One such method is controlled exposure to UV light, called phototherapy. This can help increase the amount of melanocyte cells at the skin's surface. Another approach uses the topical eczema oinment tacrolimus, which is sometimes effective. When applied to the skin twice daily, research shows, normal pigmentation may return, although it may take months. Still another approach is the use of strong steroid creams, which can be effective if used on certain areas of the body such as the face and neck. Although dark-skinned people have a natural protection against skin cancer, that doesn't mean it can't occur. It does -- most frequently where skin is lightest, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and around the nail bed. This is most true for Asians, Native Americans, and people of African descent. In Hispanics, melanoma occurs most frequently on the legs. Because it is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), tinea manuum (a fungus occurring on the palms of the hands), or a condition known as talon noir or black heel, and because many people do not seek treatment early on, the melanoma death rate is highest among people with dark skin. The lifesaving answer lies in awareness and early diagnosis."
508,"An electrophysiology ( EP) study is a test that records the electrical activity and the electrical pathways of your heart. This test is used to help determine the cause of your heart rhythm disturbance and the best treatment for you. During the EP study, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which one controls it best or to determine the best procedure or device to treat your heart rhythm. An electrophysiology study is used: To determine the cause of an abnormal heart rhythm To decide the best treatment for an abnormal heart rhythm Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain medications one to five days before your EP study. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetes drugs. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the EP study. If you must take medications, take them only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry or valuables at home. Your doctor will tell you if you can go home or must stay in the hospital after the procedure. If you are able to go home, bring a companion to drive you home. Before an electrophysiology study, you will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous ( IV) line into your arm or hand. This is so you can receive medications and fluids during the electrophysiology study. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The skin at the top of both of your legs will be shaved and cleansed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes are used to cover you, from your neck to your feet. A soft strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. An electrophysiologist (a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal heart rhythms) will numb your skin with medication and then insert several catheters into the veins beneath the skin. Guided by the fluoroscopy machine, the catheters are threaded to your heart. The catheters sense the electrical activity in your heart and are used to evaluate your heart's conduction system. The doctor will use a pacemaker to deliver the electrical impulses through one of the catheters to increase your heart rate. You may feel your heart beating faster or stronger. Your nurses and doctor will want to know about any symptoms you are feeling. If your arrhythmia occurs, your doctor may give you medications through your IV to test their effectiveness in controlling it. If necessary, a small amount of energy may be delivered by the patches on your chest to bring back a normal heart rhythm. Based on the information collected during the study, the doctor may continue with an ablation procedure. The EP study takes about two to four hours to perform. However, it can take longer if additional treatments such as catheter ablation are performed at the same time. The doctor will remove the catheters and apply pressure to the site, to prevent bleeding. You will be on bed rest for about one to two hours. An EP study allows the doctor to decide the best treatment for you. In many cases, EP testing and the therapy following can greatly reduce the likelihood of developing abnormal heart rhythms in the future. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or nurse."
509,"If you've ever had a cold sore, you know the signs. It starts with the tingling, then the edge of your lip or the corner of your mouth begins to burn. Then the outbreak: An ugly red sore appears. A few days later it breaks open and crusts over. Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a bother in more ways than one. They're not only painful, they can ruin your smile. When you feel one budding, you want to get rid of it, fast. But you probably don't need a doctor. There are things that you can do at home to soothe the pain and make cold sores look nicer as they heal. Cold sores are caused by a common virus called herpes simplex. Most people get exposed to the virus when they're babies or children. There's no cure for it. Once you've been exposed to it, it's always in your system, even if it doesn't often cause cold sores or other symptoms. Herpes simplex is spread by close contact. If you kiss someone with a cold sore, or you touch his face and then touch your own face, you can catch the virus. You can also get herpes simplex by sharing lip balm, a fork, a mug or a razor with someone who has it. You're most likely to get the virus from someone who has an active cold sore, but it's also possible to contract it from someone who doesn't have a sore or blister showing. The virus also can spread to the eyes or the genitals. For example, if you rub your eyes after getting saliva from an infected person on your hands, or if you receive oral sex from someone who has cold sores. When you're first exposed to the virus, you're likely to get a cold sore. After a week or two, it'll go away on its own. Then the virus goes dormant in your body. You may never have another cold sore outbreak again, but many people do. Some things that make an outbreak more likely are: A cold or other illness A fever Stress Too much sun Your period There are many that you can do at home to soothe the sting of a cold sore, such as: Ice. You can numb the pain if you apply a cold compress to the sore. Don't put ice directly on your skin -- that could damage it. Pain relievers. When a cold sore really stings, you may get some relief from an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen. Over-the-counter creams. There are products available at the drugstore that can help reduce the pain of a cold sore or help keep the skin soft while it heals. Aloe vera gel. The same gel used for sunburn may help a cold sore to heal. Lab research has shown the gel may help fight viruses, including herpes simplex. Avoid triggers. This means that if you know a hot, sunny day at the beach or a lot of stress makes you break out in cold sores, try to stay out of those situations when you can. You may be able to stop it in its tracks, or at least keep it from getting worse. Don't touch. If you pick your cold sore, you may spread the virus to another part of your body. That will just make your outbreak worse. Keep your hands away from your mouth, and wash your hands often, especially when you touch your face."
510,"A person who has autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) often has trouble communicating and interacting with other people; his or her interests, activities, and play skills may be limited. Occupational therapy may help people with autism develop these skills at home and in school. Occupational therapists study human growth and development and a person's interaction with the environment through daily activities. They are experts in the social, emotional, and physiological effects of illness and injury. This knowledge helps them promote skills for independent living in people with autism and other developmental disorders. Occupational therapists work as part of a team that includes parents, teachers, and other professionals. They help set specific goals for the person with autism. These goals often involve social interaction, behavior, and classroom performance. Occupational therapists can help in two main ways: evaluation and therapy. The therapist observes children to see if they can do tasks they are expected to do at their ages -- getting dressed or playing a game, for example. Sometimes, the therapist will have the child videotaped during the day in order to see how the child interacts with his or her environment so that he or she can better assess the kind of care the child needs. The therapist might note any of the following: Attention span and stamina Transition to new activities Play skills Need for personal space Responses to touch or other types of stimuli Motor skills such as posture, balance, or manipulation of small objects Aggression or other types of behaviors Interactions between the child and caregivers Once an occupational therapist has gathered information, he or she can develop a program for your child. There is no single ideal treatment program. But early, structured, individualized care has been shown to work best. Occupational therapy may combine a variety of strategies. These can help your child respond better to his or her environment. These OT strategies include: Physical activities, such as stringing beads or doing puzzles, to help a child develop coordination and body awareness Play activities to help with interaction and communication Developmental activities, such as brushing teeth and combing hair Adaptive strategies, including coping with transitions The overall goal of occupational therapy is to help the person with autism improve his or her quality of life at home and in school. The therapist helps introduce, maintain, and improve skills so that people with autism can be as independent as possible. These are some of the skills occupational therapy may foster: Daily living skills, such as toilet training, dressing, brushing teeth, and other grooming skills Fine motor skills required for holding objects while handwriting or cutting with scissors Gross motor skills used for walking, climbing stairs, or riding a bike Sitting, posture, or perceptual skills, such as telling the differences between colors, shapes, and sizes Awareness of his or her body and its relation to others Visual skills for reading and writing Play, coping, self-help, problem solving, communication, and social skills By working on these skills during occupational therapy, a child with autism may be able to: Develop peer and adult relationships Learn how to focus on tasks Learn how to delay gratification Express feelings in more appropriate ways Engage in play with peers Learn how to self-regulate You may have heard a lot about sensory integration therapy. That's because some researchers estimate that eight out of 10 children with autism have problems processing sensory input. For example, they can't filter out background noise. Other signs of processing issues include: Problems with balance Problems with body position in space Oversensitivity to touch and the feel of certain types of clothing, such as socks with seams With autism, social, behavioral, or attention problems can be partly a result of these sensory challenges. Although more research is needed, OT can help with sensory integration and some of the related behavioral problems. Research suggests sensory integration therapy is less helpful in improving academic performance. Examples of sensory integration therapy include: Being brushed or deeply touched and massaged Compressing elbows and knees Swinging Spinning on a scooter Wearing a weighted vest You can obtain occupational therapy services either privately, through a statewide early childhood intervention program, or at school. Public law requires schools to provide certain types of occupational therapy to those who need it. Private insurance also usually covers OT. In addition, Medicaid may cover occupational therapy for autism, even for families with higher incomes. School-based OT tends to be more functional in nature. Typically, it works as an adjunct to educational goals, such as improving handwriting, so the child can keep up by taking notes. Private therapy will be more medically intensive."

Most people have some sort of imbalance in the size of their breathing passages. In fact, estimates indicate that 80% of people, most unknowingly, have some sort of misalignment to their nasal septum. Only the more severe imbalances cause significant breathing problems and require treatment. Some people are born with a deviated septum. Other people develop a deviated septum after injury or trauma to the nose. The most common symptom of a deviated septum is nasal congestion, with one side of the nose being more congested than the other, along with difficulty breathing. Recurrent or repeated sinus infections can also be a sign of a deviated septum. Other symptoms include frequent: Nosebleeds Facial pain Headache Postnasal drip Loud breathing and snoring during sleep A deviated septum may also cause sleep apnea, a serious condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep. Sometimes symptoms of a deviated septum can be relieved with medications. If medicine alone doesn't offer adequate relief, a surgical procedure called septoplasty may be needed to repair a crooked septum and improve breathing. During septoplasty, a surgeon, working through the inside of the nose, makes a small incision in the septum and then removes the excess bone or cartilage required to even out the breathing space of the nostrils. Sometimes, a rhinoplasty, or ""nose job,"" is combined with septoplasty to improve the appearance of the nose. This procedure is called septorhinoplasty. Septoplasty may also be combined with sinus surgery. Surgery to repair a deviated septum is usually performed in an outpatient setting under local or general anesthesia and takes about one to one and a half hours, depending on the amount of work being done. You should be able to go home three to four hours after surgery. Internal splints or soft packing material may be put in the nose to stabilize the septum as it heals. If a septoplasty is the only procedure performed, there should be little to no swelling or bruising after surgery. However, if a septorhinoplasty is performed, a week or two of swelling and bruising is normal following the procedure. If possible, it is best to wait until after the nose has stopped growing, around age 15, to have surgery. Newer procedures are becoming available that use balloon septoplasty techniques that avoid actual surgery and are done in the office setting. These are being done for milder cases. No surgery is completely risk-free, and the benefits of undergoing surgery -- in this case, being able to breathe better -- must outweigh the risks. Septoplasty and septorhinoplasty are common and safe procedures; side effects are rare. Still, talk with your doctor about the possible risks of surgery before you make a treatment decision. Although rare, risks of septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty may include: Infection Bleeding Hole (perforation) of the septum Loss of the ability to smell If you are having nasal symptoms and think you may have a deviated septum, make an appointment to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT. There are a number of reasons why you may be experiencing these symptoms, including chronic sinusitis or nasal allergies. Make sure you get the right diagnosis so that you can get the treatment you need."
512,"Use RICE method: Rest the injured area and keep weight off it. Feeling pain is usually an indication that you are doing too much too soon. Ice the injured area to ease swelling. Compress injury by gently wrapping with an elastic bandage. Specialized braces from your health care provider can also be used to provide compression. Elevate injured area above the heart level, if possible. Give an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen ( Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen ( Tylenol). The person should call his/her health care provider as soon as possible. An orthopedic specialist might be recommended. The doctor will examine the injured area and may do an X-ray, MRI, or other tests. The person may be given a sling, cast, crutches, brace, or other device. The person may be prescribed medications. The person may be referred for physical therapy or to a specialist, such as an orthopedic surgeon. Surgery may be needed."
513,"Stomach cancer begins when cancer cells form in the inner lining of your stomach. These cells can grow into a tumor. Also called gastric cancer, the disease usually grows slowly over many years. If you know the symptoms it causes, you and your doctor may be able to spot it early, when it's easiest to treat. Scientists don't know exactly what makes cancer cells start growing in the stomach. But they do know a few things that can raise your risk for the disease. One of them is infection with a common bacteria, H. pylori, which causes ulcers. Inflammation in your gut called gastritis, a certain type of long-lasting anemia called pernicious anemia, and growths in your stomach called polyps also can make you more likely to get cancer. Other things that seem to play a role in raising the risk include: Smoking Being overweight or obese A diet high in smoked, pickled, or salty foods Stomach surgery for an ulcer Type- A blood Epstein- Barr virus infection Certain genes Working in coal, metal, timber, or rubber industries Exposure to asbestos Early on, stomach cancer may cause: Indigestion Feeling bloated after you eat a meal Heartburn Slight nausea Loss of appetite Just having indigestion or heartburn after a meal doesn't mean you have cancer. But if you feel these symptoms a lot, talk to your doctor. He can see if you have other risk factors and test you to look for any problems. As stomach tumors grow, you may have more serious symptoms, such as: Stomach pain Blood in your stool Vomiting Weight loss for no reason Trouble swallowing Yellowish eyes or skin Swelling in your stomach Constipation or diarrhea Weakness or feeling tired Heartburn Doctors typically don't do routine screening for stomach cancer. That's mainly because it's not that common, so getting extra tests often isn't helpful. If you're at higher risk for it though, talk to your doctor to see how to keep an eye out for it. You may get some of the same tests that you would get if you had symptoms and were looking for a diagnosis. To find out if you have stomach cancer, your doctor starts with a physical exam. He'll also ask about your medical history to see if you have any risk factors for stomach cancer or any family members who've had it. Then, he might give you some tests, including: Blood tests to look for signs of cancer in your body. Upper endoscopy. Your doctor will put a thin, flexible tube with a small camera down your throat to look into your stomach. Upper GI series test. You'll drink a chalky liquid with a substance called barium. The fluid coats your stomach and makes it show up more clearly on X-rays. CT scan . This is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Biopsy . Your doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your stomach to look at under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. He might do this during an endoscopy. Many treatments can fight stomach cancer. The one you and your doctor choose will depend on how long you've had the disease or how much it has spread in your body, called the stage of your cancer: Stage 0. This is when the inside lining of your stomach has a group of unhealthy cells that may turn into cancer. Surgery usually cures it. Your doctor may remove part or all of your stomach, as well as nearby lymph nodes -- small organs that are part of your body's germ-fighting system. Stage I. At this point, you have a tumor in your stomach's lining, and it may have spread into your lymph nodes. As with stage 0, you'll likely have surgery to remove part or all of your stomach and nearby lymph nodes. You might also get chemotherapy or chemoradiation. These treatments can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor and afterward to kill any cancer that's left. Chemotherapy uses drugs to attack cancer cells. Chemoradiation is chemo plus radiation therapy, which destroys cancer cells with beams of high energy. Stage II. Cancer has spread into deeper layers of the stomach and maybe into nearby lymph nodes. Surgery to remove part or all of your stomach, as well as nearby lymph nodes, is still the main treatment. You're very likely to get chemo or chemoradiation beforehand, and you might get one of them after, too. Stage III. The cancer may now be in all layers of the stomach, as well as other organs close by, like the spleen or colon. Or, it may be smaller but reach deep into your lymph nodes. You usually have surgery to remove your entire stomach, along with chemo or chemoradiation. This can sometimes cure it. If not, it can at least help with symptoms. If you're too sick for surgery, you may get chemo, radiation, or both, depending on what your body can handle. Stage IV. In this last stage, cancer has spread far and wide to organs like the liver, lungs, or brain. It's much harder to cure, but your doctor can help manage it and give you some relief from symptoms. If the tumor blocks part of your GI system, you may get: A procedure that destroys part of the tumor with a laser on an endoscope, a thin tube that slides down your throat. A thin metal tube called a stent that can keep things flowing. You can get one of these between your stomach and esophagus or between your stomach and small intestine. Gastric bypass surgery to create a route around the tumor. Surgery to remove part of your stomach. Chemo, radiation, or both may be used at this stage, too. You might also get targeted therapy. These drugs attack cancer cells, but leave healthy ones alone, which may mean fewer side effects. Treat stomach infections. If you have ulcers from an H. pylori infection, get treatment. Antibiotics can kill the bacteria, and other drugs will heal the sores in the lining of your stomach to cut your risk of cancer. Eat healthy. Get more fresh fruits and vegetables on your plate every day. They're high in fiber and in some vitamins that can lower your cancer risk. Avoid very salty, pickled, cured, or smoked foods like hot dogs, processed lunch meats, or smoked cheeses. Keep your weight at a healthy level, too. Being overweight or obese can also raise your risk of the disease. Don't smoke. Your stomach cancer risk doubles if you use tobacco. Watch aspirin or NSAID use. If you take daily aspirin to prevent heart problems or NSAID drugs for arthritis, talk to your doctor about how these drugs might affect your stomach."
514,"Your child uses their hips every day for walking, crawling, sitting, or standing. Because of this, hip problems can come up. This can make it hard for them to move the right way. If your child has a hip problem, she may have hip pain, but she may also have pain in her knee or thigh instead. She might start to limp. Or she may be in too much pain to walk at all. Your child's hip could hurt for lots of reasons. It may be because of problems they were born with. Infections, injuries, and other things can cause it, too. If your child has this common cause of hip pain, they may limp and tell you their hip hurts after sitting for a long time. They'll also walk with their toes pointed outward. They may walk on the tips of their toes, have knee or thigh pain, or refuse to walk if the pain is very bad. Your baby will cry when you move their hip joint. This problem is most common in preschool and elementary students. Boys get it more often than girls. Doctors don't know why, but it happens a lot in children who've had a virus. It may be a side effect of the body's fight against it. Your child's pediatrician may prescribe anti-inflammatory medicine, sometimes with pain meds. Within a few weeks, they should feel better, without any lingering problems. At baby well visits, doctors check the movements of your baby's hips. This is because in some babies, one or both hips didn't develop quite right. Some babies are born with the problem. Others have it after they're born. It's more common in girls. Doctors think the hormones babies get in the womb may relax the hips too much. It may be more common among kids born breech -- with their feet or hips first. A doctor may put your baby in a soft brace that keeps their knees bent for several months. This usually takes care of the problem. In rare cases, your child may need surgery. Different kinds of it can cause hip pain in children. The most common type is juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA). If your child has it, they may feel stiffness or have swelling in more than one joint. Their hips may be stiff as well. Your child may also have an unusual walk or have a fever for unknown reasons. Doctors aren't sure what causes JIA, but it may be linked to a virus. It's most common in children before they hit puberty. Doctors often treat it with medicine and physical therapy. If the rounded top of the thighbone (femoral head) that fits into the hip socket (pelvis) doesn't get enough blood, the bone is more likely to break. It also won't heal as well as a healthy bone would. This can cause your child to limp or have stiffness and pain in the hip, knee, or thigh. Doctors don't know why blood stops flowing to the hip joint in some children. It's more common among kids up to age 8. Boys are more likely to have it. Doctors can treat it with crutches, a cast, physical therapy, or surgery. Having Legg- Calve- Perthes disease after age 6 makes someone more likely to have hip problems as an adult. This is a fracture along the growth plate under the ball joint in the hip. It's kind of like ice cream falling off the cone. This causes pain, sometimes in the hip but other times in the thigh or knee. Sometimes, your child may need crutches. Other times, they can't walk or move their leg because the pain is so severe. It's more common in older children (from age 8 into teenage years) and those who are overweight. Boys get it more often. Surgery is a common treatment. Many children recover fully, but they're more likely to have arthritis of the hip as adults. A number of them can cause pain in your child's hip. This may make them limp or give them trouble walking. One condition, called septic arthritis, can cause painful hip swelling and redness. It may be caused by bacteria (like a staph infection), a virus, or even a fungus. Other bacterial infections or Lyme disease (which your child may get from the bite of an infected tick) can also cause hip pain. Antibiotics may be all that's needed to treat some infections. Other times, your child may need a procedure to drain the infection from the joint. Sometimes, an injury can cause hip pain. In rare cases, a tumor in the hip can cause it as well. If pain is severe or it stops your child from walking, take her to the doctor right away. Your child may need a blood test, X-ray, or MRI. Once the doctor figures out what's causing the problem, he'll offer a treatment."
515,"Great strides have been made in the understanding of pain and its treatment in the last decade. Pain that was once considered hopeless is now manageable. Medical evidence proves that many of the beliefs about pain and pain relief are false. Here's what experts say you should know about five of the most common pain relief myths. This myth persists among bodybuilders and weekend athletes. Yet there is no evidence to support the notion that you can build strength by exerting muscles to the point of pain. A related belief, "" Work through the pain,"" is also mistaken. Resting to repair muscles and bring pain relief might not be macho, but it's a smart thing to do. You may also need to modify your exercise routine with cross training; lighter, more frequent workouts; and proper shoes. Pain is a complex problem, involving both the mind and the body. For instance, back pain has no known cause in most cases, and stressful life events can make it worse. But that doesn't mean it isn't real. Pain is an invisible problem that others can't see, but that doesn't mean it's all in your head. There are countless options for pain relief. They include relaxation techniques, exercise, physical therapy, over-the-counter and prescription medications, surgery, injections (into muscle, joints or your back), and complementary treatments such as acupuncture and massage. It may not always be possible to completely get rid of your pain, but you can use many techniques to help manage it much better. Older adults are more prone than their kids or grandkids to ""grin and bear it."" Enduring the occasional headache or minor sports injury is one thing. But putting up with chronic pain can impair functioning and quality of life. It can lead to depression, fatigue from loss of sleep, anxiety, inability to work, and impaired relationships. Most pain can be treated effectively and should be. If you are suffering from pain, you owe it to yourself to make an appointment with your doctor. Relief may be just around the corner. Health care providers begin with a conservative approach to pain relief and prescribe non-narcotic pain-relief medications, which are not addictive. Doctors may prescribe narcotics, such as codeine and morphine, if pain becomes severe, such as when treating cancer pain. Many people fear that they will become addicted to narcotics. Physical dependence is not the same thing as addiction. And, physical dependence isn't a problem as long as you do not stop taking the narcotics suddenly. Addiction to narcotics is not usually a problem, unless you have a history of recreational drug or alcohol addiction. If you do, discuss this with your health care provider before starting any pain medicine. Remember pain can be a chronic condition like any other and may be a life long problem that requires life long lifestyle changes."

517,"Pain in your shoulder can have many causes. You might injure it in a fall or accident, or you could have overdone a chore like painting. Sometimes shoulder pain comes from a condition like arthritis. It can even stem from problems in other parts of your body, which is called referred pain. Ask yourself some questions to help you decide if you have a shoulder injury: Can you move your arm normally, or is your shoulder too stiff or painful? Do you feel like your shoulder could pop out of the socket? Is your shoulder strong enough for things you normally do? You can treat some shoulder injuries at home for a few days with rest and ice. You can bandage it to hold it in place if necessary, and elevate it above the heart. But some injuries need professional help. Here are signs that you need to see a doctor right away: Your shoulder joint looks deformed. You can't use your shoulder at all. The pain is intense. The shoulder is swelling suddenly. Your arm or hand is weak or numb. Dislocation. If your shoulder is pulled back too hard or rotated too far, the top of your arm might pop out of its socket. You will feel pain and weakness in your shoulder. You may also have swelling, numbness and bruising. Separation. This injury affects the joint where your collarbone and shoulder blade come together. It's called the acromioclavicular ( AC) joint. A fall or hard blow tears the ligaments holding it together. If your collarbone gets pushed out of place, you'll have a bump on top of your shoulder. Fracture. A bone can break or crack if you fall or take a hard hit. The most common breaks are to the clavicle (collarbone) and the humerus (arm bone closest to your shoulder). You'll have a lot of pain and it may bruise. If your collarbone is broken, your shoulder can sag and you might not be able to lift your arm. Cartilage tear. You can injure the cartilage (the rubbery padding) that goes around the rim of your shoulder joint. It can happen after doing the same motion over and over. You can also hurt it in a fall, or anytime your shoulder absorbs a lot of force. With this type of injury, you might feel pain when you reach over your head, and your shoulder could seem weak. It might also feel like it's catching, locking, or grinding. Rotator cuff tear. Your rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons in your shoulder that hold your arm in place and let you lift your arm up overhead. You can damage it through overuse or in a fall. It also begins to show wear and tear as you age. Your shoulder may hurt at night and when you try to lift things. You might hear a crackling sound when you move it. Frozen shoulder. This condition limits how much your joint will move. Abnormal bands of tissue (adhesions) build up in the joint and keep your shoulder from moving freely. Your shoulder might âfreezeâ because pain or surgery have made you use it less, allowing the adhesions to build up. Impingement. This happens when the tendons of the rotator cuff get pinched in the bones of the shoulder. It can cause swelling and pain. If you lift your arms over your head a lot, it can set this off. Bursitis. The bursa (a fluid-filled sac that cushions in your joint) can get swollen and irritated if you repeat the same motions over and over again. But it can also be caused by a fall or another injury. If you have bursitis, you may notice the pain most when you move your shoulder. Osteoarthritis . Also called degenerative joint disease, this is the most common form of arthritis. It can affect any joint, including your shoulders. The cartilage between bones breaks down, and they rub together. This can cause pain and stiffness. Rheumatoid arthritis. This is a disease that causes your body's immune system to attack the protective lining in your joints. It can also cause pain and stiffness in your shoulders. Referred pain. Sometimes your shoulders hurt when there's nothing wrong with them. This can be a sign of trouble with your gallbladder, liver or another organ. Heart attack. If your shoulder hurts and you have trouble breathing or your chest feels tight, you might need emergency medical help right away. For dislocations, separations and fractures, you need a doctor's help to get your shoulder back in the right position and then a sling to hold it in place while it heals. For many other issues, your doctor may suggest rest, heat or ice and a medicine like ibuprofen or aspirin to reduce the pain and swelling. If your shoulder doesn't improve after these first steps, your doctor may try injecting a corticosteroid (an anti-inflammatory medicine) straight into the joint to relieve swelling and pain. Sometimes cartilage tears, rotator cuff tears and frozen shoulder don't improve with rest and medicine. Your doctor may recommend surgery. With any problem in your shoulder, your treatment plan will probably include exercises to help you stretch and strengthen the joint, and to improve your range of motion."
518,"Doctors have used chemotherapy (chemo) to treat cancer since the 1950s. The advantage to these drugs is they kill cancer cells throughout your body. One downside is the side effects they can cause -- including upset stomach. In the past, people who got chemo had to live with the intense nausea and vomiting. That's no longer true. Today, doctors have many drugs to stop -- and even prevent -- them. Your body sees the medicine as foreign. It sets off warning signals in your brain and digestive system. This flips the on switch in a part of your brain called the vomiting center. It puts out chemicals that make you queasy. Chemo can harm your digestive tract, too, which could also lead to nausea. Chemo can cause three different types of nausea and vomiting: Acute starts within a few hours of your treatment. Delayed won't kick in until 24 hours after treatment. It can last a few days Anticipatory starts before you get chemo, because you expect to feel sick. Constant vomiting can take a toll. It can leave you weak, dry your body out, and steal nutrients it needs. You might also get an electrolyte imbalance, which means you don't have enough of things like sodium and potassium that make your systems run. If you feel very sick, you might have to lower your chemotherapy dose or stop the treatment entirely. Some types of chemo are more likely than others to make you sick. It happens more often with the drugs cisplatin ( Platinol) and doxorubicin ( Adriamycin). You're also more likely to have these problems if you: Get several chemotherapy treatments close together Take a high dose Get the drug through a vein instead of by mouth Are female Are younger than 50 Tend to get motion sickness Your doctor can give you medicine before your treatment to prevent sickness. You might take one of these medicines to block signals to the part of your brain that makes you ill: Aprepitant ( Cinvanti, Emend) Dolasetron ( Anzemet) Fosnetupitant/palonosetron ( Akynzeo) Granisetron ( Kytril, Sustol, Sancuso) Ondansetron ( Zofran, Zuplenz) Palonosetron ( Aloxi) Rolapitant ( Varubi) You get these medicines through a vein ( IV) or by mouth. Akynzeo and Aloxi keep working for a few days, so they can prevent delayed nausea and vomiting. A few other types of drugs can also help: Anti-anxiety drugs: alprazolam ( Niravam, Xanax), diazepam ( Valium), and lorazepam ( Ativan) Cannabinoids: abilone ( Cesamet)dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) Corticosteroids: dexamethasone ( Decadron, Hexadrol)methylprednisolone ( Medrol) Dopamine antagonists: metoclopramide ( Reglan)prochlorperazine Motion sickness medicines: scopolamine patch ( Transderm Scop) Drugs aren't the only option. You might try a complementary therapy -- a type of treatment that's outside traditional medicine but can be used along with it to ease your symptoms. Acupuncture is a form of Chinese traditional medicine that uses fine needles to stimulate various pressure points around your body. The idea is to restore your natural energy flow. The practitioner may even add an electric current to boost the effect. The point that's often used to treat nausea is called P6. It's located on the underside of the wrist, a couple of inches below your hand. Side effects are usually mild, including pain and minor bleeding where the needles go in. Acupressure is similar acupuncture, but uses firm pressure instead of needles. Biofeedback teaches you how to control body functions that usually happen automatically. You can learn how to slow your heart rate or breathing to calm you down. Hypnosis gets you into a state where you're focused and open to suggestion. You can go to a hypnotist or use self-hypnosis to bring about changes in behavior. Taking your mind off your treatment can help you manage the sickness. Try these techniques to relax or distract yourself before chemotherapy: Guided imagery. Use your imagination to picture yourself in a calming scene -- like a tranquil village by a lake. Imagine your stress drifting away from you like a boat sailing off on the current. Distraction. Listen to music, read a book, or watch a funny movie to take your mind off the treatment ahead. Progressive muscle relaxation. Start at your feet. Tense and then relax each muscle group in your body. By the time you reach your head, you should feel much calmer. You can also make a few changes to what you eat and your daily routine to prevent and relieve nausea: Avoid any foods that make you feel sick. Common culprits include fatty, fried, and strong-smelling foods. Eat several small meals throughout the day instead of three big meals. Have a snack before your chemo treatment. Don't cook when you don't feel well. The smell of warming food can make nausea worse. Eat cold foods if the smell of hot food bothers you. Drink extra water and other fluids so you don't get dehydrated. Eat candied ginger or drink flat ginger ale or ginger tea to settle your stomach."

Your doctor will call them B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) and N-terminal-pro- BNP ( NT-pro- BNP). Levels of both in your blood go up when your heart failure gets worse and go down when it gets better. A test called a BNP blood test measures those two important levels. It's able to spot heart failure more than 80% of the time. BNP levels help your doctor figure out if you have heart failure or something else that has similar symptoms such as shortness of breath. The test also shows if your heart failure has worsened. It'll help your doctor decide what treatments you need and if you need to be hospitalized. It may also give him a look into what the future may hold. It is a sensitive test to allow the doctor to evaluate improvement or worsening of heart failure and to help monitor whether or not the medication is working well. Depending on your medical center, you may get tested for one or both proteins. A small amount of blood will be taken from you. Then it's placed in a machine that reads the level of BNP and NT-pro- BNP. The test takes about 15 minutes. In some places, the blood sample needs to be sent away to a lab to be tested. The level of BNP tends to increase as heart failure gets worse. But it can also increase with age. Testing BNP levels is one of the most sensitive ways to show how well you're doing on heart failure treatment. Ask your doctor to explain the results of your BNP tests."
520,"If you're like most people in the U. S., you likely don't get enough potassium in your diet. Like calcium and sodium, potassium is a mineral that's found in some foods. Having the right amount of potassium in your diet helps to keep you healthy, so it's crucial to eat plenty of potassium-rich foods. Many of the foods that you already eat contain potassium. The foods listed below are high in potassium. If you need to boost the amount of potassium in your diet, make healthy food choices by picking items below to add to your menu. Many fresh fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium: Bananas, oranges, cantaloupe, honeydew, apricots, grapefruit (some dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and dates, are also high in potassium) Cooked spinach Cooked broccoli Potatoes Sweet potatoes Mushrooms Peas Cucumbers Zucchini Eggplant Pumpkins Leafy greens Juice from potassium-rich fruit is also a good choice: Orange juice Tomato juice Prune juice Apricot juice Grapefruit juice Certain dairy products, such as milk and yogurt, are high in potassium (low-fat or fat-free is best). Some fish contain potassium: Tuna Halibut Cod Trout Rockfish Beans or legumes that are high in potassium include: Lima beans Pinto beans Kidney beans Soybeans Lentils Other foods that are rich in potassium include: Salt substitutes (read labels to check potassium levels) Molasses Nuts Meat and poultry Brown and wild rice Bran cereal Whole-wheat bread and pasta You should get 4,700 milligrams (mg) of potassium every day. Most Americans don't meet that goal. Your needs might be different if you have kidney disease. Some people with kidney disease should get less potassium than the 4,700 mg guideline. If your kidneys don't work well, too much potassium could stay in your body, which can cause nerve and muscle problems. If you have kidney disease and your doctor hasn't already told you what your potassium limit is, ask about it. For a long time, potassium wasn't listed on the Nutrition Facts food labels of packaged food items. But in May 2016, the Nutrition Facts rules were changed, and potassium will now be listed. Companies will need to update their food labels on or before January 2020. That should make it easier for you to track your potassium intake for better health. For starters, it helps your blood pressure. It does this in two different ways: First, with the aid your kidneys, potassium helps remove extra sodium from your body through your urine. This is a good thing, because too much sodium can cause high blood pressure. Second, potassium helps the walls of your blood vessels to relax or loosen up. When they're too tense or rigid, it can lead to high blood pressure, which can cause heart problems. Getting enough potassium is good for your heart. You also need enough potassium for good muscle health -- so that your muscles can flex or contract the way they should. And your nerves need potassium so that they can work well."
